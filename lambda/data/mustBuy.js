		"review":"Democratic strategist, Gary Zimmer is reeling from Hilary Clinton's loss in 2016.  He decides they need a new rural friendly message.  He has found his guy.  One of his aides played Gary a viral video of Colonel Jack Hastings arguing in a town hall meeting in Deerlaken, Wisconsin.  Jack argues against showing IDs to receive public assistance. Gary thinks he can turn Jack into a Democrat, then change the community by getting Jack elected mayor of Deerlaken.  Gary wants Jack to be a fresh face of the Democratic Party with his gruff exterior and left ideas. At first Jack says no, but changes his mind.  Jack has decided to run for mayor. Gary thinks this will be an easy win, but one semicolon will strike fear in his heart.  Republican strategist, Faith Brewster, is in town.<br/><br/>This movie shows the dirty side of politics on both sides.  It poignantly describes how one party leads with fear while the other leads with shame.  While both argue they are morally right, it all comes down to money.  With focus groups, statisticians, and super PACs, the money is the only focus and concern. This movie provides plenty of laughs, satirical undertones of the horrible nature of both parties, and false endings like Vice.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"A new but experienced group of soldiers deploy to PRT Kamdesh in 2006.  When they land, they see the dire situation in the terrain.  In a valley, three mountains surround the men.  At any moment, the Taliban can perch on a hill and strike.  Every day they are met with attacks and wonder when the big one will come.  While defending themselves, the men must convince the locals to put down their weapons and fight against the Taliban. With little supplies, no plumbing, and worried family members at home, these men keep their orders and country in their hearts. They deal with spies, customs, and an alarmist interpreter before the Battle of Kamdesh.<br/><br/>Based on The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor by Jake Tapper, The Outpost is a gripping movie.  It uses the first hour to get to know the men and their camaraderie.  The second hour is the battle with no relief. You will be on edge with every move these soldiers make on known and unknown terrain.  If you or a loved one has war-induced PTSD, The Outpost may be a trigger.  Otherwise, this movie is worth the rental money.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Then, Donnie laughs at Jimmy because he dropped his ice cream.  When Jimmy refuses Donnie, Donnie hits Jimmy.  Lorna comes to Jimmy's defense, and Donnie hits her too.  They leave.  Margaret doesn't tell George what she saw at the grocery store.  Instead, she makes a cake and takes it to Donnie's home, but the family is gone. Margaret comes home and prepares for a trip.  When George gets home, he knows something is wrong. Margaret believes Lorna can't defend herself and their grandson.  So Margaret will get Jimmy back. George closes his suitcase, and they head down the road.  George and Margaret don't know the Weboy Family is powerful in North Dakota.  The matriarch, Blanche, rules with an iron fist, shotgun, and a lit cigarette. She will never let any of the Weboys walk away again, including Jimmy.<br/><br/>Based on Let Him Go by Larry Watson, this movie is a slow burn but picks up at the end.  Just a warning, some scenes can be pretty gruesome.  But what you are witnessing is three mothers fighting for the boy they love. In the end, it all comes down to Jimmy and how much people are willing to sacrifice to keep him. Viewers get a Kill Bill Vol. 2 moment, and it's worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tom met Annie a year ago at a storage facility where she worked, and he wants to continue his future with her without looking over his shoulder every day.  The FBI knows Tom as the In-and-Out Bandit. Tom buys a house for him and Annie, then he goes to a motel and calls the FBI.  Agent Sam Baker picks up the phone and doesn't believe Tom's story. So, he gives the phone to his partner, Detective Meyers. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million.  He is willing to give it all back if they give him what he wants.  Tom wants to be held for a maximum of two years in a minimum-security prison with full visitation rights.  Meyers still doesn't believe him, so they hand the case to Agent Ramon Hall and Agent Jason Nivens. After meeting Tom, they believe Tom is another liar, so Tom tells them how he committed the crimes.  Tom gives them the location of $3 million.  They go to the storage unit expecting to find nothing.  However, they find the motherload.  John gets an idea.  They can take the money, kill Tom, and tell Baker and Meyers it was all a hoax. Ramon hangs his head and says yes. Ramon and John walk into the hotel room, and John is prepared to kill Tom, but there is a knock at the door.  It's Agent Baker.  Baker walks inside but can tell something is off, then John shoots him point-blank in the head. Tom jumps in Annie's car and drives away.  Tom has to come clean with the woman he loves, clear his name of murder, and peacefully turn himself in before John and Ramon kill him and Annie.<br/><br/>Yes, this is another Liam Neeson kills-everyone movie, but that's why it's fun.  Tom never claims to be perfect or a good guy.  However, he tells everyone he is honest. It's interesting to contrast what drives each pair to fight together.  Tom and Annie find strength through love and the future.  And for Myers, he fights to get justice for Baker and find the person who killed him.  For Ramon and John, their partnership stands on blackmail and money.  Seeing the pairs work together or for each other changes throughout the film, and it will be their downfall or salvation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"As a child, Abe Applebaum had a nose for mysteries.  His principal came to Abe with his first case when Abe was 13.  It was the case of the missing fundraiser money.  Abe picks a suspect, and the principal recovered the money.  Soon, Abe was running a business out of his treehouse, and the police even called to consult him on bigger cases.  When someone chopped down his treehouse, the thankful town got him an office on Main Street.  The mayor's daughter, Grace, was his receptionist, and he paid her with soda.  His business was booming, and Abe was in the newspaper every week, but that all changed when Grace went missing.  The town and Abe expected Abe to find her, but when he couldn't, Abe's town and Abe fell into a depression.  Today, at 32, Abe is self-loathing, solves mediocre mysteries, and has more debt than cases. As he walks home from work, he sees police combing through the river. The police found Caroline's 15-year-old boyfriend stabbed to death in the river, and they have no leads. So, Caroline asks him to find who murdered her boyfriend.  He asks if she is sure because the truth can be shocking.  Caroline is sure and hires Abe.  This murder case will be his first adult case and a chance to clear Grace's case from his soul.<br/><br/>This movie goes from Encyclopedia Brown to 8mm in less than two hours.  It's a mix of Criminal Minds' unsubs with Psych's hijinks and wit.  You will laugh at the inappropriateness of Abe as he hides in a little girl's bedroom after spying on a teenage boy.  This story is perfection because Abe carries the weight of the town on his shoulders, and you can see the moment the weight lifts.  If you have ever gone through a hard time, you will connect with Abe's tears. When Abe finds the murderer, he will learn the truth about his town and himself.  This movie will become a cult classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
