    "review":"In 5 years, the Systar aliens have changed Bricksburg to Apocalypseburg.  Now General Sweet Mayhem has kidnapped Emmet's friends to convince Batman to marry Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi.  Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.  This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

The Skrulls uncover memories she thought were dreams.  She escapes the machine and jumps into an escape pod that veers off course to C-53, a.k.a. Earth.  On earth, Vers will learn the truth about her powers, the Kree, and the Skrulls.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the MCU need to watch the other films before watching this movie.  There are a lot of jokes and references to the past and present that will not make sense without knowledge of these movies.  With so much history to cover before the initial story, the first 10 minutes feels extremely rushed.  If you miss it, you will miss everything.  And 90s babies, be ready for some nostalgia.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She will need her faith, her family, and her pastor to get her through as she prays for her son.<br/><br/>This movie will have you in tears.
