    "review":"Gwen quits another band and worries her father, Captain George, and Aunt May on Earth-65. During her school dance, a massive lizard tore through the party. Gwen jumped into costume and killed the mutant, but sadly learned the lizard was her mutated friend, Peter Parker. As she cried over her friend, George entered with his gun drawn. He assumes Spider-Woman killed Peter, and now he tracks Spider-Woman's every move.<br/><br/>George gets a call over the walkie-talkie that a monster broke into the Guggenheim Museum and leaves because he thinks Spider-Woman will be there. Gwen hears the call, puts on her costume, and follows them. She realizes the monster is the Vulture, but it's not of her world. Then, a portal opens, and Miguel O'Hara and Jessica Drew capture Vulture. She can tell they are from another universe and asks to join them. Jessica likes the idea, but Miguel says no. George escapes his webs and points a gun at Spider-Woman. Gwen reveals her identity to George, and he begins to read Gwen her rights. Gwen walks through the portal and leaves George behind.<br/><br/>Miles balances Spider-Man duties with his education on Earth-1610. His parents, Jeff and Rio, wait for Miles as they sit with his guidance counselor. In another part of Brooklyn, Miles faces a new villain called The Spot, a.k.a. Dr. Jonathan Ohnn. During the Alchemax explosion, portals engulfed Jonathan's body. Miles defeats him and leaves him on a rooftop for the authorities. Miles slides into his counselor's meeting and tells his parents he wants to attend Princeton. Miles Spider-sense tingles, and he abruptly leaves the meeting to recapture The Spot.<br/><br/>As Miles zones out to music, Gwen opens a portal and persuades Miles to leave the house. Miles follows Gwen through a portal to Earth-50101 when he discovers the truth. In that universe, Pavitr Prabhakah is Spider-Man in Mumbattan. Before battling The Spot in Pavitr's universe, they meet Hobie Brown, Spider-Punk. The Spot absorbs the powers of Pavitar's universe's Alchemax before the Spider-people can stop him. Miles gets a vision of Jeff dying during his next battle with The Spot. Then, the Spot disappears with Mumbattan glitching around them, and Miles risks his life to save a little girl and an Inspector from the collapsing universe. Gwen thinks it's time for Miles to enter the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>She loves having him there, but Miguel thinks it's a massive mistake because Miles caused the multiverse portals that allowed villains to escape their Earth. And to make matters worse, Miles stopped a Canon Event from happening when he saved the Inspector. Peter B. Parker joins them and explains that Canon Events are necessary for every Spider-Person to develop. Miles puts the pieces together and realizes they know Jeff will die. Miles wants to save Jeff, but the Spider-People stop him. They tell him that he can't save one person and sacrifice everyone else. Miles believes he can save Jeff and Earth-1610, but he must first break free of the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>This sequel is better than its predecessor and worth a visit to the theaters. Viewers get new versions of Spider-People with unique animation styles. Each new character, including the villains, has a rich backstory and superb wit. The writers added easter eggs from all 3 Spider-Man franchises. You will laugh with pure joy and excitement throughout this film. If the animation wasn't astounding enough, this film has more drama than a telenovela. There is one mid-credit scene. And the film ends on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maddie runs outside to see her ex-fling, Doug, hooking her car to his tow truck. Furious that Maddie ghosted him, Doug drives away with her car. The property taxes on her mother's home increased with the influx of wealthy residents. Maddie bartends and drives to cover the cost but has no idea how to do it without her car.<br/><br/>Maddie meets with her pregnant friend, Sara, and Sara's husband, Jim, to brainstorm ways to get a new car. While on Craigslist, Sara spots a post from a mom and dad. Their son is going to college, and they want someone to 'date' him to make their son more social. If the woman completes the task, they will give her a Buick with 40,000 miles and a clean title.<br/><br/>Maddie rollerblades to Allison and Laird's home to discuss the arrangement. First, she assures them she is not a prostitute, just a woman who needs a car. Second, Maddie is older than the age requirement. However, she promises to handle the job with maturity and tact. They hire Maddie and request she organically meets their 19-year-old son, Percy. Percy will attend Princeton in the fall but only makes friends online. They give Maddie Percy's work schedule at the animal shelter and send her on her way. Can this Maneater help this socially awkward teen while earning a car to save her home?<br/><br/>This movie covers everything right and wrong in America while making you laugh. It opens up about gentrification, bullying, abandonment, and helicopter parents. Maddie and Percy make blunders during their meet-cute and subsequent dates. The plot doesn't rely on toilet humor to elicit laughter. It depends on throwing two different people into a normal situation with the best rendition of Maneater in a film. Percy finds his backbone during the movie while Maddie analyzes her choices. This film is a wild ride, but the ending is satisfying. A warning to parents: this movie has full-frontal nudity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ten years ago, Dominic Toretto and his team stole a vault from Hernan Reyes. Dominic thought his problems ended after Agent Luke Hobbs shot Reyes on the bridge after a destructive highway chase. However, Dominic didn't see Reyes's son, Dante, driving the car with the machine gun on the top. Dante's body flew into the river, and he survived. Dante vowed to kill Dominic, but Hernan told Dante to make Dominic suffer before he died.<br/><br/>Now, Dominic enjoys the simple life with his wife, Letty, and teaches his son, Little Brian, how to drive and fix cars. The Agency sent a new mission, and Roman took the lead. He asked Tej and Ramsey to accompany him to Rome. Dominic asks Han to go with them, just in case. Then, they get a bloody knock at the door. It's Cipher with bruises, cuts, and stab wounds. Cipher tells him that Dante took over her crew, got her technology, and left her for dead. Now, Dominic is next on Dante's list.<br/><br/>Little Nobody arrests Cipher after Dominic questions her. They catch up, and Dominic asks Little Nobody how Roman's mission is going. Little Nobody can't hide his confusion because the Agency didn't set it up. Dominic knows the mission was a ruse created by Dante. Dominic and Letty leave Brian with Mia and head to Rome. After a Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-styled bomb rolls through Rome, the Agency list Dominic and his crew, now separated, at the top of the most wanted list. Dominic has to protect his family with Dante and the Agency after him. Can Dominic save everyone?<br/><br/>The writers of Fast and the Furious understand what the critics think and make fun of themselves. Agent Aimes states that Dominic and his crew violate the laws of physics and God but somehow survive. Of course, you get mind-bending situations, crazy car stunts, and an international plot. But, there is one blaring difference with this movie: Dante. He is a flamboyant, funny, and charismatic psychopath. Dominic takes any moment to make the audience chuckle or gasp in awe. Sadly, the backing tracks and sound effects muffle a few of his quips. Unlike other Fast and The Furious movies, it doesn't end on a family barbeque. It concludes with the ultimate cliffhanger for Dominic and his family. Don't forget to stay for the mid-credit scene that gives viewers a glimpse into another spinoff.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

After Quill passes out, Nebula puts him into bed. Adam crashes into Rocket and rips through Knowhere. Adam flies away as the Guardians tend to Rocket's wounds. Quill wakes from his stooper, blames himself, and puts a medic pack on Rocket. However, it doesn't heal Rocket. It causes him to convulse. Nebula demands they take the pack off and bring Rocket to the ship.<br/><br/>Nebula links herself to Rocket's circuits and scans him. She discovers a kill switch on his heart, but they need a passkey to remove it. Nebula uncovers that Orgo Corp created the kill switch on the Orgosphere planet. Nebula knows it has a force field and calls a contact to enter the planet's atmosphere. They enter, and Quill speaks to The Ravagers because he wears their flames. However, Stakar isn't Nebula's contact; Gamora is. She is with Stakar's faction and wants 100,000 units from the Guardians to help. Nebula agrees to the terms, and the team sets on their mission to get the passkey to save Rocket's life.<br/><br/>Adam returns to his mother, Ayesha, without 89P13, and the High Evolutionary is furious. The High Evolutionary, Dr. Herbert Wyndham, reminds Ayesha of his strength because they and their birthing pods are his creation. Ayesha vows Adam will get 89P13 and ensures her promise by coming with Adam. Herbert knows exactly where 89P13 and his friends will go to save him and gives Ayesha and Adam the coordinates.<br/><br/>While in a coma, Rocket thinks about his time in a cage before Herbert started experiments on him. 89P13 was Herbert's first shining light of success. He wanted to extract Rocket's brain to study what made Rocket special. Rocket escaped, but Herbert never stopped looking for Rocket. Herbert sends Ayesha and Adam to get Rocket back but has a backup plan to guarantee he gets his ultimate prize.<br/><br/>Fans watch this ragtag bunch become a team in the first movie. In the second, diehards see them become a family. Now, prepare to watch the Guardians discover themselves. You will get eye-popping graphics, funny commentary, and assorted genres of music in this Guardians' farewell, along with a new opener dedicated to your beloved favorites.

Every Guardian gets an end to their tale, and audiences will leave the theater knowing that the Guardians will be alright. This film has mid- and post-credits scenes. And the final message will make Marvel fans smile.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

He and their parents believe the soldiers are heroes protecting the country from communism. However, Christine believes President LBJ is lying to the American people.<br/><br/>At the bar, the owner, Colonel, says he wishes he could give the Inwood guys in Vietnam a beer to show his support and lift their spirits. Chickie declares he will do it. Colonel gives Chickie a bag from the bar and fills it with beers. Chickie goes to the docks and discovers the next ship is leaving for Vietnam in 3 hours, and they need one more oiler. He grabs his bag of beers and heads to the war. He will learn about the media, politics, and the cost of war.<br/><br/>Based on The Greatest Beer Run Ever: A Memoir of Friendship, Loyalty, and War by John 'Chick' Donohue and J.T. Molloy, this movie is a comedic look at a dark moment in American history. Each time Chickie runs into a friend, they look at him with disbelief and disgust. They laugh and help Chickie along the way when he tells his growing beer run story. Chickie runs into dumb luck, but he knows it will come at a cost. Reporters challenge Chickie's ideals when he sticks up for the president. After a few nights in the trenches, his faith in the war wavers. But his love of the troops remains strong. If you have PTSD, some moments could be triggering. This beer run is epic, no matter how you feel about the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sonny Vaccaro looks through game tapes to find the next athletic sponsor for Nike. The CEO, Phil Knight, authorized $250,000 for three players. Sonny has plenty on his shoulders because Nike's basketball division is floundering. Sonny sits in a marketing meeting with its head, Rob Strasser, and looks through the 1984 NBA draft picks. Sonny wants them to consider Michael Jordan, but the staff knows Jordan is expensive and prefers Adidas. Sonny leaves the meeting upset and looks over more college basketball tapes. While watching, he sees an Arthur Ashe commercial for tennis rackets and gets an idea. Instead of having a player put on their shoes, they design them for the player. The player and the shoe will become a brand within themselves.<br/><br/>Sonny flies to LA to talk to his friend, George Raveling, because George coached Michael Jordan in the Olympic tournament. George believes Sonny's instincts are right about the rookie but warns Sonny that Michael's parents, James and Deloris, are strongholds in their son's career. Sonny returns to Nike's headquarters and pitches his idea to Howard White. Howard signed Moses Malone to a Nike deal that remains their best acquisition. Howard admits he called Moses's mom to finalize the deal. Sonny takes George and Howard's advice and meets with Jordan's parents. After a revealing conversation with Deloris, Jordan's manager, David, calls Sonny with a flurry of insults and a Monday meeting. Sonny runs to Peter Moore and asks him to design the best shoe Nike has ever created. Sonny doesn't know, but his decision to pursue Michael Jordan will change Nike, athletic sponsorships, and Michael Jordan's finances forever.<br/><br/>A lot of care went into making this film. The director ensures this isn't a Michael Jordan movie. It's about Sonny, Deloris, and Nike. Sonny is the man behind the curtain. He understood the psychology behind the sport, its players, and its coaches. However, the driving force behind this deal was Deloris Jordan. She knew her son's worth to the game and wouldn't compromise his future. The music and technology will transport you back to 1984. Also, this film gives recognition to Peter's genius. Sneakers weren't just a fashion statement for him. They were a work of art. While the language is a bit much for younger viewers, audiences will love this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Eric's advisor, Sir Grimsby, cautions Eric about carelessly putting his life on the line at sea. There are tales of the Sea King who will kill land dwellers as his daughters lore them with song. Eric is grateful that Queen Selina and the King adopted him, but he always feels out of place behind the castle walls.<br/><br/>Princess Ariel explores a shipwreck for human artifacts with her friend, Flounder. After escaping a ferocious shark, Ariel runs into her friend, Sebastian. Sebastian tells Ariel she is late for her father's meeting with her six sisters. Ariel rushes to her father, King Triton, knowing he will be upset. The king excuses her sisters and reminds Ariel not to go near savage humans. Ariel regretfully accepts the king's conditions and retreats to her hidden cave of treasures from the surface world.<br/><br/>The sailors shoot fireworks for Eric's birthday, and the lights in the sky draw Ariel to the surface. Then, a wave hits the ship and takes it down. Eric saves his men and dog but gets thrown off the other side of the boat. Ariel finds Eric and pulls him to safety. Before Eric's vision clears, Ariel swims away because Eric's people started running to him.<br/><br/>When Sebastian tells King Triton, the king goes to Ariel's cave and destroys all her trinkets. She tells her to never go to the surface again. Then, Ariel hears a voice in the distance. It's her Aunt Ursula. Ursula sees Ariel cares for Eric, but Ariel must become human to be with him. In return, Ariel will get legs. If Ariel receives true love's kiss in three days, she will remain a human forever. Otherwise, Ariel will be under Ursula's control for eternity. Ariel gets legs and swims to the surface before she drowns.<br/><br/>The people of Eric's kingdom take the mute and clumsy woman back to the castle. He sees Ariel and offers her a place to stay for as long as she wants. He doesn't recognize her and is too preoccupied with finding the woman who saved him. Ursula put a hidden clause in the agreement. Ariel would forget the kiss clause the moment she reached the surface. Now, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle must get Eric and Ariel to kiss in 3 days, or Ariel will become Ursula's minion forever.<br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of the classic Little Mermaid while making necessary changes. While Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder look more realistic, other animals have a 'Finding Nemo' feel. The musical performance has the source material's emotions, vigor, and theatrics. And the new songs blend in seamlessly with the plot. The updated storyline makes Ariel and Eric the same. They are two people looking for more in the world. However, their overprotective parents keep them behind walls because of preconceived notions about others. Don't miss Jodi Benson passing the dinglehopper to Halle Bailey. The only downside to this movie is that it is too long for children. Otherwise, this is a delightful and highly-entertaining film for the entire family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Unfortunately, the interview is over. They got word from Noah's former commanding officer. Noah is a tech whiz and a soldier but not a team player.<br/><br/>Noah returns home with Chris feeling defeated. Noah needs to make money now to help his family, so he takes a shortcut and uses his technical expertise to boost cars. He finds a beautiful Porsche and uses a Jimmy to get inside. Noah turns on the radio and hears a voice yelling for Mirage to roll out. The vehicle puts itself in gear and starts a high-speed chase. After a wild ride through the streets of New York, the car morphs into Autobot Mirage. Mirage tells Noah to be cool because the others are coming and are not fond of humans.<br/><br/>Across town, Elena interns at a museum. Her boss, Jillian, brought in a statue that she claimed to be Egyptian. But Elena thinks it's much older. Elena sees Jillian's lab tech badge and uses it to gain unauthorized access to the examination equipment. As she scans the item, it breaks apart and reveals something inside. She doesn't see a stream of light emanating from it, but Optimus Prime does.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is in awe of the light. He knows it comes from the Transwarp Key. The key opens portals through time and space. Optimus can use it to send himself and the Autobots to their home world, Cybertron. He calls the Autobots - Bumblebee, Mirage, and Acree - to plan a way into the museum. The Autobots catch Noah trying to sneak out as they discuss ways to retrieve the key. Mirage gets an idea. They can have Noah get the key for them. Optimus isn't keen on the idea, but he knows Scourge can see the beacon too.<br/><br/>Scourge leads the Terrorcons and works for Unicron. Unicron fuels himself by eating planets. Unicron sent Scourge to find the key to become unstoppable. The last time Scourge saw the key was on the homeworld of the Maximals. Their leader, Apelinq, sacrificed himself so the Maximals, including Optimus Primal, could escape with their greatest technology: the Transwarp key. Optimus knows it's a matter of time before Scourge comes to Earth looking for it.<br/><br/>Noah enters the museum, and Elena confronts him. The Terrorcons shoot a hole in the museum as they argue over the artifact. After battling on the museum's front lawn, Scourge destroys Bumblebee's spark and leaves with the key. However, they only got half the key. She believes the other half of the key is in Peru. Elena, Noah, and the Autobots head to Peru, with Scourge not far behind. Who will win the battle of the key?<br/><br/>Inspired by Transformers, this movie takes place after Bumblebee but serves as a prequel to the Transformers movie series. The intro gives the audience a glimpse of the Maximals and their mission before coming to Earth. However, the plot assumes you know the story of the Transformers. While Mirage delivers comic relief, the storyline focuses on brotherly relationships. The animation is crisp and not offputting. Luckily, the writers didn't add an unnecessary romance. Be prepared for a surprise in the final scene that will push this franchise into the future. Also, there is one mid-credit scene. This film is as enjoyable as Bumblebee but doesn't drag like the other Transformers films. It is a rejuvenated addition to the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist Jürgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half.

They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Barbie lives in her dreamhouse. She takes a waterless shower, eats her perfect pretend breakfast, and floats to her car. Barbie goes to the beach to relax, and Ken waits for Barbie to notice him. Ken asks to visit Barbie's house, and she invites him to her blowout party with choreography.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Barbie's party until Barbie asks them if they think about death. She laughs it off and continues dancing. In the morning, Barbie wakes up tired, her waterless shower is cold, and the pretend breakfast isn't edible. Barbie confesses that something is wrong, and the other Barbies tell her to go to Weird Barbie.<br/><br/>Barbie goes to Weird Barbie and tells her everything that happened. Barbie's little girl in the real world is sad, and it affects how she plays with Barbie. Barbie doesn't understand how this could happen because playing with Barbie made the lives of real girls perfect like her. Barbie heads to the real world with Ken stowing away in the backseat. She will find her girl, help her, and return to Barbieland with her body and mind in tack. However, the real world will change Barbieland in ways Barbie never dreamed, but Ken always imagined.<br/><br/>This movie starts with all the pink, butterflies, and glitter you expect from Barbie. It has all the Barbies you remember as a little child, even discontinued Barbies like Midge, Growing Up Skipper, and TV Barbie. When she enters the real world, she sees it isn't perfect. And little girls aren't thanking her for making a difference. Ken sees the human world and loves it. Men are working, driving big cars, and focusing on each other. The real world has a lasting effect on both of them.<br/><br/>As the trailer says, this film is for people who love and hate Barbie because it focuses on Barbie's issues while addressing her contributions. During the trip to Barbie, Barbie talks to her owner, Sasha, and Sasha's mother, Gloria. Gloria gives a speech to Barbie, who is having an existential crisis, and it will make you sigh with understanding and exhaustion. You leave this film with your eyes open, your feelings heard, and loving Barbie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Oppenheimer",
    "review":"J. Robert Oppenheimer sits in front of a security hearing board because he wants to maintain his security clearance. He recounts his life before and during his government work under scads scrutiny. He teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and dedicates time to the California Institute of Technology. Oppenheimer crosses paths with Ernest Lawrence, Jean Tatlock, and his future wife, Katherine Puening.<br/><br/>General Leslie Groves seeks out Oppenheimer to work on the Manhattan Project but worries Oppenheimer's communist ties will delay his clearance. Oppenheimer assures Groves that he only has an academic interest in the party, not a devotion. Oppenheimer wasn't sure about creating the Atomic Bomb but wanted to end World War II. So he agreed to do it because the only scientist in Germany with Oppenheimer's knowledge was Jewish. They know Hitler won't give him funding.<br/><br/>Oppenheimer convinces Groves to create a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with places to pray, shop, and attend school. Oppenheimer and his researchers work before the town is complete, and William L. Borden enters with startling calculations. His math proves the Atomic Bomb could cause an explosion in the atmosphere and create a chain reaction that destroys the world. Oppenheimer asks Lewis Strauss to introduce him to Albert Einstein. He gives Albert the calculations, and Albert confirms them. Oppenheimer must continue his work with the constant threat of annihilation hanging over his head. And he will bring death to thousands if it works as expected. Can Oppenheimer accept the applause and responsibility of being a modern-day Prometheus?<br/><br/>The director made this movie with extreme precision for the period, the scientists, and their struggles. If you pay close attention, this historical film has the drama of a daytime soap opera. This movie follows Oppenheimer's life before, during, and after the Atomic Bomb. It acknowledges his flaws and brilliance throughout his career. Also, it addresses some controversies and conspiracies that surrounded him. This battle is compelling because it's between two competitive, intelligent, and petty men. This movie covers ample history, but it's not for children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Days ago, Ethan got a message to find his ally Ilsa Faust and obtain the missing half of a cruciform key. After giving Ethan his instructions, Eugene Kittridge loses contact with Ethan. Kittridge sits in a classified meeting with Director Denlinger and his advisors and reveals information about Impossible Mission Force. Kittridge explains that experimental Artificial Intelligence meant to hack digital information went rogue and became self-aware and self-learning. They call it the Entity, the biggest threat to the world. They need Ethan to destroy it because other world powers know about the Entity and seek to harness it for global domination. Ethan must remain resilient against his past to secure the world's future. But can Ethan risk the ones he loves?<br/><br/>Based on the TV series, this Mission Impossible installment is the seventh in the franchise and lives up to the crazy stunts and spine-tingling drama of the previous six. The writers inject the right amount of humor at the most opportune moments. New fans don't need to see the previous movies to understand this film. The plot sticks to AI and Machine Learning fears in other films, but the action sets it apart. There are zero mid-credit or post-credit scenes. And yes, it ends on the perfect cliffhanger. Fans of the franchise won't be disappointed and will look forward to part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
