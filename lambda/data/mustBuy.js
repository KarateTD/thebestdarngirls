    "mtitle":"Minions: The Rise of Gru",
    "review":"It's career day in 1976, and while some kids dream of being doctors and lawyers, Gru dreams of joining The Vicious Six and becoming a super villain. The Vicious Six members are Belle Bottom, Jean Clawed, Nunchuck, Svengence, and Stronghold, and their leader is Wild Knuckles, Gru's hero. The Vicious Six accepted his application and wants Gru to interview for a spot on their team at Criminal Records tomorrow.<br/><br/>Gru doesn't know that The Vicious Six is looking for a new member because they turned on Wild Knuckles during their last heist. Wild Knuckles risked his life inside a temple to get the stone. The stone will give someone the power of a Chinese zodiac animal on the Chinese New Year. Instead of saving him, Belle Bottom grabs the stone and pushes Wild Knuckles off the plane. With Wild Knuckles dead, they need a new member to complete their team and use the stone to destroy the Anti-Villain League.<br/><br/>In the interview, Gru tells The Vicious Six that he is despicable and ready to join. Awestruck by Gru's age, they tell Gru no and to go to school. During another interviewee's questions, Gru sneaks around The Vicious Six and gets the stone. With The Vicious Six on his tail, Gru gives the stone to his minion, Otto, to take to their lair. They get away and meet with Otto at the hideout. Gru plans to return the stone to The Vicious Six, so they will accept him. Gru asks Otto for the stone, and Otto gives Gru a pet rock. On the way, Otto saw a birthday party, and the birthday boy got a pet rock. Otto fell in love with it and traded it for the stone. Gru walks out to find it, and Kevin sees someone kidnap Gru.<br/><br/>The kidnappers let Gru out of the bag, and Gru sees Wild Knuckles in front of him. Surprised to see Wild Knuckles alive, Gru hands him the pet rock instead of the stone. Wild Knuckles hangs Gru off a balcony and makes a ransom call to the minions. The Vicious Six still think Gru has the stone. Can the Minions save Gru and get the stone?<br/><br/>This movie has something for the entire family, from the opening credits to the mid-credits scene. The soundtrack will have you dancing in your seat with 70's funk, rock, and disco. The storyline is complex but not entirely original. Although the minions don't articulate well, the animators gave them spot-on non-verbal communication. The plot provides a training montage with Master Chow for an easy but fulfilling laugh. See this one in theaters, but 3D isn't necessary.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Doctor Strange and America Chavez run towards the Book of Vishanti with a demon chasing them.  Doctor Strange realizes the demon is too strong to stop.  There is only one way to win and save the multiverse, kill America.  Then, he wakes up in bed.  Doctor Strange is accustomed to these nightmares and brushes them off.  Today, Christine will marry Charles.<br/><br/>At the reception, Dr. Strange hears car crashes and people screaming.  He looks outside to see cars slamming by themselves.  He uses a spell to reveal a monster chasing a girl.  After Doctor Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong save the girl, Doctor Strange remembers her from his dream.  America swipes his sling ring and runs away.  Strange and Wong catch up to her, get the sling ring, and ask why the monster came after her.  She explains a demon desires to steal her power because she has the ability to jump through universes. Doctor Strange's dreams weren't dreams.  However, they were connections to the other Doctor Stranges in different universes.  Wong remembers markings on the monster, but they didn't look like any ruins they know.  They looked like witchcraft.  Doctor Strange decides to consult the strongest witch he knows: Wanda.<br/><br/>As Strange discusses the multiverse with Wanda, she says America's name.  Strange freezes because he never said it.  Wanda sent the creatures after America.  Wanda acquired the Darkhold and used it to move between universes to steal America's powers.  Once she has America's abilities, she can be in another universe with Billy and Tommy forever.  She gives Doctor Strange until sundown to bring America to her, or Scarlet Witch will come for them.<br/><br/>This movie kicks down any preconceived notions about the movie or the multiverse.  Before watching this film, you should watch What If, WandaVision, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange.  While you won't get that awe-inspiring, stand up and cheer moment fans get with the other movies, you have a good time. You should know this is one of the most ruthless and bloody films in the MCU.  The graphics are stunning and look better in 3D.  And there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Evelyn prepares the paperwork for their upcoming audit.  Her focus pulls her attention away from her husband, Waymond, when he tries to hand her divorce papers.  Her daughter, Joy, waits for Evelyn with Joy's girlfriend, Becky.  Evelyn brushes off Joy and concentrates on work.<br/><br/>Evelyn grabs her paperwork and goes to the IRS headquarters with Waymond and her father, Gong Gong.  As they ride the elevator up, Waymond deploys an umbrella to block the camera, grabs two earbuds, and puts them in Evelyn's ears.  He tells Evelyn that he is Waymond from another universe, and he needs her help.  If she wants to see him again, follow the instructions on the paper.<br/><br/>While talking with the IRS inspector, Deirdre, Evelyn looks at the paper.  It gives Evelyn 3 steps that land her in the janitor's closet with the other Waymond.  He tells her that the multiverse exists.  When another Evelyn discovered you could connect to another version of yourself, they used the power to gain skills.  But Jobu Tupaki wants to use this ability to destroy all the universes.  So, she is going through each one and killing Evelyns.  Waymond wants this universe's Evelyn to tap into the other Evelyns and defeat Jobu.  Then, Waymond and Deidre start fighting.  Within minutes, Evelyn has to learn how to tap into the multiverse, use her powers, and fight Jobu.  When she is face-to-face with her universe's Jobu, can Evelyn kill Jobu?<br/><br/>This film mixes the lessons of generational pain with some of the most hilarious, painful, and outrageous fight scenes ever crafted.  To tap into another universe's skills, they have to stimulate themselves. And it gets wild with fanny packs, awards, and dogs.  This 3-part film slows down towards the end and loses the audience for a while.  Be ready for a visual feast.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gorr walks the deserts of his land with his daughter. He prays for his God to bring food and water for his child, but she dies in his arms. As he weeps on her grave, an oasis appears. Gorr asks his God why he didn't assist him and his daughter. His God admits he didn't care and can find new followers. Gorr renounces his God and then summons the killer's weapon, Necrosword, to him and slays the God. He vows to become the new God Killer and murder every God and their followers.<br/><br/>After defeating Thanos and his army, Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to defend the universe. The battles are simple for this God of Thunder. After Thor finishes another battle leaving the Guardians useless, they looked for more distressed planets. And Thor spots Sif. Thor and Korg go to Sif and find her injured on the battlefield. She warns Thor that Asgard is Gorr's next stop. Thor, Korg, and Sif head to Asgard.<br/><br/>Dr. Jane Foster wrote a book and is a leader in her field, but she spends more time researching her stage 4 cancer than the stars. Then, Jane hears Mjolnir calling her name. She travels to Asgard, a vacation destination, and searches for the shattered pieces of Mjolnir. In Asgard, King Valkyrie spends more time on politics than battle.<br/><br/>Thor, Korg, and Sif return to Asgard and discover it under attack. Gorr summoned shadow monsters to attack the Asgardians. Thor grabs Stormbreaker for battle but sees a familiar object ripping through creatures. It's Mjolnir. Thor calls the hammer towards him, but it's under the control of someone else: Jane, The Mighty Thor. However, they don't notice other shadow monsters stealing the Asgard children until it's too late.<br/><br/>As Valkyrie, Jane, and Thor create a plan to rescue the kids, Axl, Heimdall's son, connects to Thor using his inherited gifts. Through Axl's eyes, Thor can see the children inside a Shadow Realm cave. Valkyrie and Thor exchange a look. They know the best place to summon a God's army is Omnipotent City and then asking Zeus. They can rescue the Asgardian children and defeat Gorr with Zeus's army. Thor doesn't understand that fighting a war is easy, but battling for love will kill.<br/><br/>During the opening credits, viewers get a glimpse into the battles of the Asgardians of the Galaxy. This film adds insight into the past while giving hints to the overarching antagonist of these MCU phases. So keep your eyes open. Let's not forget that the script introduces us to more Young Avengers. The movie is off-the-charts with well-crafted CGI and flawless fight choreography. During the Shadow Realm fight scene, the contrast of the black and white world with the color from the clashing weapons is worth the 3D price. Unlike other Thor movies, this film gives the characters a satisfying and heart-warming conclusion. And stick around for two post-credit scenes that offer a new villain and a new life.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The ship, also known as the turnip, wakes up Buzz from hypersleep. The ship's sensors detected life on the planet nearby. Buzz wakes Commander Hawthorne to take a closer look at the planet's inhabitants and collect soil samples. They make it back to the ship and try to fly away, but Buzz crashes and cracks their fuel cell, and they don't have another. Til they can create another fuel cell that can get them into hyperspace, the crew can't leave the planet.<br/><br/>The crew created a colony and a new fuel cell within a year, and Buzz boards XL-1 for a four-minute test flight around the sun and back. Buzz gets 60% into hyperspace before the fuel cell dies, and he lands. The trip lasted 4 minutes for Buzz, but it's four years for the colony. To help Buzz acclimate, Hawthorne gives Buzz a robotic therapy cat, Sox. Sox worries about Buzz, but Buzz tells the cat to help by fixing the fuel. Sox says ok.<br/><br/>Fifteen missions later, Buzz comes home to find that Hawthorne died. She left a video message for Buzz with her granddaughter, Izzy, sweetly interrupting. Commander Burnside walks into Hawthorne's old barracks and tells a weeping Buzz that the fuel mission is over. The colony decided to end the space ranger program, stay on the planet, take Sox, and create a laser dome to keep out the planet's dangerous inhabitants. Buzz tells Sox the mission is over, and Sox is disappointed because he figured out the formula. So Buzz grabs Sox, creates the fuel cell, and steals a ship. Buzz and Sox accomplish their mission and land on the planet but can't land on the colony because of the laser dome. Buzz finds the safest landing spot, and someone in a suit approaches him and tells Buzz to be quiet. The person in the suit sees Buzz's name tag and tells him that her name is Izzy, Hawthorne's granddaughter. It's been 22 years since Buzz left.<br/><br/>Since then, an enemy spacecraft came to the planet with a legion of robots. Their commander is the evil Emperor Zurg. After Zurg arrived, his army waged a constant attack on the laser dome. Izzy remembers the stories about Buzz and knows he is the missing link to Operation Surprise Party. They will take out the mothership controlling the robots to save the colony. But they need Buzz to get them to Zurg's spacecraft. Buzz respects Izzy's lineage, but he doesn't work with rookies. While Buzz doesn't want their help, he will need it to save the colony, defeat Zurg, and redefine his mission.<br/><br/>In 1995, Andy got a toy inspired by his favorite movie. Lightyear is the movie. So this adaptation isn't a remake or a sequel; it's a prequel for Andy's world in Toy Story 1. Pixar animators did a stunning job creating a colonized world on a dangerous planet. And their space animation is second to none. While creating a world of space travel, animators included geometry. Yes, Buzz is a mathlete. And let's not forget the quiet love letter Pixar sent to classic Nintendo fans. While this is an animation, the complex storyline is for 1995 Toy Story fans, not their kids. However, its action and jokes will entertain parents and their children.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"On October 30th, 1969, in Barkley Cove, North Carolina, two boys riding their bikes along the marsh find Chase Andrews's body. They determine that Chase fell from the fire tower. They find red fiber on Chase and have a lab examine it.<br/><br/>The officers go to the bar, and everyone talks about the case. Tom, a retired lawyer, overhears the whispered commotion. There were rumors that Chase was secretly dating the 'Marsh Girl' and someone heard her threaten him.<br/><br/>The police go to see the Marsh Girl the next day. They look through the girl's things and unearth a red hat. They take her to jail while the town hurls insults. When the lab determines the hat matches the fibers found on Chase, they charge the Marsh Girl with murder.<br/><br/>Tom walks into the jail cell and introduces himself to the Marsh Girl. But he knows her as Catherine Danielle Clark, but her family calls her Kya. Kya resided alone on the marsh since she was a child. Her mother, Ma, left Kya and Kya's siblings with their abusive alcoholic father, Pa. Kya, a child then, decided to stay with him and be invisible. Tom offers to represent Kya in the murder trial but pleads for Kya to open up to him. Tom knows that the jury will use their preconceived notions against her. Tom needs to prove Kya's innocence and place in society. Or she will get the death penalty.<br/><br/>Based on Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, be ready to feel the words jump off the page. The director used the marsh, lagoon, and swamp to narrate pages of complex land descriptions. At first, the swamp looks daunting and frightening. As Kya grows into a young woman, the swamp is inviting, loving, and full of life. The mystery unfolds with flashbacks and courtroom questioning. At times, these two intertwining storylines conflict or compliment each other. It's a mystery that waits for the last 15 seconds to give you the killer and the reason.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

It's a small town called Kakamucho, protected by a samurai. When the samurai sees the mass amount of cat warriors heading to the town, the samurai runs away, leaving Kakamucho defenseless.<br/><br/>The citizens of Kakamucho demand the Shogun send a new samurai, and the Shogun delegates the job to Ika Chu. He sees a dog, Hank, facing execution for walking into cat territory. Hank admits to crossing the border only to receive samurai training. Ika Chu appoints Hank the new samurai because he knows the cats of Kakamucho will kill a dog on sight.<br/><br/>Ika Chu's prediction is correct, and the cats attack Hank. But they stop when Hank proves he is the new samurai. Hank meets Jimbo, a hesitant sensei with too much catnip, and convinces Jimbo to train him. Ika Chu can't fathom the cats accepting this dog, so he vows to destroy Hank and Kakamucho before Shogun arrives.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Blazing Saddles, this movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, the characters never forget it's a movie. It takes everyday activities, like tweeting, and transforms the tweet into an actual bird. This film is an animated, classic comedy you grew up watching. It's worth every penny, and you will enjoy it more than your children.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Yuichi found a note. The note states that Wataru's attacker will be on the bullet train headed to Kyoto in seat B4. As he approaches B4 with a gun, Yuichi finds a young girl sitting there. He apologizes, and she stuns him. The young girl is known as The Prince and wants to use Yuichi to set up her target, The White Death.<br/><br/>Maria's called her best snatch-and-grab man, Ladybug, for a job after The Carver fell ill. After some time with his therapist, Barry, Ladybug is ready to return to work. Maria wants Ladybug to board the bullet train and find a silver briefcase with train stickers and get off at the next stop.<br/><br/>Lemon and Tangerine are twin brothers working for The White Death. The White Death's enemies kidnapped his son, The Son, and held him for ransom. Lemon and Tangerine faked a ransom drop, killed the kidnappers, and got The Son. They will ride the bullet train and return The Son and the briefcase of money to The White Death.<br/><br/>A mobster raised The Wolf after The Wolf's mother died. Now, The Wolf is a contract killer for the mob boss. Years later, The Wolf marries his girlfriend in a white tuxedo with the mob in attendance. The Wolf raised his glass of red wine just as a waiter bumped him, spilling wine on The Wolf's tux. The Wolf left to clean his suit and got a bloody shock.

However, they will collide with a Fiji bottle, a barrette, a sticker, and one unfortunate incident. Oh, and there is a venomous snake loose on the train.<br/><br/>If you miss one second, go home. Based on Bullet Train by Kōtarō Isaka, this movie has surprises throughout the plot that will make you gasp, laugh, and scream. Between Ladybug's therapy wisdom and Lemon's Thomas the Tank Engine obsession, the audience will find quick laughs between the bloodshed. While the story isn't linear, the director placed the flashbacks in the right place to move the story forward. There is one mid-credit scene that will bring you to a visual zen. If you love Ambulance's action, John Wick's humor, and Death on the Nile's mystery, this is the right movie for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Lois feels that Krypto is lonely, so she suggests Superman go to the pet store and get Krypto a friend.<br/><br/>When Superman walks in, the proprietor notices one dog, Ace, escaped.

It's a guinea pig named Lulu. She shoots Superman with Kryptonite and throws him out the window. Lulu hid kryptonite in a piece of cheese that Krypto ate, so now he is defenseless. Then, Krypto recognizes Lulu.<br/><br/>Lulu was a guinea pig in Lex Luthor's lab. And as he experimented, she watched and learned. Lex studied different types of kryptonite and discovered the orange one could give him powers. Before Lex could test his theory, Superman and Krypto stopped him and freed all the guinea pigs, putting Lulu in a pet shop with Ace. However, Lulu didn't want Krypto to save her. When orange kryptonite came into orbit, Lex grabbed it, but the Justice League stopped Lex from obtaining it. It gave Lulu the power to move things with her mind. So she went to Superman's house to start step one of her plan.<br/><br/>Krypto wonders aimlessly and without powers until she sees lightning shooting from the ground to the sky. He finds Ace, PB, Merton, and Chip. Lulu didn't know, but they all got powers from the shard. Krypto thinks they should work together to stop Lulu before she destroys Superman and the world.<br/><br/>Adults, don't be surprised if you laugh more than your children at this film. The jokes aren't sexual innuendoes, so don't worry about that. This movie, based on the DC Legion of Super-Pets: The Great Mxy-UP, has the dark humor of a DC comic movie wrapped in adorable pets. The film will strike a chord with pet owners while raising awareness about pet adoption, especially the older pets. The plot is a bit of Snyder's Cut mixed with The Secret Life of Pets. Be prepared to laugh while your kids punch in the air. And there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Rosa looks at her bank manager, Estel, with unbridled panic and fear in her eyes. They offer to give him money, but that's not what Brian wants. He wants Rosa and Estel to get news reporters and police on the scene. For months, Brian felt ignored and unheard. The VA and Lincoln College of Technology stole his money, and he wants the VA to pay it back.<br/><br/>Based on 'They Didn't Have to Kill Him': The Death of Lance Cpl. Brian Easley by Aaron Gell, this movie covers many topics plaguing US veterans, including homelessness, PTSD, job insecurity, and the VA.. It's painful to watch this kind man fight for the little money he had. For the soldiers that give everything for the US, it's disgusting that they have to jump through hoops to get anything back.
