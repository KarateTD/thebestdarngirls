Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.<br/><br/>This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She unintentionally blows up a DEA safe house.  In an attempt to get help, she runs to the DEA.  But, they threaten her too.  They want her to go back to Lino and plant a tracker on him.  Or they will charge her with the murder of DEA agents.  So, Gloria is risking life or jail to find Suzu.<br/><br/>This movie is 15 minutes of set up and the rest all action.  Once it gets going, it never stops.  And it has more twist and turns than a soap opera.  See it today and hope for a part 2.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vers is excited to be granted her first mission by the Supreme Intelligence.  During the battle between the Kree and the Skrulls, Vers is captured and put into a mind hacking machine.  The Skrulls uncover memories she thought were dreams.  She escapes the machine and jumps into an escape pod that veers off course to C-53, a.k.a. Earth.  On earth, Vers will learn the truth about her powers, the Kree, and the Skrulls.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the MCU need to watch the other films before watching this movie.  There are a lot of jokes and references to the past and present that will not make sense without knowledge of these movies.  With so much history to cover before the initial story, the first 10 minutes feels extremely rushed.  If you miss it, you will miss everything.  And 90s babies, be ready for some nostalgia.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

As she prays for God to save her son, his heart starts beating again.  She will need her faith, her family, and her pastor to get her through as she prays for her son.<br/><br/>This movie will have you in tears.

Aladdin is saved and his monkey, Abu, unknowingly steals the lamp from Jafar before the fall.  Trapped inside the Cave of Wonders, Aladdin rubs the lap and releases a Genie.  The Genie offers him 3 wishes.  He wants the Genie to help him be a prince to get the woman of his dreams, Princess Jasmine.  Only Jafar and his ambition to become Sultan stand in Aladdin's way.<br/><br/>This live adaption of the animated movie pays the highest respect to he original material. It doesn't change the story but adds to it.  It gives Princess Jasmine a song and a big dance.  The Genie keeps his comedic appearance while Iago and Abu are the best right-hand men.  The CGI was great for everyone but Genie.  At times, the head moved independently from it's CGI body and it was very distracting.  Because of this, 3D is a bad idea for this movie.  However, it is great for the whole family and you will feel an urge to see the play.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
