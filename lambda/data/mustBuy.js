    "review":"Hutch Mansell is a married father of two.  One night, Hutch couldn't sleep and checked on his children when he heard a noise downstairs.  It is a man and a woman in ski masks attempting to rob his home.  The woman holds the gun at Hutch's head and demands his money, and Hutch points to a bowl on the counter. Then, Hutch's son, Blake, tackles the man.  The woman turns around and points the gun at Blake.  Hutch grabs a nearby golf club, but he doesn't hit the woman. The man and woman leave but not before punching Blake in the face. Hutch could see that the woman's gun wasn't loaded, so they didn't pose a threat.  At home, Hutch continues, but his daughter, Abby, can't find her kitty kat bracelet.  She left it in the bowl with all the money.  So, Hutch grabs his bus pass and leaves his home. It's not long before he finds Lupita and Luis and tells them he wants the bracelet.  Lupita gives him the watch, but she swears they don't have the bracelet. Hutch leaves and gets on the bus.  After he closes his eyes, the bus comes to a hard stop after the driver witnesses an accident.  The drunk drivers leave their stalled car and board the bus.  This moment was the opportunity Hutch needed all night because it awakens his beast, and Hutch leaves a pile of broken bodies on the bus.  But one of the men, Teddy, is related to Yulian Kuznetsov. Yulian wants revenge for the man that attacked his brother.  But he should be careful because Hutch is a Nobody.<br/><br/>So imagine mixing John Wick's action, Guardians of the Galaxy's music arrangement, and Kill Bill's wit, and you have Nobody.  With bone-crushing and bloody action, this movie proves the mild-mannered man is something to be feared.  As his victims slowly die, Hutch explains who he was, who he became, and why his life changed.  Unlike John Wick, Hutch is a family man with a father in a nursing home. This movie will be a favorite for action enthusiasts.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Godzilla vs. Kong",
    "review":"It's been years since Kong defeated King Ghidorah, and now Kong continues his life on Skull Island. Monarch, with Dr. Ilene's guidance, monitors Kong's movements, diet, and attitude.  Also, Dr. Ilene cares for a little girl named Jia.  Jia is the last surviving member of the Iwa tribe. Others warn Ilene that Kong has outgrown the enclosure.  They need to move him, or they won't be able to contain him.  Ilene worries that moving Kong will awaken Godzilla.  In Pensacola, Florida, Apex Cybernetics has a mole with a Titan Conspiracy podcast named Bernie.  He downloads files and uses them to expose the work at Apex. As he delves deeper into the files, Godzilla attacks the Apex compound. Outside, no one understands why Godzilla is attacking Apex.  In the past, Godzilla only attacks when provoked. Madison listens to Bernie's latest broadcast about the attack and runs to her father, Mark Russell, who lost his wife, Emma, in the previous Monarch attack.  Madison tells Mark about the podcast and Godzilla's history, but he doesn't listen.  Madison decides to find Bernie to track Godzilla's reason for attacking Apex.  But Apex's CEO, Walter Simmons, doesn't want to know why; he wants to stop Godzilla.  He goes to Dr. Nathan and requests his help.  Walter wants Nathan to go to Hollow Earth, the Titan's home. Walter created the Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle or HEAV for short, and it can withstand the reverse-gravitational effect.  And to find the Titan's source of power, they will need a titan, Kong.  With Kong as a divining rod, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan will travel to Hollow Earth to save the world from Godzilla.  But Bernie, Madison, and Madison's friend, Josh, discover that Godzilla isn't the biggest dog in the yard.  Who will come out on top?<br/><br/>Talk about a movie that gets to the point.  You came to see two titans fight, and you won't be waiting for long.  First, they battle at sea, then on land. With so much focus on the titans, the humans were subplots and obstacles for the hero to overcome. The graphics become cartoonish when the titans are on screen alone.  But when they interact with each other or humans, the CGI gets better.  See this movie on the tallest screen possible, whether that's in a theater or at home, and don't stay past the end credits.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

And if Greville wanted to give his family a fighting chance to survive a Cold War, he will continue to courier Oleg's information.  Oleg and Greville's partnership leaves a lasting impact on the world we live in today.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe Oleg and Greville's impact on the world then, the world today, and the world to come. These family men form an unbreakable bond and save the world.  They dodge the KGB, death threats, and poisonings to stand up for the world they want for their children. The acting, costumes, hair, and make-up were flawless.  The movie's pace slowed down as the script delved into their private lives, but delving allowed the viewer to see Oleg's and Greville's unique motivation for spying and treason.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney Raya and the Last Dragon",
		"review":"Raya passed her final test, and she is the next protector of the orb.  Five hundred years ago, dragons protected Kumandra from evil spirits.  But the Druun was too powerful, so the dragons put all their powers into one orb, and the last dragon, Sisu, fought the Druun and merged her spirit into the orb.  The people of Kumandra battled over the orb, and the fight led Kumandra to divide into factions: Heart, Talon, Spine, Tail, and Fang.  The Heart faction, which Raya and her father, Chief Benji, belong to, possess the orb. At the gathering, Raya meets Namaari, the daughter of Chieftess Virana of Fang.  Both girls love the tale of the dragons, and Namaari gives Raya a necklace of Sisu.  Enamored by this gift, Raya takes Namaari to the orb, but Namaari attempts to steal it. The orb breaks, the Druun return, and each faction take a piece of the orb. Before the Druun turns him into stone, Benji throws Raya off the bridge and into the water below. It's been six years since the Druun returned, and Raya still searches for Sisu. Of course, Raya isn't the only person looking for Sisu; Namaari is too.  After performing a ritual, Raya wakens Sisu, and Sisu wants to see her brothers and sisters.  Raya tells Sisu that the Druun turned her fellow dragons into stone. Sisu and Raya want to put the orb and Kumandra back together, but she and Raya will face old enemies along the way: greed and mistrust.<br/><br/>With a lesson needed in today's society, Raya fits perfectly into the Disney franchise.  With elaborate settings and dazzling fight scenes, Raya and her flaws draw you into the plot.  But it's Sisu that keeps you watching.  This lovable dragon gains the powers of her siblings while maintaining her caring and trusting nature. With all this sentiment, the plot provides an abundance of laughs.  From a con baby to a little Forrest Gump, each character will connect.  Whether you see it on the big screen or watch it on Disney+ Premier Access, you will be an instant fan.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

The four men decided to meet at Malcolm's hotel room later that night.  Sam arrives first and notices that two bodyguards protect Malcolm's dump of a hotel room. As he plays, Cassius, Malcolm, and Jim arrive together and exchange warm greetings with Sam.  Sam, Cassius, and Jim are ready to paint Miami red to celebrate the new champ.  But Malcolm warns Cassius about temptation.  For some time, Cassius sought Malcolm's religious counsel before his fight, decided to convert to Muslim and join the Nation of Islam. Malcolm works with Alex Haley to pen his autobiography because Malcolm can feel death knocking at his door.  While holding the record for most running yards in a season, Jim Brown feels respected on the field, but not off it. As they sit in the hotel room trying to convince Malcolm to party, the men will scold each other's motives, interrogate their role in the black community, and question their future.  After this one night, each man's life will change forever.<br/><br/>Based on the One Night in Miami play, this provocative tale, inspired by real-life events, will leave you awestruck with brilliant performances.  The conversations between these men are poignant, striking, provoking, and critical for their advancement. But after one night together, these in-depth and controversial conversations inspire change in each man.  Whether it's a song, a name, a job, or a book, the world will grow from it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1968 Chicago, Bill O'Neal stands outside Leon's bar and notices a cherry red GTO.  He goes inside, flashes an FBI badge, and starts body-searching the patrons.  When he finds the keys inside a man's pocket, Bill arrests the man for grand theft auto.  Another man looks Bill in the eye and recognizes him.  He knows Bill is a con-artist, not FBI.  Bill grabs the keys, jumps in the car, locks the doors, and drives off as the patrons try to stop him.  Later, the police catch Bill in the stolen car.  They arrest Bill and put him in a room for questioning.  FBI Special Agent Roy Mitchell tells Bill he will do 18 months for the robbery and five years for impersonating an FBI agent.  Or he can pick another option. Mitchell offers to drop Bill's charges if he becomes an FBI informant to gather intel on Frederick Hampton.  Fred is the chairman of the Black Panther Party of Chicago.  Under constant threat of arrest, Bill is the lynchpin to one of the darkest days in FBI, Black Panther organization, and American history.<br/><br/>While the title seems extreme, the story of Bill and Fred mirror that of Judas and Jesus.  Bill pretended to be a friend, traded information for money and died like Judas. You will notice that when Bill is the focal point, the camera follows behind him. When he is with others, the camera is always in front or on the side of him.  This change in camera angle helps the viewer change perspective mentally and visually.  The music, setting, makeup, technology, and clothing were in line with the period.  This movie and its dismal conclusion for everyone involved will stick with you.  Not only will you watch again, but you will also start researching the names that history tries to forget.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

So you need to be at the theater and in your seat from beginning to end.  In four chapters, this movie peels itself like an onion. The heist, with the mastermind narrating the plan as you see it take place, is perfection.  With this narration, you will hear what should happen and what went wrong.  Don't be shocked if inappropriate moments make you laugh. This movie will be an easy favorite for the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
