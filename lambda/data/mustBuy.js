    "review":"While running from war with triplets, Pedro stopped, kissed his wife, Alma, and headed towards the soldiers.  He sacrificed himself for his family.  Alma fell to the ground in tears.  Then her candle started to glow, and mountains grew around her.  And from nowhere, a house, Casita, formed out of thin air with magic.  However, it wasn't the only magical entity.  When each family member came of age, they would touch the candle, and their door would reveal their gift.  Mirabel is a decedant of one of the triplets.  Unlike her family, she did not get a gift.  Now, the townspeople and the family worry that the same thing will happen to Mirabel's cousin, Antonio.  The entire community watches the ceremony, but Antonio wants Mirabel by his side.  Antonio touches the door and gets the ability to talk to animals.  The town celebrates, and Mirabel walks around thinking about her purpose.  Then she sees the house starting to crack, and the candle's flame almost extinguished.  Mirabel runs to tell the family, but they see nothing and blame it on jealousy.  After talking to several family members, she learns that her estranged uncle Bruno, gifted with premonitions, had a vision of the family losing the magic but never finished his vision.  Mirabel decides to go through Bruno's door and complete his premonition to save her Casita, her family, and the entire town.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't just point out Mirabel's struggles; it allows her and the audience to see that each of her family members has their struggles too. If you ever feel unimportant or under immense pressure, this movie will speak to you and bring a tear to your eye.  With stunning visual effects, this film will engross your whole family.  And be prepared to dance in your seat.  Be aware this movie isn't about good guys versus bad guys.  It's about the struggle we all face within.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"While Venus and Serena Williams study and practice, their father, Richard, passes out brochures to everyone at the local country club.  Before Venus and Serena's birth, Richard wrote a detailed plan for their tennis career.  While he believes in his daughters, Richard can't get someone to coach the girls for free.  With his brochure getting little traction, Richard packs up Venus and Serena and drives them to see Paul Cohen.  Richard talks Paul into watching the girls hit a few balls, and Paul is impressed.  But he tells Richard that he can only coach Venus for the junior tournaments.  This moment is the first time something hasn't gone according to the plan.  Now, Richard has to make a lasting decision that will affect Venus and Serena's lives forever.  Heavy is the head that wears the crown.<br/><br/>King Richard tells the story of a complicated man in a battle with himself and the world for what he pre-ordained.  At the moment, it's hard to understand if Richard is doing this for pride or love.  Often, Brandy calls him out on his pride privately.  Although he is instrumental in the girls' success, as Richard steps back, the girls fly.  Sit back and watch history in the making.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tony Lawrence heard about the upcoming Woodstock festival but realized it was missing key artists.  So, with his hustling skills and connections, he made half promises to managers and the city of Harlem about creating a festival at Mount Morris Park.  But with Maxwell House and Mayor John Lindsay backing him up, Tony Lawrence creates a festival with scores of acts and 300,000 attendees over six weeks.  Learning that this cultural festival of jazz, funk, blues, pop, gospel, latin, and pop music would happen, several people came together to film it.  That film sat in a basement for 50 years, until now.  Watch as Questlove talks to spectators, culturalists, artists, and organizers to bring this history out of the darkness and into the light.<br/><br/>1969 was a historic year for all Americans because there were assassinations, political change, and a moon landing.  But there was a culture shift happening in Harlem.  The days of buttoned-up suits disappeared for dashikis and afros, and the music of this time reflected this shift within the small community.  And the Harlem Cultural Festival mirrored it all.  Hopefully, with the popularity of this movie, the film's proprietors will release the concert in its entirety.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ellie Turner dances in her bedroom and listens to 60s music when she sees her mother's reflection in her mirror.  Then Ellie's grandmother, Peggy, calls Ellie downstairs.  Ellie got an acceptance letter from the London College of Fashion.  Peggy begs Ellie to take care of herself because she has the same 'gift' for seeing ghosts as her mother.  Ellie rents a room from Ms. Collins and gets comfortable.  On her first night in the house, Ellie dreams she is in 1960s London.  And when Ellie looks at her reflection, Ellie sees a young blonde girl.  The girl's name is Sandie, and she went to the Cafe de Paris to find the owner.  Sandie wants to become a singer and take over the London night scene.  The bartender tells Sandie the owner isn't there but a manager, Jack, is looking for new talent.  Soon they are on the dance floor, kissing and running away after Jack defends Sandie's honor.<br/><br/>Then Ellie wakes up and goes to class.  Jocasta spots a hickey on Ellie's neck, and Ellie remembers it's from Jack kissing Sandie.  Soon, Ellie dyes her hair, dresses, and talks like Sandie.  The next night, Ellie watches as Jack gets Sandie an audition at a club, and Sandie wows the owner.  When she is fast asleep, Ellie is in the audience.  She expects to see Sandie front and center, singing for the world to see.  But Sandie is another chorus girl in the burlesque show.  Sandie's dream is a nightmare that will leave her looking at the business end of a knife.  This stab into reality will haunt Ellie until she learns what happened to Sandie and the man responsible.<br/><br/>This film mixes the paranormal with teen drama and mystery. As Ellie looks at Sandie's life through Sandie's eyes, Ellie is envious of Sandie's tenacity.  When she learns the path Sandie's life spiraled into, Ellie stands outside of Sandie's body.  Being on the outside allowed Ellie to be more critical of Sandie instead of admiring her.  The film transports you when Ellie flashes back to Sandie's life.  And the edits between Sandie and Ellie are flawless.  When Sandie's end comes across the scene, it will be a poetic justice you were not expecting.  While the film does feel long and has an unnecessary romance, it is highly entertaining and will make you want to do a double-take.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Callie gets her kids, Trevor and Phoebe, ready to meet with an estate lawyer.  Her father died and left Callie a farmhouse in his will.  Inside the home, they find books to the ceiling, numbers on the crown molding, and a future riddled with repairs.  Then Janine walks into the home and tells Callie that her father only had the decrepit house, worthless land, and debt.  The next day, Callie drops Phoebe off at summer science camp, meets Phoebe's teacher, Gary Grooberson.  Then, Callie drops Trevor off at work.  At work, Trevor meets his crush, Lucky.  She invites Trevor to go to the old mine with other co-workers to have fun.  At the mine shaft, they see a glowing figure and hear noises.<br/><br/>At school, Gary puts on Kujo for his students.  Then, he steps back into his office.  Phoebe walks in, sees his seismic activity map, and asks Gary about it.  Gary explains that Summerville isn't on a fault line, but it shakes every day.  When Phoebe gets home, she notices a chess piece moved.  She grabs the PKE meter she found earlier and goes through the house.  Under the floor, Phoebe discovers a ghost trap.  She takes it to Gary, and he assumes it's a replica.  But when he touches it, the ghost trap starts to spark.  When the trap doesn't open, Gary taps it and releases a hell on earth not seen since 1984.<br/><br/>With a Revelations 6:12 warning, this movie builds up new characters while bridging the gap to the previous ones. With so many technological advancements, the director made a smart move by not changing the look or sound of the proton fire or the slime ghost's look.  However, newer graphics are clean and not distracting from the storyline.  With this careful distinction, the director invited new fans to the franchise without alienating the cult-like following of the 1984 classic.  And stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes.  They have fun with the past and build towards the future.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

When Charles gets some leave, he visits Dana in New York.  Then, September 11th brought reality to their relationship.

Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She tells Buster that the show is cute but not ready for the big leagues. Nana tells Buster that nobody can crush his dreams but him.

Buster and his friends finagle their way onto the audition stage, but Jimmy won't let them get past their intro.  Jimmy turns to leave.  In an outburst, Gunther says something that makes Jimmy turn around.  Gunther dreamed of a sci-fi play with Clay Calloway as the star.  No one has seen Clay since his wife died. Jimmy agrees to back the show and gives Buster 3 weeks to put it together.  The star, Rosita, needs to make a big dive in her performance.  But she is afraid of heights.  During a progress check, Jimmy's daughter, Porsha, shows Rosita how to do it.  Porsha demands to be the star, and Jimmy makes Buster do it.  But Porsha can't act.  Buster's final hurdle is Clay.  Buster and Ash go to talk to him, but Clay says no.  Ash can see how much Clay is hurting.  So she tells Buster to leave, and she will continue to help Clay take the stage.  After he downgrades Porsha, can Buster pull off the show of his career?<br/><br/>The sequel to Sing has all the laughs and foot-tapping music of the first movie.  But it doesn't have the same inspiring premises as its predecessor.  Also, the funniest moments are in the trailer.  With these few negatives, the movie still entertains with current and original songs.  This sequel makes the film feel final, so it's doubtful they will create a part three.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Hercule runs to the man to admonish him but stops when Hercule sees it's Bouc.  Bouc takes Hercule to meet his mother, Euphemia, and they invite Hercule to a wedding party.<br/><br/>At the party, Hercule sees Simon with his new bride, Linnet.  Stunning Linnet wears a 2 million dollar Tiffany necklace and a smile for her guests.  But a hush falls over the crowd when Jacqueline walks into the room.  During each leg of their trip, she appears unwanted to spoil their fun.  At the market, Hercule spots Jacqueline and attempts to plead to her better nature.  Jacqueline tells Hercule that she will never give up, and she has the perfect thing to fix a broken heart: a 22.  Hercule tells Simon and Linnet that they should end their trip, go home, and stay on the property until Jacqueline calms down.  But Simon refuses to let Jacqueline ruin their vacation, and he decides to gain distance by renting a ship, The Karnak, to travel the Nile.  And they invite Hercule to come aboard.<br/><br/>They travel to the rock temples at Abu Simbel, and Simon grabs Linnet for some alone time.  Then a rock comes close to killing the couple, but Hercule doesn't think it is an accident caused by the sand storm.  They board the boat in fear and find a shock.  Jacqueline awaits their return.  After night falls, Linnet takes a pill and resigns to her room.  Simon grows tired of Jacqueline's actions and makes his feelings known.  Jacqueline grabs her gun and shoots Simon in the leg.  Others pull them apart and Linnet's school friend, Rosalie, kicks the gun under the couch.  Linnet's ex-fiancé, Dr. Linus, tends to Simon's leg, and Linnet's godmother's nurse, Mrs. Bowers, calms Jacqueline down with morphine.<br/><br/>In the morning, Linnet's maid, Louise, finds Linnet dead with a gunshot to the head and her necklace missing.  At first, everyone blames Jacqueline, but Mrs. Bowers says she never left Jacqueline's side.  Hercule swears to find the killer before they hit land.<br/><br/>Based on Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie, this movie doesn't pick up exactly where the first one left off, but it does bring the films together.  You must watch from the beginning because the writer explains Hercule's famous mustache and wartorn start.  Within 30 minutes, the plot introduces all the characters and their connection to Linnet.  This chapter in the Hercule series is better than the first and will make you want more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
