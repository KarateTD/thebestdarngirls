    "review":"June attempts to adjust to her mother, Grace, dating Kevin. Kevin and Grace decided to take a vacation to Columbia. However, June is upset the trip overlaps Father's Day. June's father, James, died from a brain tumor when she was a young child. Although June is 18, Grace asked her friend, attorney Heather, to look in on June occasionally. Grace and Kevin leave in an Uber, and June kicks off a slew of alcohol-fueled parties.<br/><br/>After a week, June gets a reminder to pick up Grace and Kevin from the airport.

Grace calls Heather, and Heather sends Grace an international missing persons form and calls FBI Agent Park who can assist. Agent Park informs June that the United States doesn't have jurisdiction in Columbia. June calls Grace and Kevin's hotel and asks for their whereabouts. With the help of Google translate, she uncovers that Grace and Kevin left without their luggage. June looks at photos of the hotel online and sees security cameras. June decides to find Grace with or without anyone's help. She will uncover Kevin's lies, Grace's secrets, and the dark side of internet sleuthing.<br/><br/>This film echoes the same heart-pounding mystery you get from Searching, but viewers don't need to watch the previous movie to watch Missing. Viewers see the family did have a close relationship before James died, but teen rebellion drove a wedge between them. The film's technology use helps guide viewers through June's thought process. June finds locations, translates languages and uses live streaming to find her mother. With June's camera focused on her, you see the dread as she discovers more horrific information. Be ready to yell at the screen and cheer in relief. If you like Searching, you will love its standalone sequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"M3GAN",
    "review":"Gemma created the latest toy craze, PurrPetual Pets. But her boss, David, wants her to make a new model at a lower price. Instead of working on the updated Pet, Gemma and her team, Tess and Cole, keep working on the Model 3 Generative Android, M3gan, for short. Gemma tries a simple demo, but the doll's face melts. David leaves the room enraged and demands Gemma scrap M3gan and begin working on a cheaper Pet. Then Gemma gets a phone call from the hospital in Oregon. Her sister, Ava, and brother-in-law, Ryan, died in a car accident, but their daughter, Cady, survived.<br/><br/>Gemma moves Cady into her home but doesn't have toys, books, or a dedicated space for Cady. Cady comes into Gemma's workshop and shows Gemma her drawings. So, Gemma shows Cady a robot she made in college, Bruce. It's a motion caption robot using gloves to interact. Cady comments that it's a cool toy and the only one she would ever need. Gemma, Tess, and Cole work overtime to fix M3gan.<br/><br/>They invite David to a private meeting and have him watch M3gan interact with Cady. David loves M3gan and wants to present it to the board immediately. Gemma thinks the bond will help Cady recover after losing her parents, allow her to work, and put her company at number one. She wants Cady to be happy, the same as M3gan. Only M3gan will kill for it because Gemma forgot rule number one of toy designing: parental controls.<br/><br/>While Chucky starts creepy, M3gan is a lifesize Barbie on steroids. In true Blumhouse fashion, this script is funny, scary, and twisted. And it sets itself apart from other AI and doll movies because it discusses attachment theory. Cady becomes frighteningly dependent on M3gan and physically attacks Gemma when she can't have M3gan. While we are nowhere near this level of AI, Cady's misplaced attachment is the real threat in society today. Audiences will cringe, laugh, and OMG as M3gan takes over. This film is definitely worth a watch and discussion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Otto wakes up, goes to the hardware store, checks on the neighborhood, and goes to work. His co-workers surprise Otto with a retirement party. Otto scoffs at the Dyn and Merika signs for the new condos. The realtors are trying to entice Otto and his neighbors to sell, but they remain firm.<br/><br/>After Otto's neighborhood checks, he helps his new neighbor, Marisol, and her husband, Tommy, and their two daughters parallel park their moving trailer. Otto cancels his utilities, anchors a rope to the ceiling, and hangs himself. Otto sees visions of his late wife, Sonya, as he slips away, but the metal ring breaks before he dies. Otto isn't happy to be alive. Instead, he is upset that you can't find decent material these days. Otto doesn't see the point of living without Sonya, and Otto will try again to end it. However, the neighborhood he pushed away will unknowingly come to his rescue, and he theirs.<br/><br/>Based on A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman and a remake of A Man Called Ove, this movie weaves humor and sadness expertly. Otto is a grumpy, older man screaming at the changing of the times in the beginning. However, you get to know his story during each attempt. Otto's cantankerous behavior is valid, although misdirected. If you cried at the beginning of Up, be prepared to have your tissues ready. This film will stay with you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Before Tom can investigate, his airmen walk in, say hello, and rib him. One soldier, Ensign Jesse Brown, is standoffish, but Tom shakes his hand. Tom attempts to get closer to Jesse, but Jesse keeps his guard up. Until Tom offers Jesse a ride home because Jesse's car broke down. Tom meets Jesse's wife, Daisy, and their daughter, Pam. Daisy invites Tom in for a beer. She worries because the U.S. government gave the airmen their first mission. They will lend air support to the Korean War. Pam makes Tom promise to watch over Jesse. A new aircraft, some backward attitudes, and heavy firefights will test Tom's devotion to his promise.<br/><br/>Based on Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice by Adam Makos, this movie stands out from other historical tellings because there isn't a bad guy. Although Jesse receives media attention for his race and naval status, he doesn't want that to define him. Only his dedication to the country. Tom is a true definition of an ally. He quickly points out others' wrongdoings and listens to Jesse with an ear of compassion, not pity. This movie will leave a tear in your eye and gives these men their due.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Puss attempts to escape when the governor returns, but his party wakes a giant monster. Sadly, the bell Puss used to defeat the giant fell on Puss, killing him. Puss wakes with a veterinarian examining him. He tells Puss that he's run out of lives and needs to retire from adventures. The veterinarian gives Puss the address for Mama Luna's Cat Rescue. Puss goes to a bar to drink his cares away when a wolf sits next to him. Puss is fearless until the wolf draws blood. Puss's life flashes before his eyes, and he runs away. He buries his signature garb and retreats to Mama Luna's.<br/><br/>Puss slowly adjust to life as a house cat named Pickles and finds a dog hiding their. One day, Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family come to Mama Luna looking for Puss. They find his buried clothing on the property and assume Puss died.

Puss doesn't know that Jack, Goldi, the Bears, and the wolf are hot on their trail.<br/><br/>This sequel incorporates excellent animation with fantastic storytelling. It's unnecessary to see the first film or the Shrek movies to understand Puss In Boots. This movie expands on the legend of Puss and introduces new characters with ease. As you watch, notice each time they take a shot at Disney and Pixar movies while acknowledging Mary Poppins and Terminator. This film is excellent for the whole family while teaching an appreciation lesson to children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Avatar: The Way of the Water",
    "review":"It's been ten years since the Na'vi kicked humans off Omaticaya, but a few stayed. Dr. Norm and Dr. Max remained because they sided with the Na'vi and continued their studies. The humans left Spider behind because he was too young to go into cryostasis. He is the son of Colonel Miles and loves to be in the Pandora rainforest with Jake and his family instead of other humans. Jake and Neytiri have four children, Neteyam, Kiri, Lo'ak, and Tuk.<br/><br/>During date night, Jake and Neytiri notice an extra star in the sky. The humans are back. They create a massive fireball to destroy several habitats. However, Jake prepared the Na'vi, and they are battle ready. Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak go to Jake and Miles's last battle site. They find Na'vi in full camouflage and guns. The humans cloned Na'vi bodies and implanted a person's personality and memories in the bodies. Now, Colonel Miles is a walking Na'vi Trojan horse.<br/><br/>After a standoff between Jake and Miles, Miles takes Spider, and Jake runs with his kids. Staying will bring more devastation to her people, so they must leave their life behind. Jake and his family travel to the water and meet with Tonowari. He leads the reef people of Metkayina with his wife, Ronal, by his side. Jake and his family must learn the way of the water to survive on the reef. And they need to study it quickly. Cloning Na'vi isn't the only thing humans desire. However, Miles's need for revenge is his driving force to hunt Jake and his entire family with a captive Spider assisting.<br/><br/>The sequel to Avatar expands the cinematic world by introducing the reef people. Viewers get new animals, plant life, and customs in this new environment. This movie has a lengthy running time, but it doesn't feel 3 hours long. The audience is so immersed in the scenes and culture that you don't mind. The animators did a magnificent job blending real people with motion-capture characters. The moment Tonowari and Ronal discuss Jake and his family staying is the best-animated scene, and it had zero words. Tonowari and Ronal give each other stern looks, loving eyes, and a plea. You will laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer throughout the movie. This film goes beyond what fans expect and is worth the 13-year wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Andrew C. Thorton the second drops bags of cocaine from a plane onto the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in 1985. Andrew straps the final duffle to his harness and prepares to jump out of the plane. However, Andrew knocks himself unconscious on the airplane's door and dies. Knoxville resident, Fred Myers, finds Andrew's body and alerts the police. Detective Bob discovers Andrew works for Missouri dealer Syd and summarizes there are more drugs around the area.<br/><br/>Syd calls Daveed to the local restaurant. Syd wants Daveed to find his missing cocaine and take his son, Eddie, with him. And Syd must get the drugs back before the Columbians start asking questions. Daveed locates Eddie at a bar and convinces him to come to the forest to find the cocaine.<br/><br/>Sari informs her daughter, Dee Dee, that they won't paint the falls this weekend. Once Sari leaves, Dee Dee's friend, Henry, comes to the house. Dee Dee has a new plan. They will skip school and go to the forest so she can paint the falls without Sari. The school calls Sari, and she returns home and finds Henry's backpack. Inside, Sari finds a map of the falls and heads to the forest after them.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to anyone, a black bear found several kilos of drugs and ate them. Now, an apex predator is high on cocaine, and Dee Dee, Henry, Sari, Eddie, Daveed, and Bob are all headed in its direction. This doped bear will leave a trail of blood, guts, bones, and drool that no one will forget.<br/><br/>Viewers must prepare to laugh from beginning to end with amusing jump scares. While the plot is nothing like the real story, it uses the legend as its premise. Parents should understand this film is not for young kids. The editor added real news clips to the movie to bring you back to the period with the 'Say No To Drugs' and 'This is Your Brain On Drugs' campaigns. It also includes the report of Fred finding the body. Of course, the bear isn't flawless CGI, but that helps viewers see the movie as a comedy instead of pure horror. See this movie in theaters if you need a good laugh with your jump scare. And it has two post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sonny Vaccaro looks through game tapes to find the next athletic sponsor for Nike. The CEO, Phil Knight, authorized $250,000 for three players. Sonny has plenty on his shoulders because Nike's basketball division is floundering. Sonny sits in a marketing meeting with its head, Rob Strasser, and looks through the 1984 NBA draft picks. Sonny wants them to consider Michael Jordan, but the staff knows Jordan is expensive and prefers Adidas. Sonny leaves the meeting upset and looks over more college basketball tapes. While watching, he sees an Arthur Ashe commercial for tennis rackets and gets an idea. Instead of having a player put on their shoes, they design them for the player. The player and the shoe will become a brand within themselves.<br/><br/>Sonny flies to LA to talk to his friend, George Raveling, because George coached Michael Jordan in the Olympic tournament. George believes Sonny's instincts are right about the rookie but warns Sonny that Michael's parents, James and Deloris, are strongholds in their son's career. Sonny returns to Nike's headquarters and pitches his idea to Howard White. Howard signed Moses Malone to a Nike deal that remains their best acquisition. Howard admits he called Moses's mom to finalize the deal. Sonny takes George and Howard's advice and meets with Jordan's parents. After a revealing conversation with Deloris, Jordan's manager, David, calls Sonny with a flurry of insults and a Monday meeting. Sonny runs to Peter Moore and asks him to design the best shoe Nike has ever created. Sonny doesn't know, but his decision to pursue Michael Jordan will change Nike, athletic sponsorships, and Michael Jordan's finances forever.<br/><br/>A lot of care went into making this film. The director ensures this isn't a Michael Jordan movie. It's about Sonny, Deloris, and Nike. Sonny is the man behind the curtain. He understood the psychology behind the sport, its players, and its coaches. However, the driving force behind this deal was Deloris Jordan. She knew her son's worth to the game and wouldn't compromise his future. The music and technology will transport you back to 1984. Also, this film gives recognition to Peter's genius. Sneakers weren't just a fashion statement for him. They were a work of art. While the language is a bit much for younger viewers, audiences will love this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
