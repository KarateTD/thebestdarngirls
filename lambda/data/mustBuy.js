His family anxiously awaits his arrival, but his sister, Milagro, wants the family to be honest with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang>. Their father, Alberto, and mother, Rocio, tell Milagro to wait until <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> eats to give him the unfortunate news.<br/><br/>After <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes his first bite, Milagro tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> that his parents must sell their home. And Alberto had a heart attack. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> uncle Rudy blames Kord Industries for the gentrification. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> promises to find a job and move the family to a big house on the hills.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro got a job cleaning pools to make ends meet. As they scrape gum off the pool furniture, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> spots Veronica Kord and her private security, Ignacio, walking inside the home. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> can't work up the nerve to ask Veronica for a job, but Milagro has no problems using Veronica's bathroom.<br/><br/>Jennifer pulls her aunt, Veronica, into a room and watches an ad for the One Man Army Corp, a.k.a. OMAC. Jennifer reminds Veronica that Jennifer's father, Ted, didn't want Kord Industries involved in weapons manufacturing anymore. Veronica demands that Jennifer back off. Jennifer walks towards the door to exit, and Ignacio tries to grab her, but <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> verbally defends Jennifer. Veronica fires <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro. Jennifer tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> to come to Kord Industries, and she will find a job for him.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> arrives with his cheering family in tow. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> sees Jennifer running down an escalator and onto an elevator. He mirrors her movements and meets her downstairs. She hands <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> a burger container. She demands that he guard it with his life and never open it.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes it home, and his family encourages him to open the box. They all play with the high-tech scarab inside. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> touches it, it scans his face, goes inside his body, and attaches to his spine. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> wakes up, he is on his parents' couch naked. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> steals Rudy's car to get answers from Jennifer. After dodging a hail of bullets, Jennifer sits with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> family to explain. The scarab is a world-destroying weapon that chooses its hosts. Veronica needs its code to complete her OMAC project. With the scarab active, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> is in danger. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> wants Jennifer to remove the scarab now. The journey to expelling the scarab will make <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> experience the ultimate sacrifice, learn the truth about Nana, and uncover his destiny to become the Blue Beetle.<br/><br/>First, Nana is a gangster. Second, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> is a reluctant hero. Finally, his family doesn't sit around waiting for <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> to save them. The graphics are stellar for a DC film. This color palette of the film reflects <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and his family. It's fun, bright, and burst with excitement. The downside of this movie is the sound effects drown out <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> suit's A.I., Khaji-Da. See this film on the best screen possible, and don't let the detractors keep you away. Also, there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Days ago, Ethan got a message to find his ally Ilsa Faust and obtain the missing half of a cruciform key. After giving Ethan his instructions, Eugene Kittridge loses contact with Ethan. Kittridge sits in a classified meeting with Director Denlinger and his advisors and reveals information about Impossible Mission Force. Kittridge explains that experimental Artificial Intelligence meant to hack digital information went rogue and became self-aware and self-learning. They call it the Entity, the biggest threat to the world. They need Ethan to destroy it because other world powers know about the Entity and seek to harness it for global domination. Ethan must remain resilient against his past to secure the world's future. But can Ethan risk the ones he loves?<br/><br/>Based on the TV series, this Mission Impossible installment is the seventh in the franchise and lives up to the crazy stunts and spine-tingling drama of the previous six. The writers inject the right amount of humor at the most opportune moments. New fans don't need to see the previous movies to understand this film. The plot sticks to AI and Machine Learning fears in other films, but the action sets it apart. There are zero mid-credit or post-credit scenes. And yes, it ends on the perfect cliffhanger. Fans of the franchise won't be disappointed and will look forward to part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Barbie goes to the beach to relax, and Ken waits for Barbie to notice him. Ken asks to visit Barbie's house, and she invites him to her blowout party with choreography.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Barbie's party until Barbie asks them if they think about death. She laughs it off and continues dancing. In the morning, Barbie wakes up tired, her waterless shower is cold, and the pretend breakfast isn't edible. Barbie confesses that something is wrong, and the other Barbies tell her to go to Weird Barbie.<br/><br/>Barbie goes to Weird Barbie and tells her everything that happened. Barbie's little girl in the real world is sad, and it affects how she plays with Barbie. Barbie doesn't understand how this could happen because playing with Barbie made the lives of real girls perfect like her. Barbie heads to the real world with Ken stowing away in the backseat. She will find her girl, help her, and return to Barbieland with her body and mind in tack. However, the real world will change Barbieland in ways Barbie never dreamed, but Ken always imagined.<br/><br/>This movie starts with all the pink, butterflies, and glitter you expect from Barbie. It has all the Barbies you remember as a little child, even discontinued Barbies like Midge, Growing Up Skipper, and TV Barbie. When she enters the real world, she sees it isn't perfect. And little girls aren't thanking her for making a difference. Ken sees the human world and loves it. Men are working, driving big cars, and focusing on each other. The real world has a lasting effect on both of them.<br/><br/>As the trailer says, this film is for people who love and hate Barbie because it focuses on Barbie's issues while addressing her contributions. During the trip to Barbie, Barbie talks to her owner, Sasha, and Sasha's mother, Gloria. Gloria gives a speech to Barbie, who is having an existential crisis, and it will make you sigh with understanding and exhaustion. You leave this film with your eyes open, your feelings heard, and loving Barbie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Indiana Jones and Basil Shaw battle the Nazis to recover the Lance of Longinus on a Nazi plunder train. However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist Jürgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half. Jones takes Helena to the school's archives and removes the machine from a hidden drawer. When CIA operatives distract Jones, Helena grabs the Dial and runs away.<br/><br/>The operatives work for Voller, who now hides as a NASA scientist on the recently-successful Apollo 11 project. They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

He recounts his life before and during his government work under scads scrutiny. He teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and dedicates time to the California Institute of Technology. Oppenheimer crosses paths with Ernest Lawrence, Jean Tatlock, and his future wife, Katherine Puening.<br/><br/>General Leslie Groves seeks out Oppenheimer to work on the Manhattan Project but worries Oppenheimer's communist ties will delay his clearance. Oppenheimer assures Groves that he only has an academic interest in the party, not a devotion. Oppenheimer wasn't sure about creating the Atomic Bomb but wanted to end World War II. So he agreed to do it because the only scientist in Germany with Oppenheimer's knowledge was Jewish. They know Hitler won't give him funding.<br/><br/>Oppenheimer convinces Groves to create a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with places to pray, shop, and attend school. Oppenheimer and his researchers work before the town is complete, and William L. Borden enters with startling calculations. His math proves the Atomic Bomb could cause an explosion in the atmosphere and create a chain reaction that destroys the world. Oppenheimer asks Lewis Strauss to introduce him to Albert Einstein. He gives Albert the calculations, and Albert confirms them. Oppenheimer must continue his work with the constant threat of annihilation hanging over his head. And he will bring death to thousands if it works as expected. Can Oppenheimer accept the applause and responsibility of being a modern-day Prometheus?<br/><br/>The director made this movie with extreme precision for the period, the scientists, and their struggles. If you pay close attention, this historical film has the drama of a daytime soap opera. This movie follows Oppenheimer's life before, during, and after the Atomic Bomb. It acknowledges his flaws and brilliance throughout his career. Also, it addresses some controversies and conspiracies that surrounded him. This battle is compelling because it's between two competitive, intelligent, and petty men. This movie covers ample history, but it's not for children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Lorenzo takes too long, and Robert kills him and Lorenzo's remaining goons. Robert walks outside, sees Lorenzo's son in the truck, and tells the boy to stay put.

The movie gives you a brief flashback into the first film while giving a quip to the second. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and brutal. In between Robert's fighting and mingling, Emma uncovers a mystery with Robert's guidance.

Briggsy can't believe it because hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, are shorting the stock. Keith goes home to his wife, Caroline, and baby girl. He posted his ideas on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, but no one listened. Caroline tells him to make another video. Keith walks to his basement, changes his shirt, puts on a red headband, and goes live as Roaring Kitty.<br/><br/>Jenny, a nurse, is a divorced mother of two and follows Wall Street Bets. She listens to Roaring Kitty and buys GameStop stock on the Robinhood app. Marcos works at GameStop and sees it struggling. Marcos decides to put a few dollars into GameStop after watching the stream. RiRi, a college student, has over $100,000 in student loan debt. She invested money into GameStop and encouraged others to do the same. Harmony listens to RiRi, watches Roaring Kitty, and starts to invest while falling for RiRi.<br/><br/>By January, Steve Cohen calls Gabe about GME. He warns Gabe that one person is driving up the buying. Gabe watches a few clips and doubles down on the short sale. Ken Griffin laughs at retail investors and calls them Dumb Money. The hedge fund managers aren't the only people watching GameStop. Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, owners of the Robinhood App, saw the number of users skyrocket. But none of them know that the Apes will expose Robinhood and cause a short squeeze that will spark a media frenzy, social payback, and a congressional hearing.<br/><br/>Based on The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, this movie mixes real-life events with a compilation of stories from retail investors. The plot doesn't describe how to short a stock, what hedge funds are, or what a short squeeze is. Instead, the audience gets to know the man behind Roaring Kitty. He ignited the masses and made investment companies take the Apes seriously. This film has engaging dialogue, great music, and realistic portrayals. It gives you an overview of the players, their jobs, and their net worth. The audience sees how they all fared at the end. They wanted to take down the system but became the product. So, sit back, take notes, and enjoy the social gamification of the market.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Then, Vitale shows Hercule an apple, and Hercule knows that author Ariadne Oliver is there. An actress, Rowena Drake, hired a medium, Joyce Reynolds, to communicate with her deceased daughter, Alicia, in a séance. Alicia committed suicide after her fiancé, Maxime, left her and six months later became engaged to another woman. Ariadne was able to uncover fakes before but believes Joyce is the real deal. Ariadne is writing a book about Joyce, and proving Joyce wrong will make the book a best-seller.<br/><br/>Hercule, Ariadne, and Vitale arrive at Rowena's home and hear it's haunted history. Rowena opens her doors to let the children play on Halloween, but Leopold wants to read his book instead. Leopold doesn't want to participate in the activities because his father, Dr. Ferrier, suffers from trauma. Joyce arrives with her assistant, Desdemona Holland, wearing a cloak and mask. Before everyone walks into the salon, Rowena's housekeeper, Olga Semioff, screams at the front door. Maxime received an invitation to the séance and demands to attend.<br/><br/>Joyce puts a typewriter in the corner of the room, and Desdemona stands next to it.

Can Hercule uncover the killer before losing his mind?<br/><br/>Based on Hallowe'en Party by Agatha Christie, this movie starts with Hercule happily leaving the mystery world behind. The house has a horrid history with a plague, causing doctors and nurses to leave children to die. This tale leaves the plot open to ghosts with targets in their crosshairs. This film has plot points from Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. Hercule fans know to keep their eyes and ears open for every clue. And this time, you may spot the nugget of truth hidden in a brief exchange. This movie isn't the best, but you will leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The Paw Patrol gets a distress call from the J and H Junkyard. Someone stole their 10-ton magnet and started a fire during the getaway. The pups save Janet and Hank but wonder why someone would steal it. They don't ponder for long because they want to run home to see the meteor shower over Adventure Bay. The crew readies the snacks as Ryder introduces them to The Junior Patrollers, Nano, Tot, and Mini. The meteor is heading toward Adventure Bay. They run to the town, secure everyone, and clear a path. Ryder and the pups go to the crater and find the meteor pulsating. Ryder decides to examine it in his lab.<br/><br/>The news reports that Victoria Vance pulled the meteor to Earth and broadcast her crime on social media. She used the powerful magnet to attract the meteor because something powerful was inside. The police find her post, arrest Victoria, and put her in jail. Her new cellmate is Mayor Humdinger and his cats.<br/><br/>A bright light wakes up Skye, and she walks towards it. She touches the meteor, and it shatters, leaving seven crystals behind. One crystal attaches to her collar, and Sky can fly. Each crystal latches on to them. Rubble becomes a wrecking ball while Chase gets super speed. Zuma can control and become water, while Marshall can shoot fireballs from his paws. And Zuma becomes Magneto. Liberty tries with all her might but doesn't have powers. Adventure Bay marvels at their upgraded heroes and plasters them all over the news. Victoria sees the report and vows to take back the pups' powers. Humdinger offers to help break Victoria out if she shares their abilities. Can the Paw Patrol defeat Victoria and Humdinger before she takes their powers?<br/><br/>Before the movie starts, their is a short music video, a Dora short, and Pup theater etiquette for the kids. This constant change may confuse younger viewers, so parents should be ready to explain. The film is good clean entertainment with lots of action. Also, it provides an origin story for Skye. The graphics and storyline are fun for the entire family. There are jokes for adults, but they are not innuendoes. The movie is comically self-aware and entertains without dumbing down the content or making inappropriate quips over kids' heads. Bring the entire family to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars for kids and 3.5 out of 5 stars for adults.",
