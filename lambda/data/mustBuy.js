    "mtitle":"Respect",
    "review":"In Detroit, 1952, Reverend Clarence wakes up his daughter, Aretha, to sing for his famous friends, including Duke, Ella, and Dinah.  She wows the famous crowd.  Since her parents' divorce, Aretha spends some days with her mom, Barbara, but resides with Clarence and her grandmother. A couple of years later, Aretha was a mother of two but refused to name the father.  She sings at marches for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but Aretha wants to do more for the movement. When Aretha announces that she wants to march, Clarence has a surprise for her.  He talked to record companies about Aretha, and a record company in New York wants to sign her.  Four albums later, Aretha doesn't have a hit record.  Dinah tells Aretha to stop being so proper and find her voice.  It will take new management, two husbands, and a drinking problem for Aretha to find her voice in a path she made, one song at a time.<br/><br/>Following the treacherous example set by Clarence, Aretha went from one controlling man to another. She admired leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Angela Davis, but Aretha didn't know how to stand up for herself.  In meetings, the record producers, tour managers, and her father made the decisions while Aretha sat quietly. She existed with unspeakable pain that followed her, and her family calls it her demon.  It will take a Times article, a heavenly spirit, and a choir director for Aretha to shake that demon and create the best album of her career.  Having an actress that can do Aretha's voice justice, was the best move by the director.  You didn't lose focus with bad dubbing or bad acting.  This story of triumph and its honest telling will inspire and move you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Suicide Squad",
    "review":"Amanda Waller needs to assemble a larger team for her new mission, Operation Starfish.  She gathers three members of the original Suicide Squad - Rick Flag, Harley Quinn, and Boomerang - and adds more firepower to the team.  She gets T.D.K, Savant, Black guard, Javelin, Mongal, and Weasel to join. While this team is a formidable opponent for any enemy, Waller created another without telling Flag.  This team consists of Nanaue, Bloodsport, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and Peacemaker.  These teams have to travel to Corto Maltese and infiltrate the Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory.  The Thinker is conducting experiments with alien technology to overthrow the American government.  After Team A fails, leaving Harley Quinn and Rick Flag prisoners, Team B will go on a bloody rampage to complete the mission.<br/><br/>O.M.G! James Gunn added the wit of Deadpool to the blood and guts of The Kingsman with Tarantino storytelling.  This movie not only holds up to its name, but it gives you the darkness you would expect from a D.C. comic.  While you are enjoying the often-uncomfortable humor, you see awe-inspiring juxtaposition in many fight scenes. The camera angles and framing give the viewer a different view of each fight scene. Seeing the first movie isn't necessary to enjoy this film. This movie is worth the theater price but not for kids nor tweens.  And stay past the end credits for a glimpse of survivors.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Guy works as a banker in Free City.  Every day, Guy wakes up, says hi to his goldfish, gets coffee, goes to work, gets robbed multiple times, and goes home.  The robbers are the sunglasses people. While Guy adores his life, he tells his best friend, Buddy, the bank security guard, that he is missing something: love. As Guy walks down the street with Buddy, he sees a woman humming a familiar song and becomes fixated on her.  Buddy reminds Guy that the woman is wearing sunglasses and sunglasses people don't talk to them. Guy decides to get a pair of sunglasses and talk to his dream woman.  During the next bank robbery, Guy gets up and asks the robber for his glasses.  When Guy tries to take them, he accidently shoots the robber, gets the glasses, and follows the woman.  She is Molotov Girl, a level 197, experienced player. Molotov Girl tells Guy to put on the glasses, and Guy sees a whole new world of experience points, money, and power-ups.  Molotov Girl tells Guy to rob or punch someone, and he will level up quickly.  But Guy doesn't want to hurt people. Guy's nice guy routine catches the world by storm because Guy is an Non-Player Character or NPC in the world's most popular game, Free City. But Guy doesn't know it.  Molotov Girl does, and in real life, she is Millie, a game designer.  In 2015, Millie and Walter, a.k.a. Keys, created a world with AI.  People can watch as the NPCs learn, grow, and develop lives.  While Keys works for Soonami and its owner Antwan, Millie sued them.  She believes Antwan stole their base code to create Free City.  She spends her time in the game trying to find the proof on an unseen level. At first, Millie needed Guy to prove her case, but now she will need Guy to save himself, Free City, and his friends before Antwan destroys the servers.<br/><br/>This movie speaks to anyone who felt like a background character in their lives. While this movie inspires, it highlights issues in the gaming world.  This mix of Jumanji: The Next Level, Ready Player One, and The Lego Movie has memorable moments, laughable dialogue, a love story, and lots of easter eggs.  In the end, you will learn that someone created Guy with a purpose, and he isn't any ordinary NPC.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

While holding the record for most running yards in a season, Jim Brown feels respected on the field, but not off it. As they sit in the hotel room trying to convince Malcolm to party, the men will scold each other's motives, interrogate their role in the black community, and question their future.  After this one night, each man's life will change forever.<br/><br/>Based on the One Night in Miami play, this provocative tale, inspired by real-life events, will leave you awestruck with brilliant performances.  The conversations between these men are poignant, striking, provoking, and critical for their advancement. But after one night together, these in-depth and controversial conversations inspire change in each man.  Whether it's a song, a name, a job, or a book, the world will grow from it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tony Lawrence heard about the upcoming Woodstock festival but realized it was missing key artists.  So, with his hustling skills and connections, he made half promises to managers and the city of Harlem about creating a festival at Mount Morris Park.  But with Maxwell House and Mayor John Lindsay backing him up, Tony Lawrence creates a festival with scores of acts and 300,000 attendees over six weeks. Learning that this cultural festival of jazz, funk, blues, pop, gospel, latin, and pop music would happen, several people came together to film it.  That film sat in a basement for 50 years, until now.  Watch as Questlove talks to spectators, culturalists, artists, and organizers to bring this history out of the darkness and into the light.<br/><br/>1969 was a historic year for all Americans because there were assassinations, political change, and a moon landing.  But there was a culture shift happening in Harlem.  The days of buttoned-up suits disappeared for dashikis and afros, and the music of this time reflected this shift within the small community.  And the Harlem Cultural Festival mirrored it all. Hopefully, with the popularity of this movie, the film's proprietors will release the concert in its entirety.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"It's been 30 years since Prince Akeem went to America and defied his father and tradition to find true love with his Princess, Lisa.  Now, Akeem and Lisa have three daughters: Meeka, Omma, and Tinashe.  While Akeem loves his daughters, his father, King Jaffe, reminds him only a male can be heir to the throne.  General Izzi of Nextdoria is furious with Akeem because Akeem didn't marry his sister Imani. Izzi wants Meeka to marry his son to restore the bond between the two countries. Before Akeem can speak, King Jaffe calls Akeem to his sickbed.  A shaman saw a vision of Akeem's first-born, only son living in Queens. Jaffe tells Akeem to go to Queens and get his son.  Then have his son marry Izzi's only daughter, Bopoto.  Their family would still rule Zamunda, and Nextdoria's tradelines will open.  Semmi and Akeem travel to Queens and notice the changes to the neighborhood instantly.  They go to the local barbershop and show the shaman's drawing of Akeem's son, and the shop owners recognize the boy as Lavelle Junson and give Lavelle's location. After talking to Lavelle, Lavelle brings Akeem and Semmi to meet his family, including his mother, Mary. Lavelle doesn't want to go to Zamunda until he sees the gold bricks Semmi possesses.  Lavelle agrees to go, but only if Mary can go too.  Lavelle can't wait to be a prince.  But when this prince feels like a diplomatic pawn, will he fall in line or blaze his father's path?<br/><br/>The sequel to Coming to America has the laughs and lessons from the first movie.  A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Shaun works as a valet with his best friend, Katy, and any chance they get to lollygag, they take it. They talk on the bus about their futures and their family's expectations.  A man approaches Shaun and tells Shaun to give him his pendant.  Shaun refuses, and the gang of men fight. With unstable motion, the bus knocks out the driver.  Katy gets into the driver's seat during the fight.  Together, Katy and Shaun save the passengers and fight off the men.  But they take Shaun's pendant. He tells Katy that he has to find his sister, Xialing, and save her from their father, Wenwu.  This detail stuns Katy because she never knew Shaun had any family.  He tells Katy that he is getting on the next flight to see Xialing, and Katy doesn't hesitate to go with him.  On the flight, Shaun explains that his name is Shang-Chi.  And love, pain, and revenge blanket his family history. For thousands of years, Wenwu grew power exponentially thanks to the ten rings he found or stole, depending on which legend you believe.  Then, Wenwu learned of a forest called Ta Lo with mythical creatures that possessed unknown strength. He travels to Ta Lo and finds a beautiful woman, Jiang Li. Jiang Li protects Ta Lo and all its strength.  The two fell in love and tried to stay in Ta Lo, but they ex-communicated Jiang Li and stripped her of her powers.  After Jiang Li died, Wenwu raised Shang-Chi to be an assassin while developing the ten rings gang.  When Shang-Chi turned 16, Wenwu asked Shang-Chi to avenge his mother.  Shang-Chi left and never came back.  Now, Shang-Chi must save his sister before Wenwu comes for her.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the synopsis because there is still more story to go.  The brief overview is only 30 minutes into the movie. This movie separates itself with a storyline that doesn't focus on good or evil but grief and loss.  In the beginning, everything is more realistic, but as the story delves deeper into Ta Lo, it becomes more magical, like Dr. Strange. The graphics are the best yet for the MCU, and the bus fight scene is one of the best. It puts Captain Marvel and Spider-Man to shame.  And let's never forget the fight between Wenwu and Jiang Li.  Their combative dance of love and power is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Once all the players, plots, and bullets are in place, the knockdown, drag-out fight begins.  Be aware there are no wasted moments on screen.  The broadcasts, backstories, and jokes have a point to the overall plot. This movie takes its time, but it's worth every second to see these opposing forces battle it out.  Based on the ending, maybe we will get a part two.  Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
