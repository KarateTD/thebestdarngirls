    "review": "Thomas sits at his desk creating a video game named Binary when he gets a warning that a hacker purged the Modal 101 file.  While Thomas looks into the hack, Jude tells him their boss, Smith, wants to see him.  Their parent company, Warner Brothers, wants to make a sequel to his trilogy game, The Matrix.  And they will make it with or without Thomas.  Thomas starts to panic because he had a mental breakdown after creating the game.  He couldn't discern reality from dreams.  Now, Thomas sees a therapist to maintain his mental state.<br/><br/>Thomas goes to a coffee shop with co-worker Jude, and Jude forces Thomas to talk to a woman he fixates on every day.  The woman is Tiffany, and she is married with two sons.  Later, they see each other and question him about his game.  She thinks a character, Trinity, looks like her.  Thomas goes back to his office, and an alarm forces an evacuation.  Before Thomas leaves the building, he gets a text message to go to the bathroom.  A man walks out of the stall and introduces himself as Morpheus, and Thomas panics.  Thomas runs to his therapists to handle reality but ends up on top of the roof.  He attempts to jump off and fly when Bugs grabs him.  She tells him the Matrix is real and shows her bunny tattoo.  Her world knows him as the one Neo, and he follows her into the Matrix.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the trilogy has all the effects and wild storylines from its predecessor.  It shows clips of the past for people new to the series.  But, there are phrases, jokes, and other nuances you won't understand without seeing the other films.  While it created an end to the trilogy, it left the door open for something new for the next generation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Journal for Jordan",
    "review":"Dana visits her father for his birthday and walks in to find a stranger.  He introduces himself as 1st Sergeant Charles Monroe King.  Charles tells Dana that her father is on the back porch, and he was hanging a picture that he painted.  Soon they are talking on the phone every day. When Charles gets some leave, he visits Dana in New York.  Then, September 11th brought reality to their relationship.  While Charles is at the range, Dana tells him that she wants to start a family.  He one-ups her and asks to get married, and she says yes.  Soon Dana is pregnant, but he has his orders.  So Dana gives Charles a journal filled with questions for a father to answer for his child.  Years later, Dana will use that journal to guide her son, Jordan, through difficult moments of his life, like dealing with Charles's death.<br/><br/>Based on A Journal for Jordan: A Story of Love and Honor by Dana Canedy, this film is a heartfelt love letter to Jordan about his parents.  Although he doesn't remember his father, Jordan can read the love Charles held in his heart.  Because this movie doesn't have a linear timeline, you can't be late.  The film starts with the spark that made Dana write the book.  While their love was short, their words will exist forever.  FYI, this movie is for adults.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"It's been 30 years since Prince Akeem went to America and defied his father and tradition to find true love with his Princess, Lisa.  Now, Akeem and Lisa have three daughters: Meeka, Omma, and Tinashe.  While Akeem loves his daughters, his father, King Jaffe, reminds him only a male can be heir to the throne.  General Izzi of Nextdoria is furious with Akeem because Akeem didn't marry his sister Imani.  Izzi wants Meeka to marry his son to restore the bond between the two countries.  Before Akeem can speak, King Jaffe calls Akeem to his sickbed.  A shaman saw a vision of Akeem's first-born, only son living in Queens.  Jaffe tells Akeem to go to Queens and get his son.  Then have his son marry Izzi's only daughter, Bopoto.  Their family would still rule Zamunda, and Nextdoria's tradelines will open.  Semmi and Akeem travel to Queens and notice the changes to the neighborhood instantly.  They go to the local barbershop and show the shaman's drawing of Akeem's son, and the shop owners recognize the boy as Lavelle Junson and give Lavelle's location.  After talking to Lavelle, Lavelle brings Akeem and Semmi to meet his family, including his mother, Mary.  Lavelle doesn't want to go to Zamunda until he sees the gold bricks Semmi possesses.  Lavelle agrees to go, but only if Mary can go too.  Lavelle can't wait to be a prince.  But when this prince feels like a diplomatic pawn, will he fall in line or blaze his father's path?<br/><br/>The sequel to Coming to America has the laughs and lessons from the first movie.  A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman.  And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Before Venus and Serena's birth, Richard wrote a detailed plan for their tennis career.  While he believes in his daughters, Richard can't get someone to coach the girls for free.  With his brochure getting little traction, Richard packs up Venus and Serena and drives them to see Paul Cohen.  Richard talks Paul into watching the girls hit a few balls, and Paul is impressed.  But he tells Richard that he can only coach Venus for the junior tournaments.  This moment is the first time something hasn't gone according to the plan.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown.<br/><br/>King Richard tells the story of a complicated man in a battle with himself and the world for what he pre-ordained.

    "mtitle":"The Batman",
    "review":"It's Halloween.  And while most of Gotham celebrate candy and debauchery, Bruce Wayne uses his mask for vengeance against the city's underbelly.  Batman has looked over the citizens with Lieutenant Gordon and his signal for two years.  Someone killed mayor Don Mitchell, wrapped his head in tape, cut off his thumb, and wrote 'No More Lies' on him.  The killer, The Riddler, left a card for 'The Batman' with a cipher inside.  The Riddler vows to kill more people and unmask the corruption in Gotham.  Batman uncovers pictures of the mayor with a young woman, that is not his wife, coming out of the Iceberg Lounge.<br/><br/>During questioning, a waitress walks into the room.  She freezes when she sees the photos.  The waitress goes to her apartment that she shares with the young woman, Annika, from the images.  The waitress promises to help Annika getaway.  After changing clothes, the waitress gingerly leaves the apartment through a window.  She goes to the mayor's home, an active crime scene, finds a hidden safe and cracks it.  She pulls out Annika's stolen passport when Batman grabs her.  The waitress is Selina Kyle, Catwoman.  Batman worries about the cat burglar and follows Selina back to her apartment.  Annika and their phones are gone.  Selina tells Batman that she will find answers in the 44 Below Club.  It's a private club within the Iceberg Lounge where the crooked politicians and cops hang out.  Batman knows this will be a target-rich environment for the Riddler, so he devises a plan for him and Selina to work together.  In 7 days, Batman will learn that his mask can inspire hope, create resentment, and reveal dark aspirations.  And all roads lead to Arkham.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best Batman movies since The Dark Knight.  It provides action, mystery, a few jump-scares, and intensely emotional moments.  This movie assumes you know Batman's backstory.  While the story and acting were impressive, the running time made the movie drag.  Don't be surprised if you wonder 'is this the end' several times.  The end credits will tempt you to stay, but there are zero spoilers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Fifteen years ago, Nate and his brother, Sam, tried to steal Magellan's map.  It was the first map of the world with a secret to where Magellan and his crew hid billions in gold.  A security guard catches them and turns them over to the nuns at the orphanage.  This is Sam's third strike, and he must leave the orphanage to meet with a judge.  Sam goes upstairs to get his things, and Nate follows.  Nate sees Sam about to escape, and Nate begs him not to leave him.  Sam gives Nate a ring, a lighter, a letter, and a promise to return.<br/><br/>Today, Nate is a bartender with a lot of historical knowledge and sticky fingers.  He lifts a bracelet from a customer when a man, Sully, gives him praise.  Nate refuses to work with Sully, and Sully leaves.  Nate checks his pockets, and Sully's business card is in the bracelet's place.  Nate breaks into Sully's home and finds Sully waiting for him.  Sully notices that Nate stopped at the map on the wall before looking for the bracelet.  Then, Sully tells Nate the map is authentic, like the treasure.  To get it, they need two crosses because they're the key.  Sully already has one, but the other will be in an auction.  Nate doesn't want to be a part of the plan, but Sully mentions Sam.  Sully thinks that finding the treasure will lead to Sam.  Nate will quickly learn that there is no honor among thieves.<br/><br/>Based on Uncharted for Playstation, this movie is how game adaptations should be from this point forward.  It was funny, captivating, and suspenseful.  This film was Indiana Jones and National Treasure with a bit of Goonies.  It's no surprise that the mid-credits scene gives sequel hints.  Some action sequences feel like watching a high-resolution video game.  The film never gets slow or bogged down with unnecessary love stories.  Enjoy this adaption on the big screen for maximum viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Suki is an agent for Crystal Entertainment.  Suki starts to leave before the second act, and Buster chases after her to find out why.  She tells Buster that the show is cute but not ready for the big leagues. Nana tells Buster that nobody can crush his dreams but him.  If he wants something, he needs to fight for it.<br/><br/>Buster comes up with a plan, but he needs one more arrow in his quiver: Ash.  Buster and his friends finagle their way onto the audition stage, but Jimmy won't let them get past their intro.  Jimmy turns to leave.  In an outburst, Gunther says something that makes Jimmy turn around.  Gunther dreamed of a sci-fi play with Clay Calloway as the star.  No one has seen Clay since his wife died. Jimmy agrees to back the show and gives Buster 3 weeks to put it together.  The star, Rosita, needs to make a big dive in her performance.  But she is afraid of heights.  During a progress check, Jimmy's daughter, Porsha, shows Rosita how to do it.  Porsha demands to be the star, and Jimmy makes Buster do it.  But Porsha can't act.  Buster's final hurdle is Clay.  Buster and Ash go to talk to him, but Clay says no.  Ash can see how much Clay is hurting.  So she tells Buster to leave, and she will continue to help Clay take the stage.  After he downgrades Porsha, can Buster pull off the show of his career?<br/><br/>The sequel to Sing has all the laughs and foot-tapping music of the first movie.  But it doesn't have the same inspiring premises as its predecessor.  Also, the funniest moments are in the trailer.  With these few negatives, the movie still entertains with current and original songs.  This sequel makes the film feel final, so it's doubtful they will create a part three.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Bouc takes Hercule to meet his mother, Euphemia, and they invite Hercule to a wedding party.<br/><br/>At the party, Hercule sees Simon with his new bride, Linnet.  Stunning Linnet wears a 2 million dollar Tiffany necklace and a smile for her guests.  But a hush falls over the crowd when Jacqueline walks into the room.  During each leg of their trip, she appears unwanted to spoil their fun.  At the market, Hercule spots Jacqueline and attempts to plead to her better nature.  Jacqueline tells Hercule that she will never give up, and she has the perfect thing to fix a broken heart: a 22.  Hercule tells Simon and Linnet that they should end their trip, go home, and stay on the property until Jacqueline calms down.  But Simon refuses to let Jacqueline ruin their vacation, and he decides to gain distance by renting a ship, The Karnak, to travel the Nile.  And they invite Hercule to come aboard.<br/><br/>They travel to the rock temples at Abu Simbel, and Simon grabs Linnet for some alone time.  Then a rock comes close to killing the couple, but Hercule doesn't think it is an accident caused by the sand storm.  They board the boat in fear and find a shock.  Jacqueline awaits their return.  After night falls, Linnet takes a pill and resigns to her room.  Simon grows tired of Jacqueline's actions and makes his feelings known.  Jacqueline grabs her gun and shoots Simon in the leg.  Others pull them apart and Linnet's school friend, Rosalie, kicks the gun under the couch.  Linnet's ex-fiancé, Dr. Linus, tends to Simon's leg, and Linnet's godmother's nurse, Mrs. Bowers, calms Jacqueline down with morphine.<br/><br/>In the morning, Linnet's maid, Louise, finds Linnet dead with a gunshot to the head and her necklace missing.  At first, everyone blames Jacqueline, but Mrs. Bowers says she never left Jacqueline's side.  Hercule swears to find the killer before they hit land.<br/><br/>Based on Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie, this movie doesn't pick up exactly where the first one left off, but it does bring the films together.  You must watch from the beginning because the writer explains Hercule's famous mustache and wartorn start.  Within 30 minutes, the plot introduces all the characters and their connection to Linnet.  This chapter in the Hercule series is better than the first and will make you want more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
