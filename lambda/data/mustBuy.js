    "review":"Santa Claus stops at a bar in England and drinks before delivering presents to nice boys and girls. But people's growing greed and selfishness leave Santa jaded about the holidays. He gets in his sleigh and heads into the night.<br/><br/>In Connecticut, Jason waits for his estranged wife, Linda, and their daughter, Trudy, with a gift for his mother, Gertrude. Trudy admits she's sad because Jason didn't take her to see Santa and make her Christmas wish. They arrive at Gertrude's massive estate, and Jason's sister, Alva, is there with her son, Bert, and boyfriend, Morgan. Alva accuses Jason of sucking up to Gertrude for the business, but Jason ignores her.<br/><br/>Later that night, Jason still feels guilty for Trudy missing Santa. So he wraps up a walkie-talkie with earbuds and gives it to her. He tells Trudy it's a magic walkie-talkie that can communicate directly with Santa. As Trudy sleeps, the adults argue about the company, Christmas gifts, and money. They don't notice the catering staff has guns and kills security. A man called Scrooge enters and demands cash from Gertrude. Sources told Scrooge that Gertrude stole $300,000,000 from the government and hid it in a vault on the property. Until they get the money, Scrooge and his accomplices will hold the family hostage.<br/><br/>Upstairs, Santa eats cookies, drinks Bourbon, and sits in a massage chair. He hears the commotion downstairs and tries to escape. However, his magic isn't working. Frosty, a henchman, spots Santa and gets into a bloody battle. As Santa looks for another way to escape, he hears a sound coming from the closet. He finds the other walkie-talkie and answers Trudy. She tells Santa she's in danger and begs for help. Santa checks his scroll and sees she's on the nice list. He tells Trudy not to worry because Santa is coming to town.<br/><br/>So what if Bad Santa, John Wick, and Kevin McCallister worked together to stop the murderous Wet Bandits? Well, watch this movie and find out. The audience knows this is the real Santa at the beginning, but he has issues. And his skull-crushing origin story tells the darkness behind the red suit. This movie isn't for the faint of heart. It's for the Die Hard Christmas fans that want to break out of the Christmas rom-com rut. The fight scenes are stellar, and the Christmas magic isn't sappy or clich√©. Step away from the ordinary and have a blood-and-guts Christmas.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In Chicago, Illinois, Mamie walks into a department store with new shoes to find her son, Emmett, looking at wallets. Emmett pleads to get the wallet with a woman's picture inside. Mamie agrees to buy Emmett the wallet for his vacation to Money, Mississippi. Before he goes, Mamie warns Emmett that the rules in Mississippi are different than in Chicago. He must be on his best behavior, not anger white people, and remain small.<br/><br/>As Emmett boards the train with his Uncle Preacher and his cousins, Mamie worries because this two-week vacation is the longest they have ever been apart. In Money, Emmett plays around while his cousins work the cotton fields. They stop at a local store to hang out and get some refreshments. Emmett goes inside, buys two pieces of gum, gives the cashier, Carolyn, the money, and compliments her. Emmett's cousins see Carolyn run for her gun, so they get into their cars and drive away. Two men come into Preacher's home and threaten him at gunpoint to hand over Emmett. They load Emmett onto the flatbed and have Carolyn confirm Emmett's identity. As several men hold Emmett down, they take him away.<br/><br/>In Chicago, Mamie gets a call from Uncle Preacher saying that Emmett is missing. Then, a friend comes in because a reporter called her with the news. Police found Emmett's body in a river, and he is dead. After fighting with Mississippi, Mamie meets Emmett's body at the same train station she waved goodbye to him. She falls apart.<br/><br/>Mamie and Gene meet the mortician, and Mamie demands to see Emmett's remains. The mortician suggests making Emmett look better, but Mamie tells the mortician that Emmett is perfect. She goes outside to the awaiting media and makes a call to action. Mamie decides to have a public viewing of Emmett, so everyone will know what happened and light a fire under Mississippi to charge the men responsible. This act is the first step of Mamie becoming a civil rights activist and sharing a mother's pain for future generations.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just about Emmett's injustice. It's about the pain, scrutiny, and humiliation Mamie suffered while bravely sitting and testifying during Emmett's murder trial. The director made a bold choice not to show Emmett's murder. However, viewers get a full devastating view of the aftermath. Everything, from hair to clothes to eyewear, was spot on for the period and backed up by photographs. Listen carefully to the news reports in the background. They report about the lynching of Reverand George Washington Lee and his verdict. While Emmett is in Mississippi, you see that Mamie has a nagging feeling that clinches around her. That feeling only a parent knows. This movie will move you to tears and shock you as Mamie gets assistance from T. R. M. Howard, Medgar Evers, and Myrlie Evers and ushers in the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was the first self-governed city of its kind. However, King Anh-Kot enslaved the people and forced them to look for Eternium. He wanted to use the crystal to create the Crown of Sabbac. When a slave finds the crystal, the other people descend upon him. A boy tells them to back off because they shouldn't fight amongst themselves. The boy runs away with the Eternium and starts an uprising. The king kills the boy to make an example of him, but the gods save him and give him the power of Shazam. The boy, now Teth Adam, returns to save Kahndaq, but the king has the crown. They have a battle that destroys the once-luxurious city.<br/><br/>Today, the people of Kahndaq live under the rule of the Inter Gang. Amon learned from his mother, Adrianna, that Inter Gang pillages their resources and pollutes their land while oppressing the people. Karim waits in the truck as Adrianna, Ishmael, and Samir explore the caves. Adrianna finds the crown, but Inter Gang comes in with guns. With a gun to her head, Adrianna tells the troops she will surrender the crown. However, she reads the inscription on the ground and summons Teth Adam. Teth Adam kills all but one of the Inter Gang troops and saves Karim and Adrianna. The surviving troop loads an Eternium-powered rocket and shoots Teth Adam. It injures him, and Adrianna brings Teth Adam and the crown home.<br/><br/>Teth Adam's presence alerted Amanda Waller, who calls Hawkman to capture Teth Adam and imprison him. He called Doctor Fate, a man who can read the future and perform sorcery with the magical Helmet of Fate. Next, Hawkman reached out to Atom Smasher. The last member of the team is Cyclone, and she is a tornado with a 167 IQ. The newly-formed JSA flies to Kahndaq to stop Teth Adam. Yet, Teth Adam isn't their only problem. They have a deadlier force looking for the crown, and they are willing to die and kill for it. It is their birthright.<br/><br/>Congratulations to DC for making the first adult superhero movie viewers can see. Teth Adam is one of the deadliest superheroes or antiheroes the D.C.E.U. has produced. Most of the CGI is well done and flows naturally with the script. However, the smaller Adam is distracting because the head is comically too big for the body. For viewers, being at the beginning sets up most of the surprises. The dialogue and slow-motion scenes have great comedic timing and accurately display everyone's strengths. This movie has one mid-credit sequence but no post-credits. Also, it sets up the future of the D.C.E.U. and is worth watching.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1823 West Africa, the Agojie of the Dahomey Kingdom returned from a fierce battle with their captured people and prisoners from Migan's tribe. King Ghezo instructs his people not to look at the Agojie. General Nanisca stands in front of trainees and tells them the rules of joining her elite warriors. Among the trainees is Nawi. Nawi's father tried to force her to marry an older man, but the man slapped her when she wouldn't speak to him. Nawi's father dragged her to Ghezo's palace and gave Nawi to Ghezo.<br/><br/>Ghezo and one of his wives sit in front of his council and discuss the future of Dahomey. Nanisca warns the king that trading prisoners into slavery for western weapons will weaken Africa. Another advisor tells the king that selling their enemies into slavery will strengthen their kingdom.<br/><br/>Migan enters Dahomey for Ghezo's tribute to the Oyo Empire. His kingdom controls the port Dahomey needs to keep the slave trade. Migan notices that the tribute is short and tells Ghezo that he wants 20 Agojie to make up for the shortfall. Instead of giving Migan 20 warriors, Nanisca declares war. Migan believes the Dahomey kingdom is getting bolder. So, he entices other tribes and western slavers to band together to bring them down. Nanisca will need to look her horrific past in the face to defeat the oncoming attack.<br/><br/>This movie is a warrior's tale with bits of history thrown into the plot. Viewers should use this film as a starting point to do more research on the Dahomey kingdom and the Oyo Empire. Within the story, viewers get revenge, love, jealousy, and excellent choreography. The astounding details on costumes, hair, and makeup are unforgettable. However, there is an audible difference between native African speakers and those from other countries. The flip in tone and dialect can be distracting.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bri's father, Lawless, is a rap legend in Garden Heights, and she aspires to be a rapper like him. However, he died when she was a baby. Her aunt, Pooh, got Bri a spot at The Ring, a rap arena owned by DJ Hype. Bri sells candy at school to classmates to help her mom. Her friends, Malik and Sonny, believe Bri has what it takes to make it in the music industry.<br/><br/>At her first rap battle, Bri's opponent remarks about her father and mother. Bri can't shake the feeling, so she chokes and leaves The Ring. When an officer sees Bri take something out of her bag and exchange it for money, he demands to see her bookbag. Bri refuses, so the officer grabs her and slams her to the floor. Teachers say Bri is aggressive, but Jay wants to know if the SROs will suffer consequences. The principal says the SROs behavior was inexcusable, but the principal will suspend Bri for a week during the investigation.<br/><br/>Bri uses the time to write more rhymes and gets another shot at The Ring. This time, Bri defeats a locally known rapper, Milez, and Milez's father, Supreme, takes notice. Supreme managed her father until the day Lawless died, but Pooh tells Bri to stay away from Supreme. Pooh and Bri go to the parking lot on cloud nine, but their good mood dissipates when they see Pooh's friend in an altercation with a rival gang. Pooh pulls out a gun and refuses to back down, so the gang leaves.<br/><br/>Pooh and Bri return to The Ring for the next battle, but DJ Hype bans Pooh and Bri for bringing a weapon. Instead of leaving, Bri battles a rapper in the parking lot and wins. In desperation, Bri messages Supreme on Instagram. Bri gets in the booth, but producers hate her single. So she makes a song talking about the rival gang, her family, and the SROs. This song will be Bri's first hit, but she doesn't understand that it's a statement that will anger the streets, her family, and her school.<br/><br/>Based on On the Come Up by Angie Thomas, this movie is a coming-of-age story with prose. This film, at first, feels like 8 Mile, but winning the battle isn't the story's goal. Bri has to find her voice and fight through the pain. She must thrive, not just survive. Bri learns the power of song, its effect on others, and the perils of playing the role. In the end, Bri finds her voice using her pain and stands up for herself and her family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Her mother, Queen Ramonda, is fighting a political war with the United Nations. She will never share vibranium until the world is trustworthy. Ramonda returns home to make Shuri take part in a ritual. One year after a loved one passes, you burn your funeral ceremonial robe to honor them and relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>Shuri goes to the water's edge and watches Ramonda throw her robe into the fire, but Shuri refuses. Then, they notice a man coming from the water with wings on his ankles. Ramonda and Shuri dawn spears and demand to know who he is and why he speaks to them. He says his allies call him K'uk'ulkan, but his enemies say Namor. He says that Wakanda exposed his kingdom, Talokan, to great danger when they revealed the secret of vibranium. An American scientist was able to build a device that could detect the presence of the material. They want the Wakandans to bring them the American scientist so they can kill her, or they will destroy Wakanda.<br/><br/>Okoye decides to track down Agent Ross to reveal the location of the American scientist, and she convinces Ramonda to let Shuri go with her to get Shuri out of the lab. They unapologetically convince RiRi to come to Wakanda to keep her safe from a threat of unknown strength. However, Okoye and Shuri encounter hostile agents during their RiRi rescue, and Talokan warriors kidnap two of the women. Now, K'uk'ulkan gives Wakanda two options. One: Join his fight to destroy the land dwellers before they destroy his homeland for their resources. Or two: He will drown Wakanda and everyone in it.<br/><br/>And that's act one of this gut-wrenching, exciting, and loving tribute to Marvel's beloved king. The opening scene and the title card will have everyone in tears as it pays homage to a worthy figure in life and the comics. Then the plot introduces viewers to a new world with stunning but somewhat realistic imagery. You can see how this world mirrors Wakanda. Shuri and K'uk'ulkan are two sides of the same coin. They are children dealing with generational pain and devastating loss in a homeland under constant threat. RiRi is the new kid on the block. She swears, is an open book, and, while a bit naive, has some trust issues. It should go without saying, but the costumes, makeup, and art are second to none and help you delve deeper into this history-rich mythical world. Stay for the mid-credit scene, but their isn't an end-credit scene.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Tom attempts to get closer to Jesse, but Jesse keeps his guard up. Until Tom offers Jesse a ride home because Jesse's car broke down. Tom meets Jesse's wife, Daisy, and their daughter, Pam. Daisy invites Tom in for a beer. She worries because the U.S. government gave the airmen their first mission. They will lend air support to the Korean War. Pam makes Tom promise to watch over Jesse. A new aircraft, some backward attitudes, and heavy firefights will test Tom's devotion to his promise.<br/><br/>Based on Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice by Adam Makos, this movie stands out from other historical tellings because there isn't a bad guy. Although Jesse receives media attention for his race and naval status, he doesn't want that to define him. Only his dedication to the country. Tom is a true definition of an ally. He quickly points out others' wrongdoings and listens to Jesse with an ear of compassion, not pity.

Instead of working on the updated Pet, Gemma and her team, Tess and Cole, keep working on the Model 3 Generative Android, M3gan, for short. Gemma tries a simple demo, but the doll's face melts. David leaves the room enraged and demands Gemma scrap M3gan and begin working on a cheaper Pet. Then Gemma gets a phone call from the hospital in Oregon. Her sister, Ava, and brother-in-law, Ryan, died in a car accident, but their daughter, Cady, survived.<br/><br/>Gemma moves Cady into her home but doesn't have toys, books, or a dedicated space for Cady. Cady comes into Gemma's workshop and shows Gemma her drawings. So, Gemma shows Cady a robot she made in college, Bruce. It's a motion caption robot using gloves to interact. Cady comments that it's a cool toy and the only one she would ever need. Gemma, Tess, and Cole work overtime to fix M3gan.<br/><br/>They invite David to a private meeting and have him watch M3gan interact with Cady. David loves M3gan and wants to present it to the board immediately. Gemma thinks the bond will help Cady recover after losing her parents, allow her to work, and put her company at number one. She wants Cady to be happy, the same as M3gan. Only M3gan will kill for it because Gemma forgot rule number one of toy designing: parental controls.<br/><br/>While Chucky starts creepy, M3gan is a lifesize Barbie on steroids. In true Blumhouse fashion, this script is funny, scary, and twisted. And it sets itself apart from other AI and doll movies because it discusses attachment theory. Cady becomes frighteningly dependent on M3gan and physically attacks Gemma when she can't have M3gan. While we are nowhere near this level of AI, Cady's misplaced attachment is the real threat in society today. Audiences will cringe, laugh, and OMG as M3gan takes over. This film is definitely worth a watch and discussion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

The humans left Spider behind because he was too young to go into cryostasis. He is the son of Colonel Miles and loves to be in the Pandora rainforest with Jake and his family instead of other humans. Jake and Neytiri have four children, Neteyam, Kiri, Lo'ak, and Tuk.<br/><br/>During date night, Jake and Neytiri notice an extra star in the sky. The humans are back. They create a massive fireball to destroy several habitats. However, Jake prepared the Na'vi, and they are battle ready. Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak go to Jake and Miles's last battle site. They find Na'vi in full camouflage and guns. The humans cloned Na'vi bodies and implanted a person's personality and memories in the bodies. Now, Colonel Miles is a walking Na'vi Trojan horse.<br/><br/>After a standoff between Jake and Miles, Miles takes Spider, and Jake runs with his kids. Staying will bring more devastation to her people, so they must leave their life behind. Jake and his family travel to the water and meet with Tonowari. He leads the reef people of Metkayina with his wife, Ronal, by his side. Jake and his family must learn the way of the water to survive on the reef. And they need to study it quickly. Cloning Na'vi isn't the only thing humans desire. However, Miles's need for revenge is his driving force to hunt Jake and his entire family with a captive Spider assisting.<br/><br/>The sequel to Avatar expands the cinematic world by introducing the reef people. Viewers get new animals, plant life, and customs in this new environment. This movie has a lengthy running time, but it doesn't feel 3 hours long. The audience is so immersed in the scenes and culture that you don't mind. The animators did a magnificent job blending real people with motion-capture characters. The moment Tonowari and Ronal discuss Jake and his family staying is the best-animated scene, and it had zero words. Tonowari and Ronal give each other stern looks, loving eyes, and a plea. You will laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer throughout the movie. This film goes beyond what fans expect and is worth the 13-year wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Otto isn't happy to be alive. Instead, he is upset that you can't find decent material these days. Otto doesn't see the point of living without Sonya, and Otto will try again to end it. However, the neighborhood he pushed away will unknowingly come to his rescue, and he theirs.<br/><br/>Based on A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman and a remake of A Man Called Ove, this movie weaves humor and sadness expertly. Otto is a grumpy, older man screaming at the changing of the times in the beginning. However, you get to know his story during each attempt. Otto's cantankerous behavior is valid, although misdirected. If you cried at the beginning of Up, be prepared to have your tissues ready. This film will stay with you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
