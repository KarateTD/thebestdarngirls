  "review":"Rookie, Valerie Young, and her riding partner, Sergeant Mitchell, drop their lunch break for a rowdy fight outside a casino. When Young tries to get a handle on the situation, a man sucker-punches her.  She tases the man, and Young and Mitchell take him to the police station.  The man is Teddy Murretto, and he will be in lock up for a while.  Later, Mitchell gets a call about an abandoned unmarked police cruiser with bullet holes on the side of the road.  As the cops investigate the scene, a drunk driver hits the car and almost kills the cops. They book him as John Doe and put him into another holding cell.  After a throat-closing incident, Young comes down to check on the men.  She finds out that Teddy is a con-man that chose to get locked up to keep himself safe.  However, this was an ill-calculated move.  Across from John Doe, Teddy recognizes the man.  His real name is Bob Viddick, and he is a contract killer.  Viddick got himself locked up to complete the contract on Teddy.  Before the night is over, Young will have to decide who she can trust: a professional, a psychopath, a crooked cop, or a con-man.<br/><br/>This movie takes a second to get started, but it's necessary to set up all the pieces in the game, like Mouse Trap.  Once all the players, plots, and bullets are in place, the knockdown, drag-out fight begins.  Be aware there are no wasted moments on screen.  The broadcasts, backstories, and jokes have a point to the overall plot. This movie takes its time, but it's worth every second to see these opposing forces battle it out.  Based on the ending, maybe we will get a part two.  Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings",
  "review":"Shaun works as a valet with his best friend, Katy, and any chance they get to lollygag, they take it.  They talk on the bus about their futures and their family's expectations.  A man approaches Shaun and tells Shaun to give him his pendant.  Shaun refuses, and the gang of men fight.  With unstable motion, the bus knocks out the driver.  Katy gets into the driver's seat during the fight.  Together, Katy and Shaun save the passengers and fight off the men.  But they take Shaun's pendant.  He tells Katy that he has to find his sister, Xialing, and save her from their father, Wenwu.  This detail stuns Katy because she never knew Shaun had any family.  He tells Katy that he is getting on the next flight to see Xialing, and Katy doesn't hesitate to go with him.  On the flight, Shaun explains that his name is Shang-Chi.  And love, pain, and revenge blanket his family history.  For thousands of years, Wenwu grew power exponentially thanks to the ten rings he found or stole, depending on which legend you believe.  Then, Wenwu learned of a forest called Ta Lo with mythical creatures that possessed unknown strength.  He travels to Ta Lo and finds a beautiful woman, Jiang Li.  Jiang Li protects Ta Lo and all its strength.  The two fell in love and tried to stay in Ta Lo, but they ex-communicated Jiang Li and stripped her of her powers.  After Jiang Li died, Wenwu raised Shang-Chi to be an assassin while developing the ten rings gang.  When Shang-Chi turned 16, Wenwu asked Shang-Chi to avenge his mother.  Shang-Chi left and never came back.  Now, Shang-Chi must save his sister before Wenwu comes for her.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the synopsis because there is still more story to go.  The brief overview is only 30 minutes into the movie.  This movie separates itself with a storyline that doesn't focus on good or evil but grief and loss.  In the beginning, everything is more realistic, but as the story delves deeper into Ta Lo, it becomes more magical, like Dr. Strange.  The graphics are the best yet for the MCU, and the bus fight scene is one of the best. It puts Captain Marvel and Spider-Man to shame.  And let's never forget the fight between Wenwu and Jiang Li.  Their combative dance of love and power is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

As Ellie looks at Sandie's life through Sandie's eyes, Ellie is envious of Sandie's tenacity.  When she learns the path Sandie's life spiraled into, Ellie stands outside of Sandie's body. Being on the outside allowed Ellie to be more critical of Sandie instead of admiring her. The film transports you when Ellie flashes back to Sandie's life. And the edits between Sandie and Ellie are flawless.  When Sandie's end comes across the scene, it will be a poetic justice you were not expecting.  While the film does feel long and has an unnecessary romance, it is highly entertaining and will make you want to do a double-take.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

In an outburst, Gunther says something that makes Jimmy turn around.  Gunther dreamed of a sci-fi play with Clay Calloway as the star.  No one has seen Clay since his wife died. Jimmy agrees to back the show and gives Buster 3 weeks to put it together.  The star, Rosita, needs to make a big dive in her performance.  But she is afraid of heights.  During a progress check, Jimmy's daughter, Porsha, shows Rosita how to do it.  Porsha demands to be the star, and Jimmy makes Buster do it.  But Porsha can't act.  Buster's final hurdle is Clay.  Buster and Ash go to talk to him, but Clay says no.  Ash can see how much Clay is hurting.  So she tells Buster to leave, and she will continue to help Clay take the stage.  After he downgrades Porsha, can Buster pull off the show of his career?<br/><br/>The sequel to Sing has all the laughs and foot-tapping music of the first movie.  But it doesn't have the same inspiring premises as its predecessor.  Also, the funniest moments are in the trailer.  With these few negatives, the movie still entertains with current and original songs.  This sequel makes the film feel final, so it's doubtful they will create a part three.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
