    "review": "A realtor walks a newlywed couple, Al and Rose Young, around a house and shows them the large dining room, living room, and kitchen. She states the price is $3400, and Al gags. He only expected to pay $3000. However, the realtor states Al's G.I. bill will help them. Before Al ponders further, Rose says she's pregnant. Al chooses to buy the home.<br/><br/>Rose gives birth to Richard and has two more children, Jimmy and Elizabeth. Years later, Richard brings his girlfriend, Margaret, home to meet his parents. Rose pats Margaret's hand, stands up, and tells her to focus on her dreams because time won't wait. Richard asks Margaret to spend the night here. She wants to spend the rest of her life here. 'Here' has been many things to many people.<br/><br/>Based on Here by Richard McGuire, this movie's plot centers on the Young family. However, the timeline stretches from prehistoric days until now. The scenes overlay like photos in a scrapbook during pivotal moments to make the connection. The camera doesn't change angles until the last 10 seconds. This spot has a place in history and with each family. It goes through birth, life, and death. This director and editor stayed faithful to the source material and made the movie identical to the graphic novel. This picture isn't for you if you don't like a nonlinear story. This movie will be in film classes for years to come.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Joker: Folie à Deux",
    "review": "The guards at Arkham Asylum give Arthur Fleck a clean shave and suit before he meets his lawyer, Maryanne Stewart. Maryanne prepares Arthur for a conference with his court-appointed psychologist. The psychologists believes Arthur has a split personality that he calls Joker after suffering years of abuse. If they can get the court to accept it, Arthur will spend his life in a mental facility instead of a prison for murdering five people. The guards lead Arthur to B-ward, and he hears singing. Arthur peeks inside and glances at a beautiful woman with an angelic voice. Arthur finishes his psychiatric evaluation, but Maryanne knows this strategy is a long shot. Arthur goes back to his cell. During yard time, a guard, Jackie, got Arthur some time in the B-ward's music class. Arthur can't contain his excitement.<br/><br/>Arthur sits next to the woman. She tells him her name is Lee. He inspired her. She grew up in the same building as him and had an abusive father. She watched Arthur on The Murray Franklin Show and wanted Arthur to shoot him. Then, he did. That's when Lee felt seen for the first time. The guards pull Arthur away, but he is smitten with Lee.<br/><br/>Arthur watches District Attorney Harvey Dent give a press conference about Arthur's trial. Judge Herman Rothwax deemed Arthur fit to stand trial. And Harvey wants Arthur to get the death penalty.<br/><br/>B-ward's music class watches a musical. Lee gets up, walks to the piano, sets it ablaze, and sits in her seat. When people spot the fire, they run. Lee grabs Arthur, and they flee in the other direction. The guards grab Arthur and throw him into the hole until his trial.<br/><br/>One day, Lee awakens Arthur. She bribed a guard to let her into the hole to say goodbye to Arthur. However, she plans to be at Arthur's trial daily. She paints Arthur's face, and they make love in the hole.<br/><br/>Arthur enters the courtroom but looks back at the door during the opening statement. He beams with glee when Lee enters and sits in the back. After the first day of deliberations, Lee confronts Maryanne in the vestibule. Lee thinks Maryanne is mocking the Joker and losing the trial. Lee says the world is on Joker's side and will free him.<br/><br/>Lee goes to the holding cell and tells Joker that Maryanne will lose the trial. Maryanne meets with Arthur about the trial. He professes his love for Lee, and Maryanne laughs. She reveals that Lee is a liar. Her name is Harley Quinzel, and her parents are rich. Arthur confronts Lee about her lies, and she confesses. She lied because she wanted Joker to like her. She wants him to let Joker free. Arthur takes her advice and fires Maryanne. Joker will represent himself and make the world smile. Will he be found guilty and sent to death?<br/><br/>This musical sequel is an ambitious change from the first film. Arthur and Lee perform songs, together and apart, to express their feelings. However, the movie stays grounded when the real world bleeds into the music and dance. The costume designers ensured the world around Arthur was gloomy and gray. But Joker's world had spots of color. The storyline does an excellent job of recapping the first film. The plot slows down for the songs, and sometimes the music drowns out the actors. However, the film is worthwhile. The audience will watch Arthur Fleck's trial and Joker's birth.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Pharrell Williams welcomes a documentary crew into his home. But before he answers questions, he thinks the story should be in Lego. He doesn't feel that anything is new. We take what exists, break it apart, and create something different, just like the classic toy. Then, Pharrell talks about his early connection with music, especially Stevie Wonder. He bonded with the music because Pharrell has synesthesia. He sees and hears the music around him. His grandmother saw his potential. She told him God had a higher purpose for him, bought him a snare drum, and instructed him to join the band. He met Chad, Shay, Pusha T, Missy Elliott, and Timbaland. Pharrell's life will touch the world.<br/><br/>Pharrell was correct. His story could only be in Lego. You see the world through his creative lens. The film doesn't feel like a typical Behind The Music documentary. Each song is a different Lego structure that lights up and bounces when he shows it to others. In case you are wondering, it never changes perspective. The audience stays in the Lego world. Viewers will learn something new about the legendary producer while singing along to his greatest hits. He wants creativity to be celebrated and never boxed in. Parents should know there is some light swearing, but it doesn't dominate the film. Also, some classic music videos get the Lego treatment. This movie is a pure classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Orion Pax sneaks into the Cybertron Archives to find recordings about the Matrix of Leadership. The first Primes died in a battle against the Quintessons, and the Matrix was lost. Since its disappearance, the Energon stopped flowing naturally, and Cybertronians are born without their transformation cog. Without the ability to transform, Energon miners, like Orion, dig below the surface to mine the resource. And their leader, Sentinel Prime, searches the surface for the Matrix. Security guards find Orion and chase him out of the archives. Orion jumps out of a window, and his best friend, D-16, saves him.<br/><br/>D-16 and Orion dig with their co-worker, Jazz, and captain, Elita-1. During their dig, an explosion traps Jazz, and Elita-1 tells Orion and D-16 to leave him and follow protocol. But Orion won't listen. He convinces D-16 to save Jazz. They do, but cause a cave-in. Then, Sentinel Prime makes an announcement. The miners will get the day off for Iacon 5000.<br/><br/>Orion and D-16 walk to the race, and Orion pulls D-16 into a secret entrance. D-16 grins at the starting line until Orion straps a jetpack to their backs. They enter the race and nearly win before losing miserably. However, Sentinel Prime congratulates them for motiving the mining bots. After Sentinel Prime and his second-in-command, Arachnid, leave, a racer furiously barges into the room. They caused him to crash, and he punishes them. He dumps them to level 50.<br/><br/>B-127 can't believe he has guests. Then, B-127 introduces them to his 'friends.' Orion accidentally knocks into B-127's 'friend,' and a chip falls out. It plays a message from Alpha Trion. He is in battle and gives their final location. Orion believes that's where they will find the Matrix. He convinces D-16 and B-127 to come to the surface to find the Matrix. They uncover so much more.<br/><br/>This origin story plays into the best friends becoming mortal enemies cliché but is highly entertaining and feels original. The story has jokes for parents without making sexual innuendos. The film has action and astounding storytelling. Also, they don't force a romantic storyline. This film is about the creation of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. There is one mid-credit scene and one post-credit scene. The graphics could be better, but the story makes up for the visual pitfalls. See this movie with the entire family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Cynthia returns home and summons her son, Isaiah, to the kitchen. He hasn't cleaned his room, taken out the trash, or done his laundry. Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

However, she hears nothing. Moana's parents, Tui and Sina, wait patiently for Moana while her little sister, Simea, runs to her. The village celebrates her return and asks for updates.<br/><br/>Moana takes Simea to the caverns and tells Simea the story about their ancestors - the Wayfinders. Tautai Vasa took his crew to Motufetu Island. But the god Nalo caused a storm that destroyed their canoe. Tui pulls Moana aside. She is the first Wayfinder in generations, and he wants her to accept the title Tautai. Moana humbly takes the title in a ritual. Today, the ancestors want Moana to find Motufetu because it connects people worldwide. Moana wakes and tells her tribe.<br/><br/>Moana prepares to leave, but Sina thinks Moana needs a crew, and Heihei isn't enough. Moana chooses Loto, Kela, and Moni. Moana approaches Moni's tapestry of Maui and whispers for Maui to join her. However, Maui doesn't respond. Moana, Loto, Kela, Moni, Heihei, and Pua travel to find the lost island of Motufetu.<br/><br/>Goddess Matangi holds Maui captive in a secret location. Her boss, God Nalo, is furious with Maui. Maui helped Moana. Nalo knows humans can reunite the people and end his control over the land. A united world would dismantle Nalo's power. Maui tells Matangi that Moana isn't Nalo's problem. Matangi tells Maui that it's too late. Nalo will end Moana. Maui and his tattoo must free themselves and warn Moana to stay away from Motufeto before Matangi and Nalo end the lives of her and her crew.<br/><br/>This sequel expands the island and world of Moana. Moana has friends who help her prepare for her missions. She is a proud chief and Wayfinder. It's best to watch the first movie before seeing the second. The script mentions what happened in the past but doesn't go into great detail. The graphics express the growth of the Disney animation team. The entire theater will light up with their artwork. Children will love the movie. It takes them on a new adventure, focusing on problem-solving, teamwork, and fun. This film has one mid-credit scene, but it's unnecessary to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Some days later, they meet in Nice France, and Jovanna hands Donnie his cover story. He will act as a diamond dealer and use the stolen gems to get access to the World Diamond Center. Donnie funds the operation and collects information about the diamond volt. No one has ever successfully robbed the WDC, and Donnie plans to be the first.<br/><br/>Detective Nick finalized his divorce and custody agreement with his ex-wife in Los Angeles. And he can't get the representatives of the Federal Reserve to admit someone robbed them. Nick grabs Merrimen's girlfriend and threatens her life if she doesn't tell him where Donnie hid the money. She admits the money is in Panama. Only one account catches his eye, and someone has made regular withdrawals from France. Nick flies to France and uses his old U.S. Marshall's badge to gain access to the French police department. The police show Nick footage around the WDC, and Nick spots Donnie on security tapes. However, he tells the police it's not Donnie and leaves the precinct.<br/><br/>Donnie returns to his French apartment after spending time at the WDC. He hears something moving throughout and grabs his gun. Nick is eating a meal and enjoying a drink. He wants to join Donnie's crew and get paid. If Donnie doesn't include Nick, then Nick will arrest Donnie. So Donnie relents. Donnie and Nick think they can rob the WDC and leave without a trace. However, Donnie doesn't know that the diamonds he originally stole belong to a mafia syndicate called Octopus. The leader put a tracker on his diamonds and wants them back now. Can Donnie and Nick complete the heist before the Octopus gets a hold of them?<br/><br/>This sequel, inspired by the Antwerp Diamond Heist, has all the heart-pounding action of the first movie while telling a fresh story. It puts the audience in the middle of the heist with several ticking clocks, low-tech solutions, and high-tech gadgets. And the heist isn't the end of the story. The script recaps the first film, so you don't need to see it to enjoy this picture. There are no mid- or post-credit scenes, but the ending hints at part 3. So be ready to hold your breath and root for the bad guy because this film will take you on a wild ride.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Tom and Maddie revel in the quiet when a beam of light comes from a helicopter. Director Rockwell exits and asks for Team Sonic's help. An alien escaped a private base in Tokyo. And they can't catch him. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles board the helicopter.<br/><br/>Team Sonic lands in Tokyo and can't believe the alien standing before them looks like Sonic. His name is Shadow. Sonic chases after him, but Shadow outsmarts him. The team meets Commander Walters at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Commander Walters explains that Shadow landed on Earth 50 years ago inside a meteorite. They hid him in a top-secret base to study his powers under the guidance of a professor. The professor's granddaughter, Maria, bonded with Shadow and became best friends. Then, an accident at the base took Maria's life. Now that Shadow is free, he wants revenge for Maria.<br/><br/>Hours ago, someone hacked their system and lowered their defenses. Reports state that Dr. Robotnik's symbol emerged on the screen during the hack. Then, Robotnik's drones enter the restaurant and aim for the team after fatally wounding Commander Walters. Walters hands Sonic a key to a powerful weapon. A motorcyclist rides into the restaurant, incapacitates the attack drones, and exits. The team follows the cyclist until he stops. It's Agent Stone. He says someone framed Dr. Robotnik, and he has proof.<br/><br/>Agent Stone takes the team to Dr. Robotnik's lair. When he learns someone stole his tech, Dr. Robotnik chooses to work with Team Sonic to find the culprit. However, he needs something from Sonic. Sonic rolls his eyes and pulls out a quill. This unlikely mash-up must stop Shadow's revenge and keep the key out of the wrong person's hands.<br/><br/>It may be unbelievable, but this film is the best of the trilogy. First, this adventure is worldwide. Second, this film is about the toxic nature of anger and revenge. Third, this movie respects its core audience by referencing old tech, movies, and jokes. However, it doesn't forget its new fans. The movie kept a steady pace while introducing new characters. The plot didn't waste time recapping the last films. This film is an animated action-adventure comedy for the whole family with mid- and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it. This film is an extraordinary watch if you can handle it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Simba runs to find Nala and leaves their daughter, Kiara, with Rafiki, Timon, and Pumbaa. Kiara dreams she could be as strong as her grandfather. Rafiki explains that Mufasa wasn't always a king. Rafiki sits Kiara down and tells the story of her grandfather, Mufasa: The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mufasa and his parents, Afia and Masego, are living through drought. Mufasa's mother, Afia, tells Mufasa that the drought won't last forever. Until then, he should look at the horizon. Beyond the light is a land called Milele. Everything in Milele flows in abundance. Then, the rain falls. Mufasa and his family go to the watering hole with the other animals. Later, they hear a rumble and see a flood. An elephant hits the dam, and the water sweeps Mufasa away.<br/><br/>Mufasa struggles on a branch when a cub, Taka, appears. He is the son of King Obasi and Obasi's mate, Eshe. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him ashore. Eshe tells Taka to leave Mufasa alone because Obasi doesn't like strays. Eshe has compassion for the cub and brings Mufasa to the pride. Obasi wants to eat Mufasa, but Mufasa says he is too fast. Obasi creates Taka's first challenge to prove he can be a king. If Taka beats Mufasa in a race, Obasi will eat Mufasa. If Mufasa wins, then he can stay with their pride. They race, but Eshe sees that Taka lets Mufasa win. Obasi keeps his promise but tells Mufasa he must live with the females.<br/><br/>As Taka and Mufasa grow, their brotherly bond becomes tighter, much to Obasi's displeasure. Taka wants to learn how to hunt like Mufasa, but Obasi says his place is sleeping on a rock, protecting the pride. When Obasi falls asleep, Taka follows Eshe to learn. They hear others approaching but don't have time to escape. Mufasa saves Eshe while Taka runs away.<br/><br/>The remaining white lion returns to the leader, Kiros. With a lowered head, the surviving lion explains that Mufasa killed Kiros's son while saving Eshe. Then, he pledges vengeance for his son.<br/><br/>Mufasa can smell Kiros and his pride coming. Eshe tells Taka and Mufasa to leave and protect each other. Kiros believes there can only be one king. They slaughter Obasi's pride. However, Kiros knows the lion who killed his son isn't there. He orders his pride to track Mufasa and Taka. He vows to kill the pair, avenge his son, and become the king.<br/><br/>This Lion King prequel starts with a tribute to James Earl Jones. Then, it transports the audience to Pride Rock. It's not Mufasa's story alone. It's the tale of two brothers, entitlement, courage, and the king's court. By staying with the pride's females, Mufasa learned lessons that separated him from the others. Mufasa's journey mirrors Simba's. He leaves home for safety and finds friends along the way. The graphics far surpass the live adaptation of The Lion King, and the voice acting is stellar. The music flows wonderfully with the theme, although it drowns out the vocal performances. Also, the backing track makes the room vibrate and crescendos with the sun. This film is an astounding prequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jason Crutchfield trains young men to box at the Berston Field House. Every day, a young girl, Claressa Shields, runs to the gym. One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
