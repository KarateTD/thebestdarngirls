    "mtitle":"Let Him Go",
    "review":"George and Margaret work on their Montana ranch with the help of their son, James, and James's wife, Lorna, and their baby, Jimmy.  Margaret looks outside the window and sees James's horse, but no James.  George finds James dead on a pile of rocks next to a creek.  Three years later, George and Margaret attend Lorna and Donnie Weboy's wedding. A few days later, Margaret sits in her car outside the grocery store and sees Donnie, Lorna, and Jimmy walking while eating ice cream cones.  Then, Donnie laughs at Jimmy because he dropped his ice cream.  When Jimmy refuses Donnie, Donnie hits Jimmy.  Lorna comes to Jimmy's defense, and Donnie hits her too.  They leave.  Margaret doesn't tell George what she saw at the grocery store.  Instead, she makes a cake and takes it to Donnie's home, but the family is gone. Margaret comes home and prepares for a trip.  When George gets home, he knows something is wrong. Margaret believes Lorna can't defend herself and their grandson.  So Margaret will get Jimmy back. George closes his suitcase, and they head down the road.  George and Margaret don't know the Weboy Family is powerful in North Dakota.  The matriarch, Blanche, rules with an iron fist, shotgun, and a lit cigarette. She will never let any of the Weboys walk away again, including Jimmy.<br/><br/>Based on Let Him Go by Larry Watson, this movie is a slow burn but picks up at the end.  Just a warning, some scenes can be pretty gruesome.  But what you are witnessing is three mothers fighting for the boy they love. In the end, it all comes down to Jimmy and how much people are willing to sacrifice to keep him. Viewers get a Kill Bill Vol. 2 moment, and it's worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Kid Detective",
    "review":"As a child, Abe Applebaum had a nose for mysteries.  His principal came to Abe with his first case when Abe was 13.  It was the case of the missing fundraiser money.  Abe picks a suspect, and the principal recovered the money.  Soon, Abe was running a business out of his treehouse, and the police even called to consult him on bigger cases.  When someone chopped down his treehouse, the thankful town got him an office on Main Street.  The mayor's daughter, Grace, was his receptionist, and he paid her with soda.  His business was booming, and Abe was in the newspaper every week, but that all changed when Grace went missing.  The town and Abe expected Abe to find her, but when he couldn't, Abe's town and Abe fell into a depression.  Today, at 32, Abe is self-loathing, solves mediocre mysteries, and has more debt than cases. As he walks home from work, he sees police combing through the river. The police found Caroline's 15-year-old boyfriend stabbed to death in the river, and they have no leads. So, Caroline asks him to find who murdered her boyfriend.  He asks if she is sure because the truth can be shocking.  Caroline is sure and hires Abe.  This murder case will be his first adult case and a chance to clear Grace's case from his soul.<br/><br/>This movie goes from Encyclopedia Brown to 8mm in less than two hours.  It's a mix of Criminal Minds' unsubs with Psych's hijinks and wit.  You will laugh at the inappropriateness of Abe as he hides in a little girl's bedroom after spying on a teenage boy.  This story is perfection because Abe carries the weight of the town on his shoulders, and you can see the moment the weight lifts.  If you have ever gone through a hard time, you will connect with Abe's tears. When Abe finds the murderer, he will learn the truth about his town and himself.  This movie will become a cult classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tom met Annie a year ago at a storage facility where she worked, and he wants to continue his future with her without looking over his shoulder every day.  The FBI knows Tom as the In-and-Out Bandit. Tom buys a house for him and Annie, then he goes to a motel and calls the FBI.  Agent Sam Baker picks up the phone and doesn't believe Tom's story. So, he gives the phone to his partner, Detective Meyers. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million.  He is willing to give it all back if they give him what he wants.  Tom wants to be held for a maximum of two years in a minimum-security prison with full visitation rights.  Meyers still doesn't believe him, so they hand the case to Agent Ramon Hall and Agent Jason Nivens. After meeting Tom, they believe Tom is another liar, so Tom tells them how he committed the crimes.  Tom gives them the location of $3 million.  They go to the storage unit expecting to find nothing.  However, they find the motherload.  John gets an idea.  They can take the money, kill Tom, and tell Baker and Meyers it was all a hoax. Ramon hangs his head and says yes. Ramon and John walk into the hotel room, and John is prepared to kill Tom, but there is a knock at the door.  It's Agent Baker.  Baker walks inside but can tell something is off, then John shoots him point-blank in the head. Tom jumps in Annie's car and drives away.  Tom has to come clean with the woman he loves, clear his name of murder, and peacefully turn himself in before John and Ramon kill him and Annie.<br/><br/>Yes, this is another Liam Neeson kills-everyone movie, but that's why it's fun.  Tom never claims to be perfect or a good guy.  However, he tells everyone he is honest. It's interesting to contrast what drives each pair to fight together.  Tom and Annie find strength through love and the future.  And for Myers, he fights to get justice for Baker and find the person who killed him.  For Ramon and John, their partnership stands on blackmail and money.  Seeing the pairs work together or for each other changes throughout the film, and it will be their downfall or salvation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

During class, the principal calls Joe to the hallway.  They can offer him a full-time teaching position with time off and benefits, no more part-time work for him.  He goes to his mother's tailor shop, and Libba tells him that he must take the job.  Libba wants Joe to have a steady income with benefits, not an unstable gig, so Joe tells Libba he will take the job.  Joe gets a call from Curley, a former student, and Curley is a drummer for Dorothea Williams, a famous local jazz saxophonist.  Dorothea needs a new pianist. Joe runs downtown as fast as he can and meets with Dorothea.  She tells Joe to sit at the piano and join them.  At first, Joe is confused because he doesn't know the song they are playing, but then he gets into a zone.  When he opens his eyes, the band watches in awe.  Dorothea tells him to get a suit, come back at 9 pm tonight, and congratulations.  Joe made the band.  Excited, he runs home, talking on his phone, and falls into an open sewer. Now, Joe is a soul headed to the Great Beyond.  He runs from the Great Beyond, falls off the bridge, and falls into the Great Before.  All the soul counselors introduce themselves as Jerry.  It's their job to give souls their personality, but one spot remains open.  Once the soul fills that spot by going to the Hall of Everything, they get an Earth pass and start their life.  Jerry assumes Joe is a mentor for souls looking for the spark to fill the last spot.  After several failed attempts to return to earth, Joe sees he is not dead but in a coma at the hospital.  Joe decides to pretend to be a mentor and steal an Earth pass to get back.  Jerry assigns Joe to 22. Twenty-two doesn't see the point of living if dying is the result.  Joe and '22' make a promise, if he helps her find her spark, '22' will give Joe her Earth pass.  He will live, and she will never be born.<br/><br/>As usual, Pixar delivers the concept of life, death, and the beyond in a touching, palatable, and beautiful way.  To parents, there are plenty of jokes for you to enjoy.  But one concept that will pull you in is the land of Lost Souls.  Some of these lost souls aren't dead.   They are so focused on one thing that they stopped living their life. Putting an image to this concept will strike a chord with you.  This movie is a film the entire family can enjoy, and it's a strong entry to close out the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She sees a woman picking up papers scattered all over the floor and bends down to help her.  The woman introduces herself as Barbara Minerva, a geologist and gemologist that likes cryptography.  As Diana walks away, Carol walks in looking for Barbara.  While investigating a jewelry store robbery, police uncovered the store was a front for selling black market antiquities.  The FBI will bring the items to the museum for Barbara to analyze.  As Barbara looks over the items, Diana comes to check things out.  They notice a unique looking stone, but it has a marking Barbara can't understand.  Diana recognizes the language and tells Barbara it says hold it and make a wish.  Diana holds it and makes a wish, and then she invites Barbara to an early dinner.  Later, Diana holds the stone on her desk and wishes to be more like Diana.  The next day, Carol brings their latest platinum donor, Max Lord, on a private tour.  He notices the stone in Barbara's office and wants to know more about it, but Barbara stops him.  He invites Barbara and Diana to a party in his honor for his donation. Diana goes to the party looking for Max.  Max finds Barbara and goes to her office to make out.  In the middle of the session, he asks to borrow the stone for a few days, and she says yes.  As Diane searches for Max, a man calls out to her and says, 'I wish we had more time.'  She turns in blistering anger and tells him not to say that.  It slowly sinks in that her wish came true, and Steve's ghost is in another man's body.  She forgets about Max and focuses on Steve.  This focus is a mistake.  Max runs Black Gold Corporation and advertises it on TV, and while it may look successful, it's a ponzi scheme. But he doesn't wish for his company to succeed, but he makes a wish to become the stone. Diana goes to Max's office and finds dust.  She sees a metal ring that once held the stone and sees an engraving on the inside.  The stone came from the God of Lies. He is granting wishes for his gain.  Diana must find and destroy him before Max destroys the world.<br/><br/>Sequel to Wonder Woman, this movie has all the hair, shoulder pads, and greed of the 1980s.  Many who have seen this movie complain it doesn't have a villain.  But they fail to realize, in the 1980s, greed was at an all-time high. So, greed is the ultimate villain.  The fight scenes are well choreographed and framed perfectly for each shot.  And let's mentions Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  The look on his face is priceless. It does help to see the first movie to catch the little tidbits from the first.  With all the strong points, the film runs too long.  The romance between Steve and Diana takes up too much time. Some of the CGI turns the movie into a cartoon and takes away from the viewing experience.  This movie is watchable for those willing to enjoy a DC movie, not a DC movie compared to Marvel.  And stay after the first end-credits for a blast-from-the-past cameo.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
