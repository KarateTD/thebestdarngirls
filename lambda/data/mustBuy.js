    "review":"Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, hide among the Freman people in the desert as word of their death travels through the houses. Stilgar pulls Jessica aside because he and other southern Freman believe Paul is there to fulfill the prophecy. A Reverand Mother is dying, and they want Jessica to take her place. Jessica says yes and goes through the deadly ritual but doesn't tell them she's pregnant. With her new status, Jessica will convince non-believing Freman that Paul is the Messiah.<br/><br/>Paul desires to learn the ways of the Freman. Stilgar gladly teaches Paul, and southern Freman delights in Paul's triumphs. However, a northern Freman, Chani, isn't impressed. She doesn't subscribe to the prophecy because she thinks it's an enslavement tool. Paul confides in Chani about his apocalyptic dreams as the two become inseparable. Paul's dreams warn that traveling to Southern Arrakis will bring death to billions.<br/><br/>Glossu Rabban Harkonnen sends spice harvesters and soldiers to the northern part of the Arrakis. Since the death of Duke Leto, Baron Vladimir Harroken wants his nephew, Glossu, to regain control of spice production. Vladimir thinks Glossu is a doting foot soldier but doesn't believe Glossu is ready to lead. Vladimir wants his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha, to take the throne. Emperor Shaddam IV's Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam, agrees. Shaddam's daughter, Princess Irulan, disagrees because Feyd-Rautha is a psychopath. Irulan keeps a secret. She suspects that Paul and Jessica are alive but unsure of their location. Can Paul and the Fremans stop the Harroken with the Emperor and his people secretly working for them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Dune by Frank Herbert and the sequel to Dune, this film deserves the most vivid screen and best sound an audience can find. The graphics are extraordinary and clean. The sound gives the script a proper build for its iconic moments. The story is captivating and dramatic. The script doesn't force its high-level wit on you and profoundly uses silence. On this surface, this movie is about empires fighting over a resource. However, this plot gently discusses religion and looting. This sequel is better than the first film and deserves your time and money. Its stunning fight scenes, jaw-dropping graphics, and compelling storyline are worth the running time.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Doris asks Jack how much the new Cadillac attached to their mobile home costs. Jack tells Doris he has to look like the NWA champion to get the belt. Doris prays for guidance in the front seat. Doris believes God will protect the family from the Von Erich Curse, but Jack thinks it's professional wrestling.<br/><br/>Years later, Jack runs WCCW promotion with his son, Kevin, at the top of the card. Jack and Doris's other sons, Kerry, Mike, and David, beam with pride at Kevin's in-ring accomplishments. Jack lets his sons know he has favorites in a particular order, but they are subject to change.

Jack announces it's David's time to get into the squared circle and tag with Kevin.<br/><br/>Kerry returns home after the U.S. pulls out of the Olympics. Jack adds Kerry to the family business and makes Kevin, Kerry, and David compete in 6-man tag team matches. After the Von Erichs battle, Jack announces that David will go for the NWA championship. Kevin knows he has gone down a rank on Jack's list. The Von Erichs will fight to be at the top of Jack's list and the wrestling world while fighting the family curse.<br/><br/>This movie is a stunning tribute to the Von Erichs by bringing their story to a peaceful end. The casting was top-notch, and the actors embodied their roles. You can sense the deep love these brothers had for one another. The director overlays the brothers in the locker room, and viewers see their similar struggles and suffering. It's unbelievable that one family went through so much tragedy.

The Monarch has several outposts on the Earth's surface and one on Hallow Earth. On the surface, Godzilla battles other Titans attacking the Earth. As Godzilla rests in the Colosseum, a scientist pulls Dr. Ilene aside to examine the latest signals. Others want to dismiss them, but the readings are too steady.<br/><br/>Ilene's daughter, Jia, became distracted in class and drew the same symbols on her paper and desk. Jia informs Ilene that something from Hallow Earth is calling her. Ilene looks closer at Jia's drawings and realizes they match the signals. Ilene takes the information to Bernie for help.<br/><br/>Bernie runs the Titan Truth podcast and posts about his work saving the world. Ilene asks Benie to look over the signals. The signals are a distress call from Hallow Earth and could cause Kong and Godzilla to collide again. Ilene rests until she hears that Kong is coming to the surface. She will travel to the Hallow Earth Access Point to stop Kong and take him back. And Bernie insists on going and filming the events for his podcast.<br/><br/>Bernie and Ilene arrive at the Access Point, and Jia walks to the observation deck. Kong rises to the shore, and Ilene spots the damaged tooth. Trapper, the Titan veterinarian, sedates Kong, removes the tooth, and implants a new one. While Kong relaxes on the shore, Godzilla collects power from nuclear plants worldwide. Ilene believes Godzilla is charging himself for round two. They must bring Kong to Hallow Earth and find the source of this signal before Kong and Godzilla battle again. Dr. Ilene, Trapper, Bernie, and Jia will open the door to a world undiscovered for thousands of years and awaken a monster that can bring forth the second ice age. Can they save the world for humans and the Titans?<br/><br/>This movie is proof that 2024 is the year of the sequels. Godzilla x Kong doesn't disappoint its core audience. It builds on the existing storyline while expanding its world and adding new Titans. The writers understand that viewers want action and stunning graphics. So, they deliver. The CGI team allowed Kong to have emotions without looking too human. They created the other animals and Titans beautifully. The fight scenes between Titans are astounding and equally comical. While the movie is action-packed, the overall theme is discovering where you belong. See this movie if you loved Godzilla vs. Kong. Also, watch it if you didn't. It is a fun time for everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Two hold her down while another injects Abigail with a sedative.<br/><br/>They arrive at their destination and put Abigail into a bedroom. The negotiator, Lambert, tells them to keep Abigail alive for 24 hours while he extorts her father for money. One of the kidnappers asks what they should call each other if they can't exchange names. So, Lambert gives them code names. The sedative injector is Joey. The hacker is Sammy, while the muscle is Peter. Dean is the driver, and Rickles is the weapons expert. Frank rounds out the crew with his short temper. Lambert reminds everyone that Joey is the only person allowed to communicate with Abigail and leaves.<br/><br/>Joey visits Abigail. Abigail fears they will hurt her, but Joey pinky-promises they won't. Then, Abigail warns Joey they made a mistake. Abigail says her father doesn't care about her.<br/><br/>The team splits for the night, and Dean goes to the kitchen. Then, something grabs and decapitates him. Sammy finds Dean's body and screams. Frank barges into Abigail's room and demands her father's name. Frank runs to the team and panics because Abigail's father is Kristof Lazar. Rickles knows the lore surrounding the legendary crimelord and decides to leave. Then, something kills Rickles. Frank wants to kill Abigail. He runs to her room with a gun, but Joey stops him after remembering her pinky promise. While they argue, Sammy notices Abigail remove her restraints with ease. Then Abigail transforms into a dancing vampire. She is Kristof's hitwoman, and she will make them pay. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This movie is a bloody, funny mystery with a brilliant ensemble. It's not a traditional horror movie, but it provides entertaining jump scares. The script takes a while to reveal Abigail's powers. It's necessary because it allows the viewers to connect with each character. While the crew makes typical horror mistakes, they get some actions correct. If you like M3GAN, this film is for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

After engineering class, Joe's friend, Roger, tells him the rowing team will pay crew members and offer housing. Coach Al Ulbrickson introduces the men to the other coaches, including Coach Thomas Bolles and the boatbuilder George Pocock. The coaches will decide who will join the varsity and junior varsity 8-men teams.<br/><br/>After a grueling tryout, Al picks Joe, Roger, and the other men. The president says they need to win, and he can ask the former students for more money. But winning one race isn't enough. They need to win gold at the Olympics. After the JV team races in the regatta and beat the best time ever by seconds, Al gets an unorthodox idea. Instead of sending the varsity team to compete in Poughkeepsie, he can send JV. The president, donors, and varsity team angrily erupt after Al's announcement. However, he won't budge. Can the JV team prove Al right by making it to the Olympics and winning gold?<br/><br/>Based on The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics by Daniel James Brown, this film focuses on Al, Joe, and their obstacles. Al went with his gut and made an unpopular choice. And he suffered along the way for it. Each time the team hit a new impossible milestone, someone moved the goalpost. Joe raised himself since he was 14. He has to learn how to depend on others and become one.

    "review":"After Professor Dr. Thelonious 'Monk' Ellison rages at another student, the school advisors think he should take some time off to focus on his upcoming book and spend time with his family. Monk hasn't sold a novel in years, and several publishers turned down his latest manuscript. Another publisher turned down Monk's work because it wasn't 'black enough.' Monk thinks that's ridiculous. Monk returns to Boston and attends a book festival, but the crowd is thin. Another author explains that everyone is at the session for Sinatra Golden. Monk quietly enters her session and becomes sickened by her book, 'We's Lives in Da Ghetto.' He thinks her book appeals to the lowest demographic and panders to stereotypes. Later, Monk visits his sister, OB GYN Dr. Lisa, at work, and she drives him to their mother's home. They enjoy a night out with Agnes.<br/><br/>Monk and Lisa meet for lunch, and she warns him that Agnes's health is declining. Monk asks if their brother, Plastic Surgeon Dr. Cliff, will help, but he is in dire straits emotionally and financially since his divorce. Then, the unimaginable happens. Now, Monk has to come up with the money to care for Agnes. So, he sits and writes a book called 'My Pafology' with all the racial stereotypes and sends it to Arthur under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh.<br/><br/>Monk gets a phone call from a gleeful Arthur in the morning. A publishing company offered Monk $750,000 for his book. Monk can't believe it and rejects the offer because the book goes against everything he believes. Arthur reminds Monk Agnes needs help. Monk staggers to yes. Monk thinks this deal is one-and-done. However, Leigh's rise could trigger Monk's downfall.<br/><br/>Based on Erasure by Percival Everett, this movie bravely acknowledges issues in literature while defending it. Companies love to shine a light on black voices but only tell the stories of violence and slavery. However, companies shouldn't ignore or overlook these stories either. This plot gives the viewer a glimpse into the writer's process and multiple endings. Also, this movie makes the most uncomfortable moments hilarious. Don't let preconceived notions stop you from seeing this film. It's for everyone. So, do you believe Monk is a sell-out, or does the ends justify the means?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Bob Marley: One Love",
    "review":"In 1976, Bob Marley and the Wailers met with reporters about their upcoming free concert in Jamaica. Some say that Bob's concert will strengthen the divide, but Bob maintains that he isn't picking a side. He wants to bring everyone peacefully together.<br/><br/>Bob plays with his friends and family and travels to practice before the concert. Bob's wife, Rita, sings background vocals but leaves to take care of things before the show. Rita sees several men approaching the house with guns. Before she can warn Bob and the band, a man shoots her in the head. The men run inside and shoot anyone moving. Bob and Rita survive their wounds and perform the concert two days later. He tells Rita to take the children and stay with Rita's mother in America while he records his next album in London. Soon, Bob wants to perform in Africa, but Rita worries his pursuits are pulling focus away from Jamaica. After financial disputes, domestic issues, and health problems, Bob will discover that delivering the message isn't enough. He has to become the message.<br/><br/>This film only covers a few years of Marley's life in detail. The documentary doesn't try to glamorize Bob or paint him as a hero. They allow the audience to see his motivation, artistic process, and determination. Also, it props up Rita's involvement in Bob's personal and professional life. Viewers will learn more about the man, his music, and his relationships.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire",
    "review":"After capturing the Hell's Kitchen's Dragon Ghost, the Ghostbusters - Gary, Callie, Trevor, and Phoebe - meet with Mayor Walter Peck. Mayor Peck threatens to charge Gary and Callie with child labor crimes if they don't bench Phoebe. They return home to extract the ghost from the trap, but the containment unit takes a while to go green. Gary and Phoebe start to worry if the containment unit has enough room.<br/><br/>Nadeem enters Dr. Ray Stantz's store with several of his grandmother's items, looking for a quick buck. At first, nothing catches Ray's eye until he picks up a bronze orb covered in ancient glyphs. Ray scans it with a PKE meter, and it violently vibrates. The orb causes the wall around the containment unit to crack. Dr. Winston takes them to his secret lab. He has a containment unit several times larger than the one in the Ghostbuster's basement. Intern Lucky and Lars try to extract the ghost from the orb, but it protects itself with a layer of freezing ice.<br/><br/>They take the orb to a linguistic specialist, Dr. Hurbert Wartzki. He recognizes it from wall carvings in ancient tombs. It houses a ghostly deity, Garraka, who worked alongside a king to expand the king's empire. Garraka rose and started to freeze the world around him. A group known as the Fire Masters trapped Garraka in the bronze orb to protect the world from his wrath. The Ghostbusters must find a fire master to trap and destroy Garraka for good. If not, Garraka will raise a ghost army, bring forth the second ice age, and end humankind.<br/><br/>This sequel starts with a Robert Frost poem and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. It has jokes for older and newer fans of the franchise. While the script packs action in most scenes, the encompassing theme is family. The elder team reunites to help save the world. The current Ghostbusters are finding their groove as a blended family. Also, the Spengler kids are asserting their independence. Parents should be careful. The plot mentions a sex dungeon and hookers once. Also, it has one mid-credit scene. This film is intriguing, suspenseful, heartfelt, and funny.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
