    "review": "Before this review begins, there will be 0 spoilers.  It won't go beyond what you have seen in the trailers, promise.  Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hercule Poirot sits at a jazz club and watches a love story develop.  Jacqueline introduces her fiancé, Simon, to her friend, Linnet.  To celebrate, Jacqueline asks Simon to dance with Linnet.  Later, Hercule tries to enjoy dessert in front of a sphinx.  Then he sees a man flying a kite from the middle of the pyramid.  Hercule runs to the man to admonish him but stops when Hercule sees it's Bouc.  Bouc takes Hercule to meet his mother, Euphemia, and they invite Hercule to a wedding party.<br/><br/>At the party, Hercule sees Simon with his new bride, Linnet.  Stunning Linnet wears a 2 million dollar Tiffany necklace and a smile for her guests.  But a hush falls over the crowd when Jacqueline walks into the room.  During each leg of their trip, she appears unwanted to spoil their fun.  At the market, Hercule spots Jacqueline and attempts to plead to her better nature.  Jacqueline tells Hercule that she will never give up, and she has the perfect thing to fix a broken heart: a 22.  Hercule tells Simon and Linnet that they should end their trip, go home, and stay on the property until Jacqueline calms down.  But Simon refuses to let Jacqueline ruin their vacation, and he decides to gain distance by renting a ship, The Karnak, to travel the Nile.  And they invite Hercule to come aboard.<br/><br/>They travel to the rock temples at Abu Simbel, and Simon grabs Linnet for some alone time.  Then a rock comes close to killing the couple, but Hercule doesn't think it is an accident caused by the sand storm.  They board the boat in fear and find a shock.  Jacqueline awaits their return.  After night falls, Linnet takes a pill and resigns to her room.  Simon grows tired of Jacqueline's actions and makes his feelings known.  Jacqueline grabs her gun and shoots Simon in the leg.  Others pull them apart and Linnet's school friend, Rosalie, kicks the gun under the couch.  Linnet's ex-fiancé, Dr. Linus, tends to Simon's leg, and Linnet's godmother's nurse, Mrs. Bowers, calms Jacqueline down with morphine.<br/><br/>In the morning, Linnet's maid, Louise, finds Linnet dead with a gunshot to the head and her necklace missing.  At first, everyone blames Jacqueline, but Mrs. Bowers says she never left Jacqueline's side.  Hercule swears to find the killer before they hit land.<br/><br/>Based on Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie, this movie doesn't pick up exactly where the first one left off, but it does bring the films together.  You must watch from the beginning because the writer explains Hercule's famous mustache and wartorn start.  Within 30 minutes, the plot introduces all the characters and their connection to Linnet.  This chapter in the Hercule series is better than the first and will make you want more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Buster Moon's theater is a raging success with its latest rendition of Alice in Wonderland.  During the performance, Miss Crawly watches Suki in the audience.  Suki is an agent for Crystal Entertainment.  Suki starts to leave before the second act, and Buster chases after her to find out why.  She tells Buster that the show is cute but not ready for the big leagues. Nana tells Buster that nobody can crush his dreams but him.  If he wants something, he needs to fight for it.<br/><br/>Buster comes up with a plan, but he needs one more arrow in his quiver: Ash.  Buster and his friends finagle their way onto the audition stage, but Jimmy won't let them get past their intro.  Jimmy turns to leave.  In an outburst, Gunther says something that makes Jimmy turn around.  Gunther dreamed of a sci-fi play with Clay Calloway as the star.  No one has seen Clay since his wife died. Jimmy agrees to back the show and gives Buster 3 weeks to put it together.  The star, Rosita, needs to make a big dive in her performance.  But she is afraid of heights.  During a progress check, Jimmy's daughter, Porsha, shows Rosita how to do it.  Porsha demands to be the star, and Jimmy makes Buster do it.  But Porsha can't act.  Buster's final hurdle is Clay.  Buster and Ash go to talk to him, but Clay says no.  Ash can see how much Clay is hurting.  So she tells Buster to leave, and she will continue to help Clay take the stage.  After he downgrades Porsha, can Buster pull off the show of his career?<br/><br/>The sequel to Sing has all the laughs and foot-tapping music of the first movie.  But it doesn't have the same inspiring premises as its predecessor.  Also, the funniest moments are in the trailer.  With these few negatives, the movie still entertains with current and original songs.  This sequel makes the film feel final, so it's doubtful they will create a part three.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

While Thomas looks into the hack, Jude tells him their boss, Smith, wants to see him.  Their parent company, Warner Brothers, wants to make a sequel to his trilogy game, The Matrix.  And they will make it with or without Thomas.  Thomas starts to panic because he had a mental breakdown after creating the game.  He couldn't discern reality from dreams.  Now, Thomas sees a therapist to maintain his mental state.<br/><br/>Thomas goes to a coffee shop with co-worker Jude, and Jude forces Thomas to talk to a woman he fixates on every day.  The woman is Tiffany, and she is married with two sons.  Later, they see each other and question him about his game.  She thinks a character, Trinity, looks like her.  Thomas goes back to his office, and an alarm forces an evacuation.  Before Thomas leaves the building, he gets a text message to go to the bathroom.  A man walks out of the stall and introduces himself as Morpheus, and Thomas panics.  Thomas runs to his therapists to handle reality but ends up on top of the roof.  He attempts to jump off and fly when Bugs grabs him.  She tells him the Matrix is real and shows her bunny tattoo.  Her world knows him as the one Neo, and he follows her into the Matrix.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the trilogy has all the effects and wild storylines from its predecessor.  It shows clips of the past for people new to the series.  But, there are phrases, jokes, and other nuances you won't understand without seeing the other films.  While it created an end to the trilogy, it left the door open for something new for the next generation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mr. Wolf is the mastermind behind a gang of thieves.  Mr. Snake is the safe-cracker of the crew with no fingers.  Ms. Tarantula is the hacker, and everyone calls her Web.  Mr. Shark is a master of disguise.  Mr. Piranha is the craziest member because he is willing to fight no matter how many people stand in his way.  Since the world sees them as bad, they act accordingly by robbing banks, pick-pocketing, and running long cons.  Mr. Wolf watches the news coverage, and Governor Foxington's comments make him angry.  Governor Foxington feels sorry for them because they are playing into a stereotype, and she knows the police will catch them soon.  Mr. Wolf wants revenge and decides to loot the Good Samaritan Award, The Golden Dolphin.  The legendary Crimson Paw came close to stealing it but went into hiding afterward.  Mr. Wolf convinces Mr. Snake to take the job by showing him the recipient: Professor Marmalade, a guinea pig.  Mr. Snake can't resist because guinea pigs are his favorite food.<br/><br/>After a wild, well-executed, stinky heist, the team is ready to walk away scot-free.  Then, Mr. Wolf sees an old lady going down the stairs with an open purse full of money and jewels.  He tries to take it, but she starts to fall down the stairs.  He decides to pull her back and help her.  She pats Mr. Wolf on the hand and calls him a good boy.  It has an instant effect on him.  After exposure, Chief Misty arrests the bad guys and throws them in the police van.  Prof. Marmalade speaks on behalf of The Bad Guys.  He offers to reform them at his private residence instead of jail time.  Mr. Wolf agrees on behalf of the entire crew.<br/><br/>Inside the police van, Mr. Wolf's agreement confuses the crew.  They want to know why Mr. Wolf agreed to go 'good.'  Mr. Wolf explains that the award will be at Prof. Marmalade's home.  If they get inside, they will have a second chance to take it.  The Bad Guys will become The Good Guys to be The Bad Guys.<br/><br/>Based on The Bad Guys by Aaron Blabey, this animated Leverage with Logan Lucky comedy style will have adults and kids laughing.  The basis of the heist is realistic, but for children, the animation adds a lot of fun and creative dramatics.  Without it, you can remove the cartoon, add real people, and the script would work.  Adults may want to watch it twice with all the added plot twists.  Yes, there are several within the con.  This movie teaches kids to be more than a stereotype.  That's a lesson everyone can learn.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"It's Halloween.  And while most of Gotham celebrate candy and debauchery, Bruce Wayne uses his mask for vengeance against the city's underbelly.  Batman has looked over the citizens with Lieutenant Gordon and his signal for two years.  Someone killed mayor Don Mitchell, wrapped his head in tape, cut off his thumb, and wrote 'No More Lies' on him.  The killer, The Riddler, left a card for 'The Batman' with a cipher inside.  The Riddler vows to kill more people and unmask the corruption in Gotham.  Batman uncovers pictures of the mayor with a young woman, that is not his wife, coming out of the Iceberg Lounge.<br/><br/>During questioning, a waitress walks into the room.  She freezes when she sees the photos.  The waitress goes to her apartment that she shares with the young woman, Annika, from the images.  The waitress promises to help Annika getaway.  After changing clothes, the waitress gingerly leaves the apartment through a window.  She goes to the mayor's home, an active crime scene, finds a hidden safe and cracks it.  She pulls out Annika's stolen passport when Batman grabs her.  The waitress is Selina Kyle, Catwoman.  Batman worries about the cat burglar and follows Selina back to her apartment.  Annika and their phones are gone.  Selina tells Batman that she will find answers in the 44 Below Club.  It's a private club within the Iceberg Lounge where the crooked politicians and cops hang out.  Batman knows this will be a target-rich environment for the Riddler, so he devises a plan for him and Selina to work together.  In 7 days, Batman will learn that his mask can inspire hope, create resentment, and reveal dark aspirations.  And all roads lead to Arkham.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best Batman movies since The Dark Knight.  It provides action, mystery, a few jump-scares, and intensely emotional moments.  This movie assumes you know Batman's backstory.  While the story and acting were impressive, the running time made the movie drag.  Don't be surprised if you wonder 'is this the end' several times.  The end credits will tempt you to stay, but there are zero spoilers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Fifteen years ago, Nate and his brother, Sam, tried to steal Magellan's map.  It was the first map of the world with a secret to where Magellan and his crew hid billions in gold.  A security guard catches them and turns them over to the nuns at the orphanage.  This is Sam's third strike, and he must leave the orphanage to meet with a judge.  Sam goes upstairs to get his things, and Nate follows.  Nate sees Sam about to escape, and Nate begs him not to leave him.  Sam gives Nate a ring, a lighter, a letter, and a promise to return.<br/><br/>Today, Nate is a bartender with a lot of historical knowledge and sticky fingers.  He lifts a bracelet from a customer when a man, Sully, gives him praise.  Nate refuses to work with Sully, and Sully leaves.  Nate checks his pockets, and Sully's business card is in the bracelet's place.  Nate breaks into Sully's home and finds Sully waiting for him.  Sully notices that Nate stopped at the map on the wall before looking for the bracelet.  Then, Sully tells Nate the map is authentic, like the treasure.  To get it, they need two crosses because they're the key.  Sully already has one, but the other will be in an auction.  Nate doesn't want to be a part of the plan, but Sully mentions Sam.  Sully thinks that finding the treasure will lead to Sam.  Nate will quickly learn that there is no honor among thieves.<br/><br/>Based on Uncharted for Playstation, this movie is how game adaptations should be from this point forward.  It was funny, captivating, and suspenseful.  This film was Indiana Jones and National Treasure with a bit of Goonies.  It's no surprise that the mid-credits scene gives sequel hints.  Some action sequences feel like watching a high-resolution video game.  The film never gets slow or bogged down with unnecessary love stories.  Enjoy this adaption on the big screen for maximum viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Ming believes that Mei's number one priority is family, and she will be the U.N. Secretary-General.  Every day, Mei and Ming honor their eldest ancestor, Sun Yee, the guardian of the Red Panda, and receive prosperity.<br/><br/>After school, Mei's friends, Priya, Miriam, and Abby, ogle the convenience store clerk, Devon.  Mei doesn't think Devon holds a candle to any member of their favorite boy band, 4*Town.  Mei studies after work and doodles.  She notices her doodles look like Devon and obsessively draws romantic scenes with him.  Mei hears Ming at the door and pushes the notebook under her bed.  But Ming finds it and believes Devon accosted Mei.  Ming shows Mei's drawings to Devon and admonishes him for hurting Mei.  Thoroughly embarrassed but quiet, Mei returns home.<br/><br/>After a restless and nightmare-filled night, Mei wakes up, goes to the bathroom, and looks in the mirror.  She finds a giant red panda staring back at her.  Mei calms herself and changes back to her human form, except now Mei has red hair.  She realizes that she must keep calm to stop the change and goes to school with a hat to avoid Ming.<br/><br/>After passing notes, Miriam warns Mei that Ming is outside.  Mei freaks out when she sees Ming with feminine hygiene products, and the panda comes out.  She escapes through the window and runs home.  Ming meets Mei at home and comforts Mei, and Jin says he can't believe it happened so early.  Ming explains that the Red Panda gene passes from mother to daughter.  It started with Sun Yee.  While men fought in a war, the women, children, and the village were unprotected.  So Sun Yee asks the Gods to give her the power to defend the town and its inhabitants.  But there is a cure.  At the next red moon, Ming can perform a ritual to remove the panda from Mei.  The red moon will be on May 25th.<br/><br/>Concerned and with 4*Town news, Mei's friends come by her window to visit.  They tell her 4*Town is coming to Toronto on May 18th.  She unknowingly changes to the panda and pokes her head out the window.  Her friends are happy with her transformation and want to know more.  They all want to go to the concert, but it will cost $200 each and Mei must keep calm.  Mei thinks she can keep it under control with her friends around.  However, that hope is short-lived when a student bullies Mei.  Soon the whole school knows about the panda, but they want to pay for more.  Mei thinks she has everything figured out.  But when Mei has to choose between her friends' happiness or her family duties, her choice will unleash her family's true legacy.<br/><br/>Pixar keeps creating new and complex characters with real-world issues that ground them alongside mystical origins.  Her friends have distinct and loving personalities.  When they discover the truth, they don't shun her.  They embrace her and help Mei find inner peace.  The mix between traditional art, in the storytelling portions, and modern art is effortless.  Don't be so quick to judge.  The film appears to treat Ming as the antagonist, but the plot gets to the heart of her issues and controlling nature.  Now, this movie starts slow because you are anticipating the transformation.  But, the beginning is critical to understand the relationship between Mei, her family, and friends.  So be patient.  And let's not forget the hilarious post-credit scene.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

William hangs up the phone and tells Amy everything will be ok.  Then, he reminds her to turn on the alarm while he goes on a forklift driver interview.  Unbeknownst to Amy, William drives to Danny's chopshop.<br/><br/>As William attempts to ask for a 231,000 dollar loan, Danny collects his crew and cars for his next heist.  He gives William 5 minutes to decide if he is in or out.  If William joins, he will gain millions.  William gears up and jumps on the truck.  But there is a kink in the plan.  Officer Zack built up the nerve to talk to his bank teller crush, Kim.  Seeing Zack won't let up, Danny lets Zack inside.  Soon, Zack realizes something is going on, and all hell breaks loose.  Danny didn't know he was part of a task force sting operation.  They knew Danny wanted to hit a bank and planned to catch him after the robbery without hostages.  But Zack messed up their plan too.<br/><br/>After a fight in the parking garage, William shoots Zack.  They see EMT Cam and Scott loading Zack onto the ambulance.  William pulls Scott from the driver's seat, and Danny tries to force Cam out of the back.  But she will not leave her patient.  Danny agrees because killing a cop is a life sentence.  Also, Danny can use Cam and Zack as bargaining chips with the police.  With millions in their bag and two hostages, can Danny and William get home with the money?<br/><br/>A remake of Ambulancen, this film gives you a brief introduction to William's turmoil.  Then the action gets going.  The synopsis above is the first 20 minutes of the movie.  The tale of family bonds rivals all other films before it.  With a 60-mph surgery, unholy alliances, and sharpshooters, this film allows the audience to care about Cam, Danny, and William.  Watch this movie on the big screen only.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Stuart Long is an amateur boxer looking for his big break, but he is in the hospital again.  The doctor tells Stu to quit boxing.  Wallowing in self-pity, Stu goes to his brother's grave and drinks.  The cops pull him over and arrest him.  When his mother, Kathleen, bails Stu out of jail, he has a new goal: go to Hollywood and become an actor.<br/><br/>Stu arrives in Hollywood with dreams of becoming famous.  He works in a butcher's shop at the back of a convenience store until then.  At work, Stu sees a beautiful woman, Carmen, and tries to ask her out.  She turns him down and walks out of the store.  A co-worker tells Stu that Carmen posted a flyer for a local church.  Stu gets dressed up and goes to church to impress her.<br/><br/>After a tumultuous day with his father, Bill, Stu rides his motorcycle down the street.  A car almost side-swipes him.  While dodging out of the way, Stu runs a red light.  He gets hit by a car, falls into the street, and gets run over by another vehicle.  As he lays there dying, Stu has a vision of Mary.  She tells him he has more in store for his life, and he will inspire others.  After a few surgeries, Stu feels back to his old self.  He calls Carmen on a date. She thinks Stu is going to propose.  Instead, Stu tells her he wants to become a priest.  Stu plans to enter theology school, become a priest, and lead a flock.  As they say, 'If you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans.' Stu will inspire others in a way he could never imagine.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie is about redemption and grace.  Don't expect the wholesome story that viewers get this time of the year.  This film doesn't try to sugarcoat Stu's life or actions.  He, like everyone else, is a flawed man that struggles each day.  The burden of being a living failure weighs heavily on Stu's soul.  But each downfall becomes a triumph and helps him point his flock onto the right path.  See this one, but not with the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
