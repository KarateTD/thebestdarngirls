    "review":"A dozen people wake up in a field with bits in their mouths and locks on the bits’ buckle.  They have no idea where they are or how they got there.  They find a crate in the middle of the field with a crowbar by its side.  Only one man grabs the crowbar and opens it.  The man opens the crate and a pig wearing a shirt comes out.  The man pulls a rack filled with weapons.   As people come to grab a weapon, a young girl finds a key.  The key unlocks the bits.  They gather weapons and start to talk when shots ring through the air.  Only half make it out the field and into the woods.  The six don’t know they are part of a hunt.  Liberal elites have chosen them to travel to the manor and be hunted.  They made one mistake: Underestimating Crystal.<br/><br/>Based on The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell, this movie takes a swipe at everyone.  The Hunt is The Hunger Games and Kill Bill all combined into one political satire and mystery.  This movie shows the ugliness and prejudice in everyone.  Whether we like it or not.  If you have a weak stomach, there will be too much gore for you.  Who is the real snowball?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cecilia has put her plan into place.  As Adrian sleeps, she moves the security camera, turns off the alarm, and tracks him in bed on her phone.  She climbs over the cement barrier, runs through the woods and waits for Emily.  As she gets in Emily’s car, she drops the Diazepam she used to drug Adrian.  Emily drives off with Cecilia, leaving Adrian behind.  Adrian finds the bottle on the ground and heads home.  Two weeks later, Cecilia is hiding out in James’s home with his daughter Sydney.  Walking to the mailbox causes Cecilia enormous anxiety.  She knows Adrian is waiting for her to let down her guard.  Emily tells her to relax because Adrian committed suicide.  Cecilia breathes a sigh of relief.  The next day, Cecilia gets a letter from Adrian’s brother Tom.  Tom is the executor of Adrian’s estate.  Adrian left Cecilia $5 million to be paid monthly in $100,000 installments without income taxes or estate taxes.  One night, Cecilia gets a feeling that someone is around but sees no one.  She brushes it off and goes to sleep.  Cecilia is awakened to notice her covers on the floor at the foot of the bed.  She pulls the covers but they are stuck on something.  She stares to see footprints appear out of nowhere.  She snaps them and hears something fall to the floor and runs. James tells her it’s all in her mind.  Then she remembers Adrian's threat.  If you leave me, I will find you.  You won’t see me but I will leave something behind to let you know I was there.  While no one else believes her, she knows Adrian has faked his death and found a way to make himself invisible.<br/><br/>That thought of someone being in the room, someone watching you, or someone listening to you is a feeling we all know too well.  As the camera pans to an empty spot in the room, you will swear you can see Adrian standing there.  Being invisible allows each attack to be shocking.  This modern twist on The Invisible Man novel is a mix of The Invisible Man movie and Enough.  With strong acting, amazing special effects, and killer designs, the plot feels believable.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"When Claudia receives the news her son Lennon was dead, she was heartbroken.  However, her grief turned to rage when the police declared it a suicide.  She knows her son would never kill himself.  He was happy and making plans for the future.  So Lennon's brother Pierre started investigating.  His results will lead to this case being presented to the F.B.I..  Pierre and Claudia hope Lennon's case will be fully and properly investigated.<br/><br/>This documentary will anger you to your core while bringing a heavy sadness on your chest.  As Lennon's family and friends give you a glimpse of Lennon's life, you are endeared to him.  During the documentary, the lynchings of Moore's Ford and Claude Neal are discussed in great detail.  Hearing first-hand accounts are eye-opening and allow the viewer to see these crimes as a thing of the present.  The film does point the finger at someone but doesn't allow that person to present themselves to the audience.  It's crucial to the validity of the accusations.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
