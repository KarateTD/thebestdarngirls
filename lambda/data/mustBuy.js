        "review":"Stu drives an Uber to help invest in his friend's spin cycle business.  Hopelessly stuck in the friend zone, Stu wishes for more.  Vic is on a path to revenge after Tedjo murders his partner.  After having the case for 6 months, Captain McHenry tells Vic the Feds are ready to take over.  Angry, Vic gets Lasik and has lunch with his daughter.  Since he can't see and she is busy with her gallery opening, she downloads Uber on his phone so he can attend.  While Vic's eyes heal, Vic gets a call from his C.I. Leon.  Leon tells Vic Tedjo has a huge shipment coming today and the call drops.  Vic tries to drive to Leon but crashes his car.  He orders an Uber to take him to Leon's shop and gets Stu.  This ride will change these men's lives forever.  But whether or not it's for the better is up to you.<br/><br/>Be ready to laugh until it hurts.  Don't make the mistake of calling this a buddy-cop movie.  Stu is not a cop and the two men are not friends.  This is a comedy with stunning action sequences and personal character growth.  This movie may not be appropriate for kids under 14.  Also, there are no post-credit scenes.  If you are looking for the best laugh you will get in the theater, Stuber is for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Unlike his time with Andy, Woody is not her favorite toy and not the leader of the toys.  Woody, knowing his job is to protect Bonnie, hitches a ride in her backpack to help her with kindergarten orientation.  With Woody's helping hand, Bonnie makes Forky.  While Forky is her favorite toy, he dreams of going into the trash.  Woody spends every moment trying to save Forky from himself for Bonnie.  But when Woody and Forky are separated from Bonnie on a family trip, Woody has to bring Forky back to her.  He will need Bo Peep, Buzz, Duke Caboom, and Officer Giggle McDimples to come to his rescue.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is everything you thought it would be and more.  With hilarious running gags, stupendous CGI, and astounding voice acting, you are in a trance of wonderment.  Adults and children will love this story alike.  While Jessie, Rex, and Ham are background characters, the story of Woody shines through.  He is so focused on helping Forky with his existential crisis, Woody doesn't see he is having his own.  Not until Bo Peep calls him a lost toy.  While 3D isn't necessary, stay past the end credits for an oddly satisfying moment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

The Elementals have invaded Earth.  The Wind and Earth elements were stopped by Mysterio.  With the assistance of Spider-Man, Mysterio was able to stop the water element in Venice.  Now, Nick wants Peter to go to Prague with Mysterio to stop the most powerful element, Fire.  Peter wants to enjoy his vacation with his friends, so he turns down Nick's offer.  Before Peter and his friends board the bus, the teacher informs them the trip got an upgrade and they are going to Prague.  Peter knows Fury has hijacked their vacation.  With Tony Stark's Glasses and EDITH by his side, Peter will take on Fire.  But can Peter trust what he sees?<br/><br/>While Homecoming introduced us to a younger Spider-Man, Far From Home is his coming of age story without Iron Man by his side.  He has to figure out who he wants to be as a man and a superhero.  While the CGI has gotten better, you can still pinpoint moments where you are witnessing 100% CGI versus green screen scenes.  There are 2 post-credit scenes and a cameo that original Spider-Man fans will love.  See this movie in IMAX.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Every assassin in the world will be after him and no one will offer help.  John uses the hour to find a safe place for his dog, get a ticket, get a marker, and get some gold coins.

John has to complete is stitches and heads to the Director.  He asks the Director to give him passage to Casablanca.  He knows an assassin there who can lead him to the High Table.  He hopes to plead his case so the High Table will let him live.<br/><br/>This movie proves better weapons, excellently choreographed fights, and mind-blowing cinematography is all action lovers need.  With so much going on, this movie provides 30 to 45 minutes of dialogue.  It gives you more of John's training history with the Director but not enough information about the blood oath between him and Sophia.  Seeing John Wick 2 is necessary for this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Simba is next in line for the throne.  But his Uncle Scar believes it's his rightful place.  Scar convinces Simba to go to the gorge to practice his roar.  Soon, Simba is in the middle of a stampede.  Scar runs to his brother, King Mufasa to help Simba but its a trap.  When Simba isn't looking, Scar kills Mufasa and blames the death on Simba.  Scar tells Simba to run away and never come back.  Scar promotes the lawless hyenas as his army while they lay waste to the pride.  It will take one old friend, 2 new friends, and fur to bring Simba back to the pride.<br/><br/>The live-adaption of this Disney classic stays true to the original with astounding attention to detail within mind-blowing graphics.  However, making these animals look like animals, takes away the emotions the animated characters possessed.  This forced the movie to rely on the voice actors to convey every pure emotion.  Some succeeded while other's fell flat.  Also, the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is performed midday.  It feels out of place.  Overall, the movie may not be better than the first but it is still a strong movie worth seeing.  It's better in IMAX and/or 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Good thing she has a Mouse on her side.<br/><br/>While this movie addresses profiling and police brutality, it touches on 2 issues that are easy to miss.  First, the lack of technology.
