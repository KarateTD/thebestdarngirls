        "review":"Brian wants to continue his deferred dream of being in the NFL.  But the new law to fit paroled sex-offenders with an ankle monitor has cut that dream short again.

Only then can he live his dream.  A ping on his computer will change his life forever.<br/><br/>Be ready to get angry and cheer.  The hoops Brian has to go through to clear his name is astonishing.

        "review":"Billi got devastating news.  Her grandmother has stage 4 lung cancer and 3 months to live.  Billi wants to fly to China to see her grandmother but her parents don't want her to come.  The family is following tradition and decides not to tell her grandmother she is sick.  Her parents worry Billi won't be able to keep the secret.  Tradition states that people who get cancer die.  Not because of cancer but because of fear.  The family chooses to bear the burden of that fear so her grandmother won't have to do it.  Her parents fly to China.  A few days later - shocking her family - Billi flies there too.  Billi has to walk the line between Chinese tradition and American culture.  Will she reveal the good lie?<br/><br/>Based on an actual lie, this movie points out the difference between the cultures without condemning one or the other.  Both are explained to the audience with compassion and understanding.  The movie is 90% in Mandarin.  The story is so compelling, it's like reading a great book.  Sidenote: Bring food.  The eating scenes will make you hungry.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

The cool kids decide to let them all come.  Now, Max has one big problem: he has to learn how to kiss.  After several failed attempts to learn to kiss, they use Max's dad's drone to watch Thor's neighbor kiss her boyfriend.  She spots the drone and takes it out.  Max has to get the drone back or he will be grounded and can't attend the party.<br/><br/>As a warning, if you can't handle seeing kids curse, drink, and play with adult toys, this isn't the movie for you.  This coming-of-age story is just as raunchy as Superbad.  And with everything being so over-the-top, the resolution was the most honest and heartfelt of anything in this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Soon, Simba is in the middle of a stampede.  Scar runs to his brother, King Mufasa to help Simba but its a trap.  When Simba isn't looking, Scar kills Mufasa and blames the death on Simba.  Scar tells Simba to run away and never come back.  Scar promotes the lawless hyenas as his army while they lay waste to the pride.  It will take one old friend, 2 new friends, and fur to bring Simba back to the pride.<br/><br/>The live-adaption of this Disney classic stays true to the original with astounding attention to detail within mind-blowing graphics.  However, making these animals look like animals, takes away the emotions the animated characters possessed.  This forced the movie to rely on the voice actors to convey every pure emotion.  Some succeeded while others fell flat.  Also, the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is performed midday.  It feels out of place.  Overall, the movie may not be better than the first but it is still a strong movie worth seeing.  It's better in IMAX and/or 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She sees 2 men dead on the ground an another begging for his life.  She witnesses NARC Malone shoot the man in cold blood.  Another NARC spots her and shoots her multiple times.  She escapes but they want her body cam.  To cover his tracks, Malone tells the chief Alicia went rogue and shot all 3 men.  When the neighborhood kingpin Darius arrives on the scene, he is heartbroken to see his nephew dead on the ground.  Malone tells him Alicia killed his nephew.  Now, Alicia has dirty, armed cops and heavily armed gang members hunting her down.  She must get the camera back to the station to upload the footage.  She hopes to clear her name with the police, call off Darius' hit, and hold Malone accountable for his actions.  Good thing she has a Mouse on her side.<br/><br/>While this movie addresses profiling and police brutality, it touches on 2 issues that are easy to miss.  First, the lack of technology.  If the footage was wirelessly uploaded to the cloud, this movie would not exist.  Second, good cops holding bad cops accountable.  When Alicia decides to tell the truth, she knew she would be labeled a rat.  She doesn't care.  This movie is a wild ride that doesn't get too preachy by adding some quick wit.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

He has stood up to the elite that looks down on him.  Arthur finally feels heard and seen.  But when his mother's letters lead him to a dark truth, he will cross paths with a young Bruce Wayne and brings a new found madness to Gotham.<br/><br/>Now here is the proverbial question: Did the darkness of Gotham create the Joker or did Joker bring out the darkness in Gotham.  This is not for children and it is not the M.C.U..  It's a D.C. comics movie, the way it's supposed to be.  Dark, complicated, gritty, raw, and unfiltered.

This creature will show Maleficent a world she never knew existed.  Maleficent will need to decide: bring peace for the love of one human or bring war for the love of all fairies like her.<br/><br/>See this movie in IMAX.  Any other form will be cheating yourself.  Serving as a sequel, this movie gives a new story for Maleficent while respecting the original.  The CGI, make-up, and costume design are second to none.  Each fairy has a unique look but with little details to let you know they are related.  Be prepared to laugh, clutch your pearls, and gasp with amazement.  This movie is only missing a visual aspect of Ingrith's story.  It's hard to understand if she is lying or telling the truth about her past.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
