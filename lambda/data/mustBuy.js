    "review":"Afghan vet, Alicia West is a 3-week rookie at the New Orleans Police Department.  After hearing gunshots, Alicia walks into an abandoned plant to investigate.  She sees 2 men dead on the ground and another begging for his life.  She witnesses NARC Malone shoot the man in cold blood.  Another NARC spots her and shoots her multiple times.  She escapes but they want her body cam.  To cover his tracks, Malone tells the chief Alicia went rogue and shot all 3 men.  When the neighborhood kingpin, Darius, arrives on the scene, he is heartbroken to see his nephew dead on the ground.  Malone tells him Alicia killed his nephew.  Now, Alicia has dirty, armed cops and heavily armed gang members hunting her down.  She must get the camera back to the station to upload the footage.  She hopes to clear her name with the police, call off Darius's hit, and hold Malone accountable for his actions.  Good thing she has a Mouse on her side.<br/><br/>While this movie spotlights profiling and police brutality, it touches on 2 issues that are easy to miss.  First, the lack of technology.  If the footage was wirelessly uploaded to the cloud, this movie would not exist.  Second, good cops holding bad cops accountable.  When Alicia decides to tell the truth, she knew she would be labeled a rat.  She doesn't care.  This movie is a wild ride that doesn't get too preachy by adding some quick wit.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After asking Aurora to marry him, Prince Phillip extends an invitation for Maleficent to meet his parents, King John and Queen Ingrith.  At the dinner, both women take verbal jabs at each other.  But Maleficent can't take it any longer.  She uses her magic to push everyone away and the king collapses and falls into a deep sleep.  The queen tells her guard, Gerda, to shoot Maleficent with a lead bullet for cursing the king.  Gerda takes the shot and Maleficent falls from the sky.  But she is saved by a dark winged creature.  This creature will show Maleficent a world she never knew existed.  Maleficent will need to decide: bring peace for the love of one human or bring war for the love of all fairies like her.<br/><br/>Serving as a sequel, this movie gives a new story for Maleficent while respecting the original.  The CGI, make-up, and costume design are second to none.  Each fairy has a unique look but with little details to let you know they are related.  Be prepared to laugh, clutch your pearls, and gasp with amazement.  This movie is only missing a visual aspect of Ingrith's story.  It's hard to understand if she is lying or telling the truth about her past.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

When Phil ignores Jexi for his better life, Jexi goes crazy like a stalker ex.<br/><br/>This extremely funny comedy will have you examining how much you live by your phone.  You will question if you Instagram life is better than your real life.  When Denise compares cell phone addicts to crackheads, she believes crackheads are better.  Crackheads have friends, exercise, and get out of the house.  Phil is lacking at all 3.  While this movie has a strong message, it doesn't get preachy.

But when his mother's letters lead him to a dark truth, he will cross paths with a young Bruce Wayne and brings a new found madness to Gotham.<br/><br/>Now here is the proverbial question: Did the darkness of Gotham create the Joker or did Joker bring out the darkness in Gotham.  This is not for children and it is not the M.C.U..  It's a D.C. comics movie, the way it's supposed to be.  Dark, complicated, gritty, raw, and unfiltered.

This movie focuses on Harriet's hardships to become the American Historical figure we know today.  At that time her spells were described as messages from God, now we would consider it brain damage.  This should not be mistaken as the writers giving her a superhuman quality.  This movie should be used as a jumping point for you to research the strength of this one woman.  However, the movie's end felt rushed.  It only mentions her work as a spy in the Civil War and her envolvement in the woman's suffrage movement.

    "review":"In 1987, Walter McMillian, Johnny D to his family, cleared trees and looked up to the evening sky. He had no idea it would be the last day he would look at the sky as a free man. He was arrested for the brutal murder of Ronda Morrison. After the jury sentenced Johnny D to life, the judge overrode their sentence and gave Johnny D the death penalty. In Jackson, Georgia, Bryan Stevenson is an intern meeting with death row inmates to update them about their case. After he graduates Harvard 2 years later, Bryan moves to Alabama, he gets federal funding to start the Equal Justice Initiative or E.J.I., and he hires Eva as his Director of Operations. After meeting 5 other clients, Bryan meets Johnny D. He offers to help Johnny D but Johnny D doesn’t want to hear it. Bryan refuses to quit and meets with Johnny D’s family. They all admit attending a church fish fry with Johnny D the day of the murder. After hearing Bryan met with his family, Johnny D agrees to let Bryan be his lawyer.<br/><br/>Based on Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption by Bryan Stevenson, this story is moving, painful, and honest. It speaks on the unfair scales of justice based on race, class, economics, and political standing. You will be moved to tears when Bryan’s efforts fall short for some. At first glance, you will become angry at Ralph Myers. But as the film progress, you will learn the true nature of why he has done what he has done. You will sympathize with his agonizing decision. When you watch, remind yourself: This didn’t happen during slavery or Jim Crow laws. This happened in the late 1980s, less than 40 years ago. If you are inspired, donate to the E.J.I..<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
