    "mtitle":"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire",
    "review":"After capturing the Hell's Kitchen's Dragon Ghost, the Ghostbusters - Gary, Callie, Trevor, and Phoebe - meet with Mayor Walter Peck. Mayor Peck threatens to charge Gary and Callie with child labor crimes if they don't bench Phoebe. They return home to extract the ghost from the trap, but the containment unit takes a while to go green. Gary and Phoebe start to worry if the containment unit has enough room.<br/><br/>Nadeem enters Dr. Ray Stantz's store with several of his grandmother's items, looking for a quick buck. At first, nothing catches Ray's eye until he picks up a bronze orb covered in ancient glyphs. Ray scans it with a PKE meter, and it violently vibrates. The orb causes the wall around the containment unit to crack. Dr. Winston takes them to his secret lab. He has a containment unit several times larger than the one in the Ghostbuster's basement. Intern Lucky and Lars try to extract the ghost from the orb, but it protects itself with a layer of freezing ice.<br/><br/>They take the orb to a linguistic specialist, Dr. Hurbert Wartzki. He recognizes it from wall carvings in ancient tombs. It houses a ghostly deity, Garraka, who worked alongside a king to expand the king's empire. Garraka rose and started to freeze the world around him. A group known as the Fire Masters trapped Garraka in the bronze orb to protect the world from his wrath. The Ghostbusters must find a fire master to trap and destroy Garraka for good. If not, Garraka will raise a ghost army, bring forth the second ice age, and end humankind.<br/><br/>This sequel starts with a Robert Frost poem and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. It has jokes for older and newer fans of the franchise. While the script packs action in most scenes, the encompassing theme is family. The elder team reunites to help save the world. The current Ghostbusters are finding their groove as a blended family. Also, the Spengler kids are asserting their independence. Parents should be careful. The plot mentions a sex dungeon and hookers once. Also, it has one mid-credit scene. This film is intriguing, suspenseful, heartfelt, and funny.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bobby dons a monkey mask and fights in the Tiger's Temple's underground bouts. After losing to King Cobra, Bobby argues with the owner, Tiger, over money. Bobby must have a longer and bloodier match if he wants more cash.<br/><br/>Bobby orchestrates people to pickpocket Queenie's wallet. Queenie is a restauranteur and criminal mastermind. Bobby walks to Queenie's restaurant and returns the wallet. Queenie offers him rupees for her troubles, but Bobby wants a job instead. He states that he is willing to do the job no one else wants and doesn't fear getting hurt. Queenie gives Bobby the dishwasher position and tells him to stay out of her business. Bobby crossed off step one of his deadly vengeance plan. Blood will spill.<br/><br/>This movie starts with Bobby's mother, Neela, telling him about Hanuman. It's necessary to watch the beginning because Bobby's story parallels this and explains why Bobby wears the monkey mask. This movie offers gritty action, point-of-view camera angles, and the hero's journey. The plot sprinkles Bobby's need for revenge throughout the story. This film has jerky camera angles. People who suffer from motion sickness should think twice before watching. Otherwise, this movie is for action fans with a worthwhile story and eye-popping imagery.

    "review":"In 1936, Joe Rantz attended the University of Washington for engineering. He needs to pay for the 2nd half of this semester in two weeks. After engineering class, Joe's friend, Roger, tells him the rowing team will pay crew members and offer housing. Coach Al Ulbrickson introduces the men to the other coaches, including Coach Thomas Bolles and the boatbuilder George Pocock. The coaches will decide who will join the varsity and junior varsity 8-men teams.<br/><br/>After a grueling tryout, Al picks Joe, Roger, and the other men. The president says they need to win, and he can ask the former students for more money. But winning one race isn't enough. They need to win gold at the Olympics. After the JV team races in the regatta and beat the best time ever by seconds, Al gets an unorthodox idea. Instead of sending the varsity team to compete in Poughkeepsie, he can send JV. The president, donors, and varsity team angrily erupt after Al's announcement. However, he won't budge. Can the JV team prove Al right by making it to the Olympics and winning gold?<br/><br/>Based on The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics by Daniel James Brown, this film focuses on Al, Joe, and their obstacles. Al went with his gut and made an unpopular choice. And he suffered along the way for it. Each time the team hit a new impossible milestone, someone moved the goalpost. Joe raised himself since he was 14. He has to learn how to depend on others and become one. This movie will make you cheer in your seat, but you won't have the urge to delve deeper into this historic win.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After Professor Dr. Thelonious 'Monk' Ellison rages at another student, the school advisors think he should take some time off to focus on his upcoming book and spend time with his family. Monk hasn't sold a novel in years, and several publishers turned down his latest manuscript. Another publisher turned down Monk's work because it wasn't 'black enough.' Monk thinks that's ridiculous. Monk returns to Boston and attends a book festival, but the crowd is thin. Another author explains that everyone is at the session for Sinatra Golden. Monk quietly enters her session and becomes sickened by her book, 'We's Lives in Da Ghetto.' He thinks her book appeals to the lowest demographic and panders to stereotypes. Later, Monk visits his sister, OB GYN Dr. Lisa, at work, and she drives him to their mother's home. They enjoy a night out with Agnes.<br/><br/>Monk and Lisa meet for lunch, and she warns him that Agnes's health is declining. Monk asks if their brother, Plastic Surgeon Dr. Cliff, will help, but he is in dire straits emotionally and financially since his divorce. Then, the unimaginable happens. Now, Monk has to come up with the money to care for Agnes. So, he sits and writes a book called 'My Pafology' with all the racial stereotypes and sends it to Arthur under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh.<br/><br/>Monk gets a phone call from a gleeful Arthur in the morning. A publishing company offered Monk $750,000 for his book. Monk can't believe it and rejects the offer because the book goes against everything he believes. Arthur reminds Monk Agnes needs help. Monk staggers to yes. Monk thinks this deal is one-and-done. However, Leigh's rise could trigger Monk's downfall.<br/><br/>Based on Erasure by Percival Everett, this movie bravely acknowledges issues in literature while defending it. Companies love to shine a light on black voices but only tell the stories of violence and slavery. However, companies shouldn't ignore or overlook these stories either. This plot gives the viewer a glimpse into the writer's process and multiple endings. Also, this movie makes the most uncomfortable moments hilarious. Don't let preconceived notions stop you from seeing this film. It's for everyone. So, do you believe Monk is a sell-out, or does the ends justify the means?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A human-made virus increased apes' intelligence and gave them the ability to speak, but it did the opposite for humans. One of the apes led them to prosperity. His name was Caesar, but he died many generations ago. Today, the Eagle Clan is a close-knit group that will celebrate the bonding ceremony at sunrise. Noa, urged by his mother, runs to his father, Koro, with his eagle egg. Koro is proud but smells a unique scent on Noa's blanket. Noa admits an Echo - their name for a human - took his blanket, but Noa retrieved it. Koro demands to know if Noa went into the valley. Noa truthfully says no.<br/><br/>Noa catches an odor coming from a tent and investigates. He finds a female Echo hiding inside and scares it away. The Echo charges past him and breaks his egg. He needs it for the ceremony. So, he travels into the forest to get a new one. He hears the Coastal Clan riding on their horses and hides. They see Noa's horse in the woods, shock it, and follow it to the Eagle Clan.<br/><br/>Noa hurries home to warn the others, but it's too late. Proximus, leader of the Coastal Clan, had his army attack the Eagle clan and take them prisoner. Noa wakes up in the morning. The Coastal Clan killed Koro and stole the Eagle Clan. Noa travels through the valley and vows to bring them back. Noa will learn the truth about Caesar, the Echos, and Proximus's greatest desire. Proximus is hunting the female Echo because she is the key to the evolution of his Kingdom of Apes.<br/><br/>This latest Planet of the Apes installment has mesmerizing graphics, heart-warming laughs, and a captivating storyline. The plot slows when Noa uncovers Promxius's plan and meets Raka. Don't get confused. This film occurs several generations after Caesar died. One thing Apes and Humans want is knowledge. It's the key to their survival, but can they coexist? This plot point is the movie's standout. Planet fans should keep their eyes and ears open for a few easter eggs. And there aren't any post-credit scenes, but the movie leaves room for another film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Two hold her down while another injects Abigail with a sedative.<br/><br/>They arrive at their destination and put Abigail into a bedroom. The negotiator, Lambert, tells them to keep Abigail alive for 24 hours while he extorts her father for money. One of the kidnappers asks what they should call each other if they can't exchange names. So, Lambert gives them code names. The sedative injector is Joey. The hacker is Sammy, while the muscle is Peter. Dean is the driver, and Rickles is the weapons expert. Frank rounds out the crew with his short temper. Lambert reminds everyone that Joey is the only person allowed to communicate with Abigail and leaves.<br/><br/>Joey visits Abigail. Abigail fears they will hurt her, but Joey pinky-promises they won't. Then, Abigail warns Joey they made a mistake. Abigail says her father doesn't care about her.<br/><br/>The team splits for the night, and Dean goes to the kitchen. Then, something grabs and decapitates him. Sammy finds Dean's body and screams. Frank barges into Abigail's room and demands her father's name. Frank runs to the team and panics because Abigail's father is Kristof Lazar. Rickles knows the lore surrounding the legendary crimelord and decides to leave. Then, something kills Rickles. Frank wants to kill Abigail. He runs to her room with a gun, but Joey stops him after remembering her pinky promise. While they argue, Sammy notices Abigail remove her restraints with ease. Then Abigail transforms into a dancing vampire. She is Kristof's hitwoman, and she will make them pay. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This movie is a bloody, funny mystery with a brilliant ensemble. It's not a traditional horror movie, but it provides entertaining jump scares. The script takes a while to reveal Abigail's powers. It's necessary because it allows the viewers to connect with each character. While the crew makes typical horror mistakes, they get some actions correct. If you like M3GAN, this film is for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Her mother encouraged her to tell stories, perform, and play make-believe. Her dad does the same with his joyful attitude.<br/><br/>After visiting her dad, Bea sees a young girl running in the hallway. Bea chases after her, but the girl runs into the top-floor apartment. Bea knocks, and a man answers without opening the door. The man answers that no girl lives there.<br/><br/>Bea finds an old camcorder and plays the tape inside. It's a recording of happier times with her mother. Then she sees the man and girl outside her window. Bea follows them down the street and watches the man enter a brownstone.

But she is not human. Bea faints.<br/><br/>Bea wakes up in Cal's apartment, and the 'girl,' Blossom, makes Bea tea. Blue explains that they are IF, an acronym for Imaginary Friend. The kids that manifested them grew up. Cal is a matchmaker of sorts. He is helping them find new kids to match with. Bea gets an idea. They will locate the kids who created them as adults now. If they can get the adults to remember them, maybe they'll save the IFs. Bea, who tries to be an adult, will discover the beauty in fun and imagination.<br/><br/>This film is an astounding, heartfelt story that asks, 'What IF.' Viewers must catch this movie from the beginning. The script delivers the lovely relationship between Bea and her parents in a montage. Seeing the IFs helps Bea find joy in having fun again. The script shows the audience the importance of Imaginary Friends then and now. And the score will make your heart swell with excitement.

Captain Conrad assures Marcus that he won't die and gives Marcus a warning. Marcus wakes up with a new lease on life and is 100% fearless. As Marcus begs Mike to get him Skittles, Mike gets a news alert on his phone.

He was looking into corruption after their ecstasy bust years ago. Now, he needs his Bad Boys to clear his name. He warns them to trust no one. Mike believes they must ask a cartel member to catch the corruption.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus visit Armando in prison. Armando states that Conrad was clean. Also, his mother, Isabel, didn't put Conrad on the list; someone added him. Mike and Marcus find Conrad's secret case files and pull Armando out of jail to go through them. They believe they have an advantage, but the culprit is one step ahead. To get through this, Mike and Marcus will need fate, AMMO, Reggie, and alligators.<br/><br/>For newcomers to the franchise, it helps to see the three previous films before watching this 4th installment. This chapter of the buddy-action-comedy will introduce a new version of Bad Boys, tie up loose ends, and show you another side of Reggie. Unlike the previous films, Mike is cautious and has panic attacks. However, Marcus is fearless and wild. Their switch, along with the action-packed fight scenes, make this movie entertaining.

As Riley turns in for the night, her emotions do the same. A beeping awakes Joy in the middle of the night. She and the other emotions walk over to the console and see the puberty light gently flashing. Then, it blares. The demo team rips out the console and updates it for the new guys, but Riley wakes up before they finish.<br/><br/>Riley's mother, Mrs. Andersen, enters Riley's room and expresses her surprise that Riley isn't ready for camp. Her emotions touch the console, and Riley cries, yells, and collapses in bed. They find a new emotion touching it. Anxiety introduces Riley's emotions to Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment.<br/><br/>The Andersens give Riley and her friends a ride to camp. Riley talks about their future together when Disgust notices a look on Bree's face. Grace feels the tension and blurts out that she and Bree will attend a different high school. Riley maintains her composure until her parents drive away. Val notices Riley's sadness, talks to her, and invites Riley to sit with her team. Anxiety takes over and defuses the situation by predicting possible outcomes and changes Riley's personality to give Riley the best conclusion. Joy tries to help, but her attempts make Riley look silly. Anxiety tells Embarrassment to grab Riley's old emotions after Joy makes another mistake. Anxiety tells the mind police to take them to Riley's Dark Secrets Vault. Then, Anxiety disconnects Riley's Sense of Self and sends it to the back of Riley's mind. They will use her new memories with second-generation emotions to build a new Riley. Can Riley's first-generation emotions return to Riley's mind before Anxiety takes over?<br/><br/>Riley and her emotions did it again. They cause the audience to laugh, cringe, cry, and breathe a sigh of relief. The writers added new sections of Riley's mind while taking fans through familiar territory. Riley breaks the rules, disregards her friends, and forces herself to practice when her other emotions are at the helm. Riley loses her Sense of Self for popularity. The movie explains how Anxiety works, helps, and harms people in a lovingly gentle way. The conclusion profoundly affects adults and teaches kids the value of emotions. You should see this movie in theaters today.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Furiosa plucks fruit with her sister, Valkyrie, when she sees scavengers in their woods. Furiosa's home is an oasis, The Green Place, in the wastelands, and she has to protect it. One of the scavengers captures and kidnaps Furiosa. Valkyrie warns their mother, Mary. Mary finds Furiosa but gets captured by Dementus, the biker leader. Dementus sees Furiosa is in good health and demands to know her origin. Both refuse to talk. So Dementus makes Furiosa watch as he kills her mother.<br/><br/>Dementus sees his men are starving and orders Immortan Joe, ruler of the Citadel, to give his people more food and water. When Joe doesn't listen, Dementus captures the ruler of Gastown and brings him to the Citadel. Joe gives in to some of Dementus's requests and makes Dementus the new ruler of Gastown. However, Joe wants Furiosa as a future wife because she has never been sick. Furiosa must escape Joe, get revenge for Mary, and return to The Green Place.<br/><br/>This prequel has the action you expect from the Mad Max series while answering fanatics' questions about Furiosa. This installment tells you who kidnapped her, what happened to her arm, the start of her face paint, and how she developed into a War Rig commander and Imperator. Also, this movie, unlike its predecessor, is told in four parts - The Pole Inaccessibility, Lessons from the Wasteland, The Stowaway, and Homeward. And the director brilliantly connected the two movies for die-hard fans in the last scene. When there isn't an explosion to rely on, the dialogue and storytelling dulls.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
