    "mtitle":"Honest Thief",
    "review":"Tom met Annie a year ago at a storage facility where she worked, and he wants to continue his future with her without looking over his shoulder every day.  The FBI knows Tom as the In-and-Out Bandit. Tom buys a house for him and Annie, then he goes to a motel and calls the FBI.  Agent Sam Baker picks up the phone and doesn't believe Tom's story. So, he gives the phone to his partner, Detective Meyers. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million.  He is willing to give it all back if they give him what he wants.  Tom wants to be held for a maximum of two years in a minimum-security prison with full visitation rights.  Meyers still doesn't believe him, so they hand the case to Agent Ramon Hall and Agent Jason Nivens. After meeting Tom, they believe Tom is another liar, so Tom tells them how he committed the crimes.  Tom gives them the location of $3 million.  They go to the storage unit expecting to find nothing.  However, they find the motherload.  John gets an idea.  They can take the money, kill Tom, and tell Baker and Meyers it was all a hoax. Ramon hangs his head and says yes. Ramon and John walk into the hotel room, and John is prepared to kill Tom, but there is a knock at the door.  It's Agent Baker.  Baker walks inside but can tell something is off, then John shoots him point-blank in the head. Tom jumps in Annie's car and drives away.  Tom has to come clean with the woman he loves, clear his name of murder, and peacefully turn himself in before John and Ramon kill him and Annie.<br/><br/>Yes, this is another Liam Neeson kills-everyone movie, but that's why it's fun.  Tom never claims to be perfect or a good guy.  However, he tells everyone he is honest. It's interesting to contrast what drives each pair to fight together.  Tom and Annie find strength through love and the future.  And for Myers, he fights to get justice for Baker and find the person who killed him.  For Ramon and John, their partnership stands on blackmail and money.  Seeing the pairs work together or for each other changes throughout the film, and it will be their downfall or salvation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

However, it is a bold addition to the franchise.  With glorious landscapes, fantastic wardrobes, and magnificent fight scenes, Mulan will captivate you from beginning to end. With a few changes, viewers get a new story but the same message, never hide your gifts.  This movie classic isn't updated; it's renewed.  And it's enjoyable for the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Guy, much to Grug's chagrin, joined the Croods as they search for Guy's Tomorrow. Grug worries Guy will pull Eep away from the pack, but Ugga tells him that's the natural order. Guy and Eep confirm Grug's fears after he overhears them in the sleep-pile.  Grug gives Eep a rock with their picture and asks her to join him, and start a new pack.  Eep says yes, and Grug leaves the sleep-pile and finds something new.  He wakes up the family and brings them to a high fence.  They knock a hole in the barrier and see rows of fresh food and beautiful flowers.  Before the family gorges, Grug welcomes them to Tomorrow, and now, the pack can stay together, forever.  Then Grug sees something he hasn't seen in a long time, a sweet fruit he called a banana.  Just as he grabs it, it sets off a trap, and a net pulls the entire Crood family up a tree.  Two figures emerge and poke the family with sticks but see similarities. Then, introduce themselves as Phil and Hope Betterman.  After further inspection, they see Guy and hug him.  Before Guy's parents died, the Bettermans were friends with his family, but after the tar killed them, the Bettermans lost track of Guy.  They bring the Croods to their treehouse and introduce the Croods to their daughter, Dawn.  As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Just a warning, some scenes can be pretty gruesome.  But what you are witnessing is three mothers fighting for the boy they love. In the end, it all comes down to Jimmy and how much people are willing to sacrifice to keep him. Viewers get a Kill Bill Vol. 2 moment, and it's worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

This murder case will be his first adult case and a chance to clear Grace's case from his soul.<br/><br/>This movie goes from Encyclopedia Brown to 8mm in less than two hours.  It's a mix of Criminal Minds' unsubs with Psych's hijinks and wit.  You will laugh at the inappropriateness of Abe as he hides in a little girl's bedroom after spying on a teenage boy.  This story is perfection because Abe carries the weight of the town on his shoulders, and you can see the moment the weight lifts.  If you have ever gone through a hard time, you will connect with Abe's tears. When Abe finds the murderer, he will learn the truth about his town and himself.  This movie will become a cult classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Diana works at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as a senior anthropologist. She sees a woman picking up papers scattered all over the floor and bends down to help her.  The woman introduces herself as Barbara Minerva, a geologist and gemologist that likes cryptography.  As Diana walks away, Carol walks in looking for Barbara.  While investigating a jewelry store robbery, police uncovered the store was a front for selling black market antiquities.  The FBI will bring the items to the museum for Barbara to analyze.  As Barbara looks over the items, Diana comes to check things out.  They notice a unique looking stone, but it has a marking Barbara can't understand.  Diana recognizes the language and tells Barbara it says hold it and make a wish.  Diana holds it and makes a wish, and then she invites Barbara to an early dinner.  Later, Diana holds the stone on her desk and wishes to be more like Diana.  The next day, Carol brings their latest platinum donor, Max Lord, on a private tour.  He notices the stone in Barbara's office and wants to know more about it, but Barbara stops him.  He invites Barbara and Diana to a party in his honor for his donation. Diana goes to the party looking for Max.  Max finds Barbara and goes to her office to make out.  In the middle of the session, he asks to borrow the stone for a few days, and she says yes.  As Diane searches for Max, a man calls out to her and says, 'I wish we had more time.'  She turns in blistering anger and tells him not to say that.  It slowly sinks in that her wish came true, and Steve's ghost is in another man's body.  She forgets about Max and focuses on Steve.  This focus is a mistake.  Max runs Black Gold Corporation and advertises it on TV, and while it may look successful, it's a ponzi scheme. But he doesn't wish for his company to succeed, but he makes a wish to become the stone. Diana goes to Max's office and finds dust.  She sees a metal ring that once held the stone and sees an engraving on the inside.  The stone came from the God of Lies. He is granting wishes for his gain.  Diana must find and destroy him before Max destroys the world.<br/><br/>Sequel to Wonder Woman, this movie has all the hair, shoulder pads, and greed of the 1980s.  Many who have seen this movie complain it doesn't have a villain.  But they fail to realize, in the 1980s, greed was at an all-time high. So, greed is the ultimate villain.  The fight scenes are well choreographed and framed perfectly for each shot.  And let's mentions Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  The look on his face is priceless. It does help to see the first movie to catch the little tidbits from the first.  With all the strong points, the film runs too long.  The romance between Steve and Diana takes up too much time. Some of the CGI turns the movie into a cartoon and takes away from the viewing experience.  This movie is watchable for those willing to enjoy a DC movie, not a DC movie compared to Marvel.  And stay after the first end-credits for a blast-from-the-past cameo.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
