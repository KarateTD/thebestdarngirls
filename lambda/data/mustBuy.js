    "review":"Diana works at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as a senior anthropologist. She sees a woman picking up papers scattered all over the floor and bends down to help her.  The woman introduces herself as Barbara Minerva, a geologist and gemologist that likes cryptography.  As Diana walks away, Carol walks in looking for Barbara.  While investigating a jewelry store robbery, police uncovered the store was a front for selling black market antiquities.  The FBI will bring the items to the museum for Barbara to analyze.  As Barbara looks over the items, Diana comes to check things out.  They notice a unique looking stone, but it has a marking Barbara can't understand.  Diana recognizes the language and tells Barbara it says hold it and make a wish.  Diana holds it and makes a wish, and then she invites Barbara to an early dinner.  Later, Diana holds the stone on her desk and wishes to be more like Diana.  The next day, Carol brings their latest platinum donor, Max Lord, on a private tour.  He notices the stone in Barbara's office and wants to know more about it, but Barbara stops him.  He invites Barbara and Diana to a party in his honor for his donation. Diana goes to the party looking for Max.  Max finds Barbara and goes to her office to make out.  In the middle of the session, he asks to borrow the stone for a few days, and she says yes.  As Diane searches for Max, a man calls out to her and says, 'I wish we had more time.'  She turns in blistering anger and tells him not to say that.  It slowly sinks in that her wish came true, and Steve's ghost is in another man's body.  She forgets about Max and focuses on Steve.  This focus is a mistake.  Max runs Black Gold Corporation and advertises it on TV, and while it may look successful, it's a ponzi scheme. But he doesn't wish for his company to succeed, but he makes a wish to become the stone. Diana goes to Max's office and finds dust.  She sees a metal ring that once held the stone and sees an engraving on the inside.  The stone came from the God of Lies. He is granting wishes for his gain.  Diana must find and destroy him before Max destroys the world.<br/><br/>Sequel to Wonder Woman, this movie has all the hair, shoulder pads, and greed of the 1980s.  Many who have seen this movie complain it doesn't have a villain.  But they fail to realize, in the 1980s, greed was at an all-time high. So, greed is the ultimate villain.  The fight scenes are well choreographed and framed perfectly for each shot.  And let's mentions Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  The look on his face is priceless. It does help to see the first movie to catch the little tidbits from the first.  With all the strong points, the film runs too long.  The romance between Steve and Diana takes up too much time. Some of the CGI turns the movie into a cartoon and takes away from the viewing experience.  This movie is watchable for those willing to enjoy a DC movie, not a DC movie compared to Marvel.  And stay after the first end-credits for a blast-from-the-past cameo.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

The movie opens with Matt and Nicole deciding to tell Molly and Evie that Nicole is dying in a few months. From that moment, the story isn't told in a linear fashion, so you must pay attention to the time and dates. It does run long but it gives a strong ending for your time.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Joe works as a middle school music teacher in M.S. 70.  During class, the principal calls Joe to the hallway.  They can offer him a full-time teaching position with time off and benefits, no more part-time work for him.  He goes to his mother's tailor shop, and Libba tells him that he must take the job.  Libba wants Joe to have a steady income with benefits, not an unstable gig, so Joe tells Libba he will take the job.  Joe gets a call from Curley, a former student, and Curley is a drummer for Dorothea Williams, a famous local jazz saxophonist.  Dorothea needs a new pianist. Joe runs downtown as fast as he can and meets with Dorothea.  She tells Joe to sit at the piano and join them.  At first, Joe is confused because he doesn't know the song they are playing, but then he gets into a zone.  When he opens his eyes, the band watches in awe.  Dorothea tells him to get a suit, come back at 9 pm tonight, and congratulations.  Joe made the band.  Excited, he runs home, talking on his phone, and falls into an open sewer. Now, Joe is a soul headed to the Great Beyond.  He runs from the Great Beyond, falls off the bridge, and falls into the Great Before.  All the soul counselors introduce themselves as Jerry.  It's their job to give souls their personality, but one spot remains open.  Once the soul fills that spot by going to the Hall of Everything, they get an Earth pass and start their life.  Jerry assumes Joe is a mentor for souls looking for the spark to fill the last spot.  After several failed attempts to return to earth, Joe sees he is not dead but in a coma at the hospital.  Joe decides to pretend to be a mentor and steal an Earth pass to get back.  Jerry assigns Joe to 22. Twenty-two doesn't see the point of living if dying is the result.  Joe and '22' make a promise, if he helps her find her spark, '22' will give Joe her Earth pass.  He will live, and she will never be born.<br/><br/>As usual, Pixar delivers the concept of life, death, and the beyond in a touching, palatable, and beautiful way.  To parents, there are plenty of jokes for you to enjoy.  But one concept that will pull you in is the land of Lost Souls.  Some of these lost souls aren't dead.   They are so focused on one thing that they stopped living their life. Putting an image to this concept will strike a chord with you.  This movie is a film the entire family can enjoy, and it's a strong entry to close out the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"One night a week, Cassie goes to a club and pretends to be falling-down drunk.  She waits for a guy to pick her up, take her home, and try to rape her.  Before the assault, Cassie tells the guys, 'I'm sober, and I could hurt you.'  At work, a man recognizes her from college.  His name is Ryan, and he's a pediatric surgeon.  They were both pre-med at Forrester University until Cassie dropped out.  Ryan wants to know why, but Cassie won't divulge.  As they talk, he mentions he still talks to their old classmates, including Al Monroe.  That name makes Cassie extremely curious and angry because she thought Al was in London.  Ryan explains Al is back in town to get married, and he became an anesthesiologist after college.  She goes home and looks up Al and several other people, and then creates a Kill Bill worthy revenge list.  And she does it all for Nina.<br/><br/>It doesn't take much to figure out who Nina is and what happened to her.  So, the plot doesn't take the time to explain that.  It follows Cassie's path of rage as she plays pied piper to so-called nice guys.  But her point isn't to murder, but to teach and warn them. But she never has a real plan until she hears Al's name.  She goes from devious to cunning.  She doesn't only go after the man who attacked Nina, but Cassie goes after the ones who let him get away with it.  And once she gets to Al, she has so much more planned for him, and you will love it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Guy, much to Grug's chagrin, joined the Croods as they search for Guy's Tomorrow. Grug worries Guy will pull Eep away from the pack, but Ugga tells him that's the natural order. Guy and Eep confirm Grug's fears after he overhears them in the sleep-pile.  Grug gives Eep a rock with their picture and asks her to join him, and start a new pack.  Eep says yes, and Grug leaves the sleep-pile and finds something new.  He wakes up the family and brings them to a high fence.  They knock a hole in the barrier and see rows of fresh food and beautiful flowers.  Before the family gorges, Grug welcomes them to Tomorrow, and now, the pack can stay together, forever.  Then Grug sees something he hasn't seen in a long time, a sweet fruit he called a banana.  Just as he grabs it, it sets off a trap, and a net pulls the entire Crood family up a tree.  Two figures emerge and poke the family with sticks but see similarities. Then, introduce themselves as Phil and Hope Betterman.  After further inspection, they see Guy and hug him.  Before Guy's parents died, the Bettermans were friends with his family, but after the tar killed them, the Bettermans lost track of Guy.  They bring the Croods to their treehouse and introduce the Croods to their daughter, Dawn.  As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

While holding the record for most running yards in a season, Jim Brown feels respected on the field, but not off it. As they sit in the hotel room trying to convince Malcolm to party, the men will scold each other's motives, interrogate their role in the black community, and question their future.  After this one night, each man's life will change forever.<br/><br/>Based on the One Night in Miami play, this provocative tale, inspired by real-life events, will leave you awestruck with brilliant performances.  The conversations between these men are poignant, striking, provoking, and critical for their advancement. But after one night together, these in-depth and controversial conversations inspire change in each man.  Whether it's a song, a name, a job, or a book, the world will grow from it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1968 Chicago, Bill O'Neal stands outside Leon's bar and notices a cherry red GTO.  He goes inside, flashes an FBI badge, and starts body-searching the patrons.  When he finds the keys inside a man's pocket, Bill arrests the man for grand theft auto.  Another man looks Bill in the eye and recognizes him.  He knows Bill is a con-artist, not FBI.  Bill grabs the keys, jumps in the car, locks the doors, and drives off as the patrons try to stop him.  Later, the police catch Bill in the stolen car.  They arrest Bill and put him in a room for questioning.  FBI Special Agent Roy Mitchell tells Bill he will do 18 months for the robbery and five years for impersonating an FBI agent.  Or he can pick another option. Mitchell offers to drop Bill's charges if he becomes an FBI informant to gather intel on Frederick Hampton.  Fred is the chairman of the Black Panther Party of Chicago.  Under constant threat of arrest, Bill is the lynchpin to one of the darkest days in FBI, Black Panther organization, and American history.<br/><br/>While the title seems extreme, the story of Bill and Fred mirror that of Judas and Jesus.  Bill pretended to be a friend, traded information for money and died like Judas. You will notice that when Bill is the focal point, the camera follows behind him. When he is with others, the camera is always in front or on the side of him.  This change in camera angle helps the viewer change perspective mentally and visually.  The music, setting, makeup, technology, and clothing were in line with the period.  This movie and its dismal conclusion for everyone involved will stick with you.  Not only will you watch again, but you will also start researching the names that history tries to forget.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

One night, Hutch couldn't sleep and checked on his children when he heard a noise downstairs.  It is a man and a woman in ski masks attempting to rob his home.  The woman holds the gun at Hutch's head and demands his money, and Hutch points to a bowl on the counter. Then, Hutch's son, Blake, tackles the man.  The woman turns around and points the gun at Blake.  Hutch grabs a nearby golf club, but he doesn't hit the woman. The man and woman leave but not before punching Blake in the face. Hutch could see that the woman's gun wasn't loaded, so they didn't pose a threat.  At home, Hutch continues, but his daughter, Abby, can't find her kitty kat bracelet.  She left it in the bowl with all the money.  So, Hutch grabs his bus pass and leaves his home. It's not long before he finds Lupita and Luis and tells them he wants the bracelet.  Lupita gives him the watch, but she swears they don't have the bracelet. Hutch leaves and gets on the bus.  After he closes his eyes, the bus comes to a hard stop after the driver witnesses an accident.  The drunk drivers leave their stalled car and board the bus.  This moment was the opportunity Hutch needed all night because it awakens his beast, and Hutch leaves a pile of broken bodies on the bus.  But one of the men, Teddy, is related to Yulian Kuznetsov. Yulian wants revenge for the man that attacked his brother.  But he should be careful because Hutch is a Nobody.<br/><br/>So imagine mixing John Wick's action, Guardians of the Galaxy's music arrangement, and Kill Bill's wit, and you have Nobody.  With bone-crushing and bloody action, this movie proves the mild-mannered man is something to be feared.  As his victims slowly die, Hutch explains who he was, who he became, and why his life changed.  Unlike John Wick, Hutch is a family man with a father in a nursing home. This movie will be a favorite for action enthusiasts.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

And if Greville wanted to give his family a fighting chance to survive a Cold War, he will continue to courier Oleg's information.  Oleg and Greville's partnership leaves a lasting impact on the world we live in today.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe Oleg and Greville's impact on the world then, the world today, and the world to come. These family men form an unbreakable bond and save the world.  They dodge the KGB, death threats, and poisonings to stand up for the world they want for their children. The acting, costumes, hair, and make-up were flawless.  The movie's pace slowed down as the script delved into their private lives, but delving allowed the viewer to see Oleg's and Greville's unique motivation for spying and treason.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

In Pensacola, Florida, Apex Cybernetics has a mole with a Titan Conspiracy podcast named Bernie.  He downloads files and uses them to expose the work at Apex. As he delves deeper into the files, Godzilla attacks the Apex compound. Outside, no one understands why Godzilla is attacking Apex.  In the past, Godzilla only attacks when provoked. Madison listens to Bernie's latest broadcast about the attack and runs to her father, Mark Russell, who lost his wife, Emma, in the previous Monarch attack.  Madison tells Mark about the podcast and Godzilla's history, but he doesn't listen.  Madison decides to find Bernie to track Godzilla's reason for attacking Apex.  But Apex's CEO, Walter Simmons, doesn't want to know why; he wants to stop Godzilla.  He goes to Dr. Nathan and requests his help.  Walter wants Nathan to go to Hollow Earth, the Titan's home. Walter created the Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle or HEAV for short, and it can withstand the reverse-gravitational effect.  And to find the Titan's source of power, they will need a titan, Kong.  With Kong as a divining rod, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan will travel to Hollow Earth to save the world from Godzilla.  But Bernie, Madison, and Madison's friend, Josh, discover that Godzilla isn't the biggest dog in the yard.  Who will come out on top?<br/><br/>Talk about a movie that gets to the point.  You came to see two titans fight, and you won't be waiting for long.  First, they battle at sea, then on land. With so much focus on the titans, the humans were subplots and obstacles for the hero to overcome. The graphics become cartoonish when the titans are on screen alone.  But when they interact with each other or humans, the CGI gets better.  See this movie on the tallest screen possible, whether that's in a theater or at home, and don't stay past the end credits.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
