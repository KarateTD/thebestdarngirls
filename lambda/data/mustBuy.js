    "review": "Arj wants to direct documentaries but can't find a job. Until then, he works part-time at Hardware Heaven and takes gig work for the Task Sergeant app. His next task is to wait in line to buy cinnamon rolls. The server tells everyone in line that they are out of stock. However, she hands Jeff some after everyone leaves. At Hardware Heaven, Arj meets Elena. She wants to start a union for better pay. Arj expresses that it won't help, so Elena walks away. Arj accepts a task to clean a garage. Surprisingly, it's for Jeff. He does a great job and overhears that Jeff lost his assistant. Arj offers his services, and Jeff puts him on a one-week trial.<br/><br/>Gabriel is an angel who saves people from being in a texting and driving accident. He saw Arj texting that his life wasn't worth living before saving him. Gabriel thinks Arj is a lost soul who needs help. Martha calls an Angels meeting. A lost soul's angel, Azrael, tells stories of changing people's lives. It inspires Gabriel.<br/><br/>After a few more run-ins, Arj impresses Elena, and they plan to go on a date. Arj tells Jeff about the upcoming outing, and Jeff advises Arj to take Elena to a nice restaurant. He allows Arj to borrow a jacket and gives him a credit card for company expenses. Unfortunately, the bill is over $300. He uses the corporate card to pay.<br/><br/>Arj arrives for work, and Jeff fires him for using the corporate card for personal business. Arj puts his head in his hands. To Gabriel, Arj looks like a lost soul. He introduces himself to Arj and shows Arj his future to give Arj hope. However, Arj's future is bleak. Gabriel gets an idea. He will switch Arj's life with Jeff's so Arj can see how unfulfilling money can be.<br/><br/>Later, Gabriel meets with Arj to see what he's learned. Arj learned that money is fabulous. Gabriel can't switch them back until Arj desires to change. So he makes himself visible to Jeff and explains the situation. He demands to have his life back, but Arj says no. When Martha discovers what Gabriel did, she fires him. He will become human. Gabriel will only return to his angel form when Arj and Jeff return to their lives. Can Gabriel convince Arj to switch so he can become an angel again?<br/><br/>This film is an honest and delightful view of the average person's struggles. The script gives you the horror stories of gig work, along with the community it builds. The comedic timing in this movie is stellar and goes for the educated laugh. The conclusion is beautiful. This movie starts like It's a Wonderful Life, but becomes much more. The theme is for the modern-day audience and touches the soul. The edits aren't smooth, but it doesn't distract from the message.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Long Walk",
    "review": "Raymond Garraty, along with 49 other young men, received a letter from The Major. Out of the applicants from his state, the Major chose him to participate in the long walk. The winner will receive a monetary prize and one wish. Garraty's mother, Ginnie, cries as she delivers her son to the starting point. She begs him to quit, but the deadline was yesterday. He grabs his gear and baseball before hugging Ginnie goodbye.<br/><br/>Garraty enters the gates and sits with the other young men. He meets Peter McVries, a man who wishes to do good with the prize. Stebbins is the strongest of the bunch. Arthur Baker's faith inspires him, and Hank Wang focuses on the untold riches. Gary Barkovitch is a loner, and Collie Parker wants to document the experience. Then, the Major walks onto the tank and explains the rules. They must walk 3 miles per hour with no finish line in sight. If they slow down, they get one warning and have 30 seconds to regroup. The third warning means death. They will face instant death if they run away or step off the pavement. It's walk or die. While others want riches, Garraty has another reason to enter this competition: revenge. Who will win?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Long Walk by Stephen King, this dystopian thriller shares similarities with the original, but it's not a retelling. However, the film retains the book's impact. The director made a bold choice by using natural lighting and empty surroundings to draw the audience's focus to the contestants. Also, the surroundings mirror their despair. The graphics department didn't shy away from the blood and gore. Unlike the Hunger Games, the Major is not a man of reason. He is unflappable, rigid, and single-minded. Also, the juxtaposition of the final stretch breaks your heart. The winner breaks down in gut-wrenching sobs as the crowd celebrates with fireworks and the national anthem. It's a moment that will stick with you after the film. The studio labeled the film a horror, but it's a warning. You should see this film if you can stomach the unflinching violence.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Talent manager Anna bangs on her daughter's door before school. However, Harper won't open the door. Anna's mother, Tess, calls to offer Harper a ride to school. Anna wants to give Harper a ride and tells Tess to relax. Therapist Tess hangs up, finishes her podcast, and kisses her husband, Ryan, goodbye. Finally, Anna opens the door and finds Harper's note. Harper started her morning with surfing.<br/><br/>In the car, Harper groans about her chemistry partner, Lily. Harper thinks Lily is obnoxious. Tess and Anna advise Harper to keep an open mind before dropping Harper off at school. That treaty is non-existent. Lily and Harper argue during chemistry class, causing a foam explosion. The principal calls Anna and Lily's dad, Chef Eric, into school. They run into each other in the halls and fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged.<br/><br/>Lily and Harper disagree during a school bake sale, triggering a school-wide food fight. The tension in the home is rising between Harper and Lily. Anna tells them that they will attend her bachelorette party and get along.<br/><br/>At the bachelorette party, a multi-hyphenate psychic, Madame Jen, offers to give Anna and Tess a reading. Lily and Harper argue in the corner, and Madame Jen interrupts them. Madame Jen tells them, 'Change the hearts you know are wrong, so that you may find where you belong.' Harper thinks she belongs in LA and Lily London. The four feel an earthquake. Tess and Anna try to ignore it.<br/><br/>Harper, Tess, Lily, and Anna return to Tess's home. They make Lily and Harper sleep in the living room to force them to be friendly. They sleep through the night. When Harper wakes up, her face and hands feel dry. Tess hears her daughter's yell and wakes on the couch. She notices her bones feel better. She's in Lily's body. Tess and Lily switched, like Anna and Harper. They ask Harper and Lily if Madame June said anything to break the curse. They lie and say no. Lily and Harper will use the swap to break up their parents' wedding. A wedding that happens in a few days. Can they swap back before the wedding, if there is a wedding?<br/><br/>Sound the alarm! This sequel respects the original while being a multigenerational, heartfelt, funny film. Like the first movie, the script features a wedding on the line, with a new husband, but changes by adding a relocation and Lily's deceased mother. For the die-hard fans, everyone returns. The Pink Slips, Harry, and Mama P make a satisfying comeback for the fans. The writers hide easter eggs with the soundtrack, decor, jokes, and food. Freakier Friday is a comedy with great timing and physicality. It celebrates complicated family dynamics without muting anyone's perspectives or feelings. You will leave this movie as you did the first, feeling seen and seeing. This film is a sequel that's worth seeing in theaters and is worth the wait.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Bartender Hank closes the bar and meets his lady friend, Yvonne. Hank runs into his neighbor, Russ. Russ learned that his father had a stroke, and now he has to fly to London to be at his bedside. He asks Hank to care for his cat, Buddy. Later, Yvonne gathers the litter box and brings it into Hank's bathroom.<br/><br/>After closing the bar, Hank comes home to see two men, Aleksei and Pavel, knocking on Russ's door. They ask Hank for Russ's location, but he refuses to give it to them. They ruptured his kidney, so a doctor had to remove it. Curious, Hank enters Russ's apartment to search it. He escapes when the mobsters return. Hank calls the police.<br/><br/>Detective Elise Roman interviews Hank about the intruders. She informs Hank that Russ is a drug dealer, working for some hardcore criminals. Elise says the Russians are dangerous, but Hasidic gangsters, Lipa and Shmully, are monsters. She gives him a number in case Hank sees the mobster and gangsters again. Hank enters his bathroom and notices something strange in the litter box. One poop is fake and hides a key. Hank runs to his job with the key in hand. His boss, Paul, convinces Hank to drink. Hank gets drunk and returns home. He pukes on the exterior door, takes off his clothes, and enters his apartment.<br/><br/>Inside, Aleksei and Pavel are waiting for him with mobster Colorado. They want the key and torture Hank for it. Hank tells them it's in the litter box, but it's missing. Hank remembers he took it to the bar. They demand that he obtain the key and not call the cops. If Hank doesn't find the key, they vow to kill him and everyone he loves.<br/><br/>Based on Caught Stealing by Charlie Huston, this film is action-packed and surprisingly witty. The storytelling is interconnected and intelligent. Every object, character, and monologue has a deeper meaning and merges into the conclusion. The director didn't choose fancy angles to narrate the story. Instead, they used New York and baseball as the backdrop. The natural light and languages make the tale feel authentic. This film is for you if you enjoy crime comedies with an enigma.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Elwood lives with his grandmother, Hattie, after losing his mother. He is attentive in school and dreams of going to college. His teacher, Mr. Hill, doesn't teach American History from the textbooks. He encourages his students to be free-thinkers, question authority, and demand change in the Jim Crow South. Mr. Hill sees promise in Elwood and gives Elwood a pamphlet for a free college. Elwood decides to hitchhike to the school and apply. A man pulls over and offers Elwood a ride. Later, police pull the man over. They arrest the man and Elwood for stealing the car. The judge sends Elwood to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school for boys.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Elwood to uncover that the staff treats black and white students differently. He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it. This film is an extraordinary watch if you can handle it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She dreams of being a wrestler, but every state bans women in the squared circle. Mildred and her mother, Bertha, attend a wrestling match and watch Billy Wolfe win.<br/><br/>Billy and his son, G. Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie. He offers to train her the next day.<br/><br/>Mildred arrives at the carnival, and Billy and G. Bill sit outside the ring. To prove her worth, Billy has Mildred face a man. She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Rocketman joins other members of the French 75 outside of an immigration center. Perfidia sees him and asks what's in his wagon. He explains that it's explosive, and she's intrigued. As Rocketman sets the explosives, other members gather the immigrants and detain the soldiers. Perfidia distracts Captain Lockjaw. Her take-charge attitude arouses him as she steals his hat and gun. She, the team, and the immigrants exit the center, using Rocketman's explosions as a distraction.<br/><br/>The French 45 set up political attacks everywhere, but don't know that Lockjaw has fixated on Perfidia. He follows them on their next mission and corners her in a bathroom. He offers to let her go if she meets him at a hotel with his gun and hat. If not, he will expose her crew. She slithers away and completes the mission. Then, she joins Lockjaw in a hotel room and leaves sans hat and gun.<br/><br/>Eight months later, Perfidia is pregnant, and Rocketman worries that she is ignoring it. After their daughter's birth, Perfidia becomes jealous of the time Rocketman spends with their little girl, Charlene. During a grocery run, Lockjaw stands behind Rocketman and asks about the baby. He states it's a girl and biracial.<br/><br/>Perfidia gathers a team to rob a bank to fund the French 75. During the robbery, Perfidia shoots and kills a security officer. The police catch and detain her. Lockjaw gives her an option: give up the crew or die in jail. Perfidia turns state's evidence and enters the witness protection program. The French 75 hears about Perfidia's capture and runs to protect Rocketman and Charlene. They give him a trust device, new identities as Bob and Willa, and a nearby sanctuary city. Lockjaw returns to Perfidia after the roundup, but she's fled to Mexico.<br/><br/>Sixteen years later, a man approaches Colonel Lockjaw with an invitation to an exclusive club, the Christmas Adventurers. They are a group that believes in strong borders, family values, and purity. Then, they inquire about interracial relationships. Lockjaw says he has only slept with women of his race. They inform him that they will conduct a double Yankee background check into his past. Lockjaw leaves with his head full of pride, but he has one problem: Charlene. She could be evidence of his night with Perfidia. He sends the army to locate her and bring her to him.<br/><br/>Willa attends high school and isn't allowed to have a phone. Bob hasn't disclosed much about his past, but tells Willa her mom was a hero who fought for everyone's freedom. Willa attends a school dance and goes to the bathroom. Her trust device starts to make noise, and Deandra gives Willa the passphrase. Under Deandra's instructions, Willa leaves the party with her. Bob receives a phone call that the army captured a former member looking for Willa. Bob, in a stupor, enters a tunnel, grabs his gear, and runs to locate Willa. He must keep her safe from Lockjaw before Lockjaw exposes the truth about him, her mother, and Bob. Can Bob save Willa?<br/><br/>Inspired by Viceland by Thomas Pynchon, this film begins as a revolutionary heist film and changes to a game of chess. The director didn't concentrate on title cards or clothing to give the film's period. It's left up to the viewer to decide. The writers centered on the mission while illuminating issues such as immigration, the undocumented workforce, history, and lineage. The natural lighting and close-up allowed the cinematography to maintain its gritty edge. The script is sharp-witted, charming, and edgy. This film makes you laugh and flinch. However, the writers don't want to change ideals or force policy. They focus on telling a compelling story that captivates from start to finish.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Bogo presents their latest case to the squad. It's a crooked dock inspector. He gives the team their assignments and puts Nick and Judy on observation. However, they aren't there. Officer Clawhauser informs Bogo that Nick and Judy are on the scene and took the lead.<br/><br/>The bust becomes a TV spectacle, putting Judy and Nick in the hot seat. Judy tries to explain that she found snakeskin in one of the crates, but Bogo won't listen. Besides, reptiles haven't been in Zootopia in 100 years. That's when they created the weather wall. Judy discovers that the culprit will be attending the Zootenial Gala. Zootopia's founder, Ebenezer Lynxley, will be honored at the event. His family will display his journal, which contains the idea and blueprints for Zootopia.<br/><br/>Judy convinces Nick to attend the gala undercover. Judy bumps into Pawbert Lynxley, Ebenezer's grandson, and he's smitten with her. His father, Milton, runs the family business and upholds the legacy with his other two children, Kitty and Cattrick. Nick shines a light on the culprit before they grab the journal and try to run away. Judy and Nick follow them into a private room and remove their cloak. It's Gary De'Snake. He tells Judy they aren't the bad guys and the journal can prove it. Before Gary reads the journal, Milton, Kitty, and Cattrick kick open the doors. Bogo barges into the room, and Gary accidently bites him with one of his fangs. Judy breaks it and holds it in her hand. When the other officers enter, Milton says Judy, Nick, and Gary attempted to kill Bogo. They escape before the police arrest them, but they are enemy number one. Can Judy and Nick clear their name while helping Gary uncover the truth?<br/><br/>This sequel is clever, endearing, and funny. It covers perception, smear campaigns, history washing, and forced migration with ease and compassion. During these hard-hitting topics, the script tackles the partnership between Judy and Nick. The animation rivals the first film. Disney manages to give the animals human-like qualities while displaying their unique animalistic characteristics. This installment expands the animal world while rooted in its core cast. The beginning recaps what happened in the first film, so you don't have to see it to enjoy this. The end-credit scene gives the viewer a hint at what is to come. See Zootopia 2 with the whole family today.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

However, Richard won't change his mind because Ben spoke to union leaders about his working conditions. Ben will remain on the list.<br/><br/>Ben watches game shows with Cathy until his wife, Sheila, returns home. She wants to spend time with Cathy, but changes her mind after feeling Cathy's fever. He hates that she has to flirt with wealthy men for tips, especially after one client killed her co-worker. He gets an idea. He will go to the network building and be a contestant on one of their shows. Sheila rejects the idea because she fears he will try out for The Running Man. Ben assures her he would never try out for that game before leaving.<br/><br/>Ben walks through the gates of the network building. They pull up his work history and tell him to go to elevator 26. Hopeful contestants, Jenni and Tim, greet Ben. The Network showrunners perform physical and psychological tests on the contestants. To Ben's surprise, they picked him to be on the Running Man. Ben tries to force them to change, but they refuse.<br/><br/>Ben meets with the Network owner, producer Dan. Dan shows Ben the lucrative contract. He gets a bonus for every day he remains alive and a $500 signing bonus. Ben signs the contract and assures Dan he will be the first contestant to go the distance.<br/><br/>Dan introduces Ben, Tim, and Jenni to the show's hosts, Bobby T.. Bobby gives a quick hello before running on the stage. Ben rages at the false narrative Bobby spins to make the fans hate him. Then, Bobby gives the rules. The runners will have a 12-hour head start. The further they go, the more money they will make. They have to film themselves every day for 10 minutes and drop it in a mailbox. If they don't, they won't get the money, but the hunters will still come after them. They have to last 30 days. Ultimately, they will receive $1 billion. Will he survive the Running Man and make it home to his family?<br/><br/>Based on The Running Man by Steven King, this film has a spectacular pace, wild stunts, and a fresh twist on a familiar plot. This film isn't just about a man running for his life. It's a searing indictment of media manipulation by corporations. The director uses different camera techniques to capture Ben's runs. It could be a steady drone camera shot, a GoPro-style shot, a handheld camera shot, or standard movie framing. These changes display an enticing view of Ben and his run. The soundtrack stays in step with Ben's speed and gets you excited. The action slows with a purpose. It speaks to corruption, pollution, and screen addiction. The plot delivers these messages without getting too topic-heavy or self-righteous. This film is an exciting and violent ride.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Sarah walked into the office and signed her name proudly. Her parents, Rose and Joseph, want to sell her land because they can't pay the $30 property tax. However, Sarah has other plans. She convinces her father to ask local oil companies to drill on her land. He relents.<br/><br/>Joseph approaches several oil companies, but most won't let him walk into the front door. He asks Sarah to wait outside while he speaks to Devnan at Pan Oklahoma Petroleum. Sarah walks into Busy Bee Café and asks for water. However, the waitress points to the whites only sign.

    "mtitle": "The Housemaid",
    "review": "Millie arrives at the Winchester Estate, and Nina Winchester greets Millie with a smile and hor d'oeuvres. Nina examines Millie's résumé and qualifications. She reiterates that the position is a live-in maid. Nina confesses that she's expecting but hasn't told her husband, Andrew, or daughter, CeCe. Millie thinks everything is wonderful. Nina expresses that she has more applicants to interview before choosing a housemaid. But she will call Millie back soon.<br/><br/>Millie drives away, removes her glasses, and rolls her eyes. She never expects to hear from Nina again. Millie is on probation for 5 years after serving 10 years in prison. She knows one background check will rule her out. Millie takes showers in gas station bathrooms, applies for any job, and sleeps in her car. When her phone rings, it's Nina offering Millie the job. She wants Millie to start as soon as possible, and Millie is willing to do so this afternoon. Millie thinks her prayer has been answered. She has a steady job, a paycheck, and a place to live. Her probation officer will be pleased. However, Millie has no idea the danger lurking behind the iron gate.<br/><br/>Based on The Housemaid by Freida McFadden, this film is a wild ride that plays with motifs, surroundings, and wardrobe to convey deeper meanings. The house is void of color except for one bathroom with snake wallpaper. Nina always wears a hue of white until the telling ending. She's seen as clean, perfect, and pure. Millie and Andrew stain on the screen as they wear darker wardrobes. The different angles show the power dynamic shift throughout the film. It will leave you dizzy. Also, the split screens and overlays of different people experiencing the same turmoil are jaw-dropping. This film will make you want to read the book and compare it. It's pragmatic, cultural, and surprising.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Ella McCay",
    "review": "Lieutenant Governor Ella McCay approaches her office when her secretary, Estelle, hands Ella a letter. A reporter wants exclusive access to her. If not, he will release damaging information he has about her and her husband, Ryan. Ella pushes the matter aside and jumps in her vehicle. Her driver, Trooper Nash, drives Ella to her aunt's bar. Aunt Helen raised Ella since she was 16 and has been the voice of reason for Ella. Helen's advice is to dump the dead weight: Ryan. Ella refuses because he's provided a sense of fun for her.<br/><br/>Ella returns to work, and Governor Bill is waiting in her office. The President chose Bill as the next Secretary of the Interior, and Bill will name Ella the acting governor immediately. While Ella is good at passing legislation, she isn't well-liked amongst constituents. Ella believes she can win them over with her tooth tutor and well baby legislation. Bill shakes his head, stands up, and grabs the doorknob. He lets Ella go first and announces her promotion. Ella shies away from the camera as Ryan smiles for the it, grabs her, and dances with her. She wants to do good for her state, but life will happen.<br/><br/>Ella McCay is a smartly-written film about family, relationships, and politics. The plot teaches micro lessons in civics while entertaining. Ella is highly capable and intelligent. However, she has anchors pulling her down. Sadly, she doesn't see how her two biggest pitfalls mirror each other until it's too late. The cast did a stellar job of acting with little dialogue. They let their facial expressions and hand gestures convey the message. At the conclusion, this picture will encourage you to scream healthily.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Avatar: Fire and Ash",
    "review": "After Neteyam's death, Neytiri and Jake debate what to do with Spider. Neytiri, unable to bear Spider's resemblance to those who killed her son, wants him gone, while Jake hesitates. That night, Spider's mask fails, and he begins gasping, prompting a frantic search for his spare mask. They save him for the moment, but Jake realizes the replacement mask will also eventually fail. When the Wind Traders arrive in Metkayina, Jake decides to bring Spider back to the humans for his safety.<br/><br/>Jake, Spider, and the family travel with the Wind Traders toward the RDA ship. En route, the Mangkwan, or Ash People, attack their aircraft. Amidst the chaos, Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak are separated from the group. Spider's mask battery runs low, and his spare batteries are with the wreckage. Spider collapses. Kiri lays him down, links her queue to the ground, and puts a bug in his mouth. Spider miraculously recovers. Colonel Miles witnesses this and becomes determined to capture his son and bring him to RDA for study. Jake knows that if Miles gains access to this miracle, humans will become unstoppable. The coming battle will result in heavy loss, two new unions, and new life for Pandora.<br/><br/>The third installment of the Avatar franchise focuses on the action while building the Pandora lore. The graphics draw you into Na'vi's world with motion and colors that were meant for 3D, and the score teleports the audience into each breathtaking adventure. While nothing will ever top this first, this film towers above the second in every category. This film has no mid-credit or end-credit scenes. If you are a fan of the first two, then you must see this one in theaters and in 3D with the best sound.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Marty Supreme",
    "review": "Marty Mauser works at his uncle Maury's shoe store. As Marty sneaks in his girlfriend, Rachel, Maury asks to meet with Marty. He hands Marty a business card with Marty's name and the title 'Manager' on it. Marty reminds Maury that he doesn't want to sell shoes. Also, Maury's son, Lloyd, will dislike being passed over. Marty dreams of going to the British Open for Table Tennis.<br/><br/>Later, Marty practices with his friend, Wally, and returns to the store for his check. Lloyd locks the safe, and Marty grabs a gun from Maury's desk. Marty threatens to shoot Lloyd over the money. Then, Marty shows Lloyd the business card. Lloyd opens the safe and gives Marty $700.<br/><br/>Marty arrives in London and hates his accommodations. After making it to the finals, Marty sits down with reporters. They stop talking when actress Kay Stone enters. Marty sets his sights on her and invites her to his room. Before the finals, Marty takes a moment to cozy up to Kay's husband, Milton. However, Marty's plans shatter when he loses to Japanese hopeful Koto Endo. Marty will do anything to prove his purpose: to dominate table tennis. Will he prove the world wrong and become the face of the sport?<br/><br/>It's not easy, but the writers make every character in this film unlikable. It should be about one man's triumph over his doubters. However, Marty is condescending, arrogant, rude, and manipulative. The audience prays for his downfall to humble him. Inspired by Marty Reisman, the technology and style follow the 1950s, but the slang falls short. This picture is Oscar-worthy because the acting is phenomenal. However, the audience won't cheer for anyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
