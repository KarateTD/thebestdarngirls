She escapes but they want her body cam.  To cover his tracks, Malone tells the chief Alicia went rogue and shot all 3 men.  When the neighborhood kingpin Darius arrives on the scene, he is heartbroken to see his nephew dead on the ground.  Malone tells him Alicia killed his nephew.  Now, Alicia has dirty, armed cops and heavily armed gang members hunting her down.  She must get the camera back to the station to upload the footage.  She hopes to clear her name with the police, call off Darius' hit, and hold Malone accountable for his actions.  Good thing she has a Mouse on her side.<br/><br/>While this movie addresses profiling and police brutality, it touches on 2 issues that are easy to miss.  First, the lack of technology.  If the footage was wirelessly uploaded to the cloud, this movie would not exist.  Second, good cops holding bad cops accountable.  When Alicia decides to tell the truth, she knew she would be labeled a rat.  She doesn't care.

Maleficent will need to decide: bring peace for the love of one human or bring war for the love of all fairies like her.<br/><br/>See this movie in IMAX.  Any other form will be cheating yourself.  Serving as a sequel, this movie gives a new story for Maleficent while respecting the original.  The CGI, make-up, and costume design are second to none.  Each fairy has a unique look but with little details to let you know they are related.  Be prepared to laugh, clutch your pearls, and gasp with amazement.

    "review":"Spencer feels like his life is in a rut so he goes back into Jumanji to feel brave.  Realizing what he has done, Beth, Anthony, and Marsha go back in to save him.  However, Bethany is left behind and Spencer's grandfather, Eddie, and Eddie's former friend, Milo are pulled into Jumanji.  With new avatars, missions, and goals, this is the next level of Jumanji.<br/><br/>Jumanji does just what the title says it will do, it goes to the next level.  Every character you know is back and more were added for fun.  It has all of the laughs and craziness you want from this franchise.  As the trailers say, not everyone will leave the game.  Jack Black is the breakout again playing 3 different characters.  Kevin Hart shows his acting chops as he plays Milo Walker.  See this movie as soon as you can.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
