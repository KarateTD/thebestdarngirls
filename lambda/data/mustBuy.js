    "mtitle": "The Fantastic Four: First Steps",
    "review": "On Earth-828, the world praises their heroes, dubbing them The Fantastic Four. Four years ago, astronauts Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm went to outer space. A cosmic ray blasted them during their mission, and they gained superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>Today, Sue exits the bathroom and gives her husband, Reed, her positive pregnancy test. They joyously hug and meet Sue's brother, Johnny, and Reed's best friend, Ben, for a dinner prepared by HERBIE. Ben can see the petrified look on Reed's face and deduces that the happy couple will be parents. They celebrate while Reed worries. With their altered DNA, he has no idea what the future will bring for their unborn child.<br/><br/>Over the next few months, Sue negotiates peace talks among all countries and the land of Subterranea. She's preparing for maternity leave when the team receives an alert on their wrist watches. Something has entered the atmosphere. A being on a silver surfboard asks if they are the protectors of the planet. They answer yes. She warns the world that Galactus, Destroyer of Worlds, will arrive on Earth and eat the planet. The Silver Surfer flies away.<br/><br/>The world cheers for the Fantastic Four on Excelsior Launch Day. They locate Galactus just in time to watch him devour a planet. A beam scans their ship but lingers on Sue's stomach. The Silver Surfer enters their spacecraft and invites them to meet Galactus. Galactus says he will spare Earth if they give him their baby. He says the baby hides its true nature from them. Galactus believes the baby will take over his mantle and end his hunger. They refuse, and Galactus uses his powers to make Sue go into labor.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four escapes Galactus's ship, and the Silver Surfer is hot on their trail. They flee to Earth, but not before Sue gives birth to their son, Franklin. They return to a press conference waiting for good news. Sadly, they report that Galactus is coming because they wouldn't give up Franklin. They must find a way to defeat Galactus or lose everything they love. Can the Fantastic Four rescue their family while saving their world?<br/><br/>This film will remind fans why they love superhero movies. The costume and set departments had the ultimate tasks. They had to give the picture a '70s feel while making it futuristic. Their designs expand the imagination and are award-worthy. The script is funny and engaging. Also, Galactus is an old-school villain. He just wants to destroy things. Franklin's CGI isn't perfect, but the team's graphics make up for it. This new adaptation of the iconic superheroes is what fans deserve. The film has a mid- and post-scene. While the mid-credit scene is essential to the future of the MCU, the post-credit scene is for nostalgia.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning",
    "review": "IMF agent Ethan Hunt sits in a private bunker when he gets a VHS tape directly from President Erika Sloane. Since Ethan did not return the cruciform key in his last mission, the Entity has roamed free on the internet. Without intervention, it will have the world's deadliest forces under its control. The world has two choices. They can become a slave to the Entity or shut down the internet. However, the latter would ensure worldwide chaos. President Sloane gently demands that Ethan turn himself and the key over to her.<br/><br/>With Paris's tip, Ethan and Grace travel to London to find Gabriel. Gabriel gets the drop on them, and they wake up bound. Gabriel admits that the Rabbit's Foot wasn't a biological weapon. It was a device that could give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape and meet with Luther and Benji. Luther hands Ethan a device with malware. If Ethan attaches the device to the Entity's source code, it will infect the Entity, and they can trap it.<br/><br/>Paris takes Ethan to a capsule that Gabriel used to communicate with the Entity. Ethan lets the Entity into his mind, and it discovers a plan of attack. However, Ethan sees the plan too. The Entity plans to escape to the Doomsday Vault in South Africa.<br/><br/>Ethan finally falls in line and turns himself over to the President. However, he urges President Sloane not to arrest him because the Entity knows Ethan is the only one with the power to stop it. She writes a note, seals it, grabs the key, and slips it to the guard. She demands that the guards take Ethan to his cell. The guards take him to an awaiting helicopter and give him the key and the note. Now, Ethan must find the location of the source code, retrieve it, and capture the Entity in South Africa. If not, the Entity will fire the world's nuclear weapons. Can Ethan move in the shadows one more time and save the world?<br/><br/>This eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers a heart-pounding thrill ride with unthinkable missions, setbacks, heartbreak, and breathtaking action. The stunts and graphics are smooth and don't distract from the plot. The film doesn't rely heavily on humor because it focuses on the emotional aspect. It does use a similar setup for two scenes. However, they don't feel redundant. Unlike other films, this picture has three nerve-racking moments running simultaneously. Don't be surprised if you hold your breath. It is one of the best Mission: Impossible films of the series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Bad Guys 2",
    "review": "The Bad Guys enjoy life on parole but can't find employment. Mr. Piranha, Ms. Web, and Mr. Shark anxiously wait to hear if Mr. Wolf got work, but they are disappointed. Mr. Snake slithers in to grab his yoga mat. The crew gawks at Mr. Snake's change and doesn't understand how he can be so happy. Mr. Shark thinks they should worry about the Phantom Bandit heists. It's only a matter of time before people blame them for the Phantom's crime spree.<br/><br/>Mr. Wolf spars with Governor Diana Fox. She advises him to win over the town by doing good publicly. Mr. Wolf has an idea and drives to the police station. He and his crew examine the evidence of the heists with Commissioner Misty Luggins. They spot the culprits in the photo and discover that the stolen items contain MacGuffinite.<br/><br/>The team researches and finds that the Lords of Lucha championship title contains the precious metal. They think the Phantom Bandit will strike at the wrestling match. They arrive at the match and spot Mr. Snake with his new girlfriend, Susan. The crew sees the belt hanging over the ring. They deduce that the challenger is the Bandit. They jump into the squared circle and battle for the belt. However, instead of applause, someone frames them for stealing the belt by putting it on Mr. Piranha. Susan hijacks a hotdog cart and saves them. She offers the crew mints, but Mr. Wolf rejects them. Mr. Wolf asks Susan to pull over so he can call Diane and explain that they are innocent. Mr. Wolf returns the van to find the Bad Guys asleep. Susan shoots Mr. Wolf with a dart.<br/><br/>The team wakes up to the Bad Girls. Pig Tails is the muscle. During the match, she hid in plain sight as the challenging luchador. Susan is Doom, a sweet-talker and long-con expert. The mastermind, Kitty Kat, introduces herself. She wants the Bad Guy to help them with their next heists. Mr. Wolf says no. Kitty Kat threatens to expose Diane's secret life as the Crimson Paw if he doesn't assist. Mr. Wolf agrees, but he assures his crew that he has an ace up his sleeve. Can the Bad Guys do good and protect Diane's reputation?<br/><br/>This sequel is better than the first. The capers are more outlandish, the jokes are funnier, and the plot delves deeper. This story handles reform and redemption. The animation jumps genres throughout the fight scenes. Typically, this feels disjointed. It works because the graphic artist continued this change throughout the entire film. It makes the art feel more alive and enveloping. Be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene. It gives insight into the plot for The Bad Guys 3. This picture has the crime style of Leverage, the smoothness of Ocean's Eleven, and the fun of The Fast and the Furious. The entire family will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Hutch sits in a police station with a dog beside him. He ignites a lighter and uses it to cauterize his wound. The police demand to know who they are. Hutch takes a deep breath and ponders his response. To the outside world, Hutch is married to real estate agent Becca. They raise two children, Sammy and Brady, in a happy and loving environment. However, the underworld knows Hutch as an accountant. At home, Hutch is a man who puts work over family. Becca misses him at dinner time and informs Hutch. She mentions the kids' upcoming summer vacation. Hutch promises to plan everything.<br/><br/>Days later, Hutch shows the family an old video of Plummersville. Hutch has fond memories of that place because it was the only time his father, David, took him and his brother, Harry, on a trip.<br/><br/>Hutch and his family play games at an arcade. Brady gives his extra tickets to a pretty girl and the rest to his sister. Sammy trades her tickets for a badger as Max approaches. He accuses Brady of flirting with his girlfriend, steals Sammy's badger, and rips off its head. As they exit, one of the guards hits Sammy in the back of the head. With a ruse, Hutch reenters the arcade without his family and takes out the guards. The police arrest him and Brady.<br/><br/>The family waits at the police station for Abe. Abe brings Hutch to his office and stands at the corner. Wyatt sits at Abe's desk and states that he runs this town. He demands that Hutch leave and never return. Hutch agrees but stays. Abe's goons spot Hutch and his family at the water park.  Wyatt orders Abe to rid the town of Hutch. He doesn't know who Hutch is, but he understands that Hutch will bring problems to Lendina's business. Lendina is a ruthless bootlegger who will kill anyone who disrupts her cash flow, including Wyatt. Hutch won't budge because he and his family need this time together. No one will ruin this nobody's vacation.<br/><br/>This sequel doesn't follow the action genre pattern. It doesn't put Hutch in a new, exotic location to go on the hunt. Instead, he travels to a small town for family time. This charming and dry comedy features the original cast. It has more explosions, blood, and wall-to-wall action. The fight sequences combine John Wick with Home Alone. The director found exciting and cringy ways to include a funhouse, waterslide, and ball pit. And Lendina is a quirky villain who lives on bloodlust. This film adds to the franchise, not by expanding the world, but by enlightening the audience to Hutch's family. This film is an entertaining, mindless good time.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sonny finishes his race, collects his meager winnings, and leaves to find the next challenge. He hears a voice behind him and sees a familiar face, Ruben. Ruben and Sonny competed in the past, but now Ruben owns a racing team, APEX GP. However, APEX GP has yet to win a race. If APEX GP doesn't win, the board will remove Ruben. Ruben's best driver, Joshua, is highly skilled but young. Ruben wants Sonny to join his team and bring maturity to it. Ruben believes that Joshua and Sonny could win F1 and bring credibility to APEX GP. So Ruben leaves him a first-class ticket to their training track.<br/><br/>Joshua tries out their new car but notices some issues. Sonny arrives as Joshua reports his findings. Joshua's manager, Cash, pulls him aside. Joshua needs to make a good impression over the next few races. Cash believes APEX GP is going down. If Joshua ranks on the leaderboard, another team could open up a spot for him. Sonny thinks the team can win, but they must make changes to the car. Ruben agrees. While Sonny races to overcome his past, Joshua wants to keep his career. Can APEX GP survive with two men competing for the number one spot?<br/><br/>This film has the high-octane fun of Days of Thunder with witty banter. It pays respect to the intricacies and dangers of racing. The audience sees the split decisions, track sabotage, and teamwork in racing. The film uses F1 drivers and scenarios to increase the drama and urgency. The viewer will feel it in their chest as they get a cockpit view of the track. However, this film isn't solely about the race. It also covers espionage and sabotage, but the writers make the audience connect the clues of who is responsible. While the film is lengthy, it delivers an original competitive racing story.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Russ learned that his father had a stroke, and now he has to fly to London to be at his bedside. He asks Hank to care for his cat, Buddy. Later, Yvonne gathers the litter box and brings it into Hank's bathroom.<br/><br/>After closing the bar, Hank comes home to see two men, Aleksei and Pavel, knocking on Russ's door. They ask Hank for Russ's location, but he refuses to give it to them. They ruptured his kidney, so a doctor had to remove it. Curious, Hank enters Russ's apartment to search it. He escapes when the mobsters return. Hank calls the police.<br/><br/>Detective Elise Roman interviews Hank about the intruders. She informs Hank that Russ is a drug dealer, working for some hardcore criminals. Elise says the Russians are dangerous, but Hasidic gangsters, Lipa and Shmully, are monsters. She gives him a number in case Hank sees the mobster and gangsters again. Hank enters his bathroom and notices something strange in the litter box. One poop is fake and hides a key. Hank runs to his job with the key in hand. His boss, Paul, convinces Hank to drink. Hank gets drunk and returns home. He pukes on the exterior door, takes off his clothes, and enters his apartment.<br/><br/>Inside, Aleksei and Pavel are waiting for him with mobster Colorado. They want the key and torture Hank for it. Hank tells them it's in the litter box, but it's missing. Hank remembers he took it to the bar. They demand that he obtain the key and not call the cops. If Hank doesn't find the key, they vow to kill him and everyone he loves.<br/><br/>Based on Caught Stealing by Charlie Huston, this film is action-packed and surprisingly witty. The storytelling is interconnected and intelligent. Every object, character, and monologue has a deeper meaning and merges into the conclusion. The director didn't choose fancy angles to narrate the story. Instead, they used New York and baseball as the backdrop. The natural light and languages make the tale feel authentic. This film is for you if you enjoy crime comedies with an enigma.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Ash follows Hoffman through the city and watches him board the train. Ash retreats to his lair, stashes a copy of the documents in his safe, and burns envelopes meant for the press. He attends his AA meeting and listens to new messages from potential clients.<br/><br/>Whistleblower Sarah meets with a lawyer. She discovered that her employer, Cybo Sementis, did not disclose the harmful side effects of the new food additive. When they discovered she had a copy of the email and its contents, the company sent goons to harass her. The lawyer alerts Sarah to legal routes she can take under whistleblower protection laws. However, she wants to return the documents to stop the harassment. The lawyer informs her about a service that deals with this sensitive matter. He gives her a number and tells her to leave a message. If they choose her case, they will call back.<br/><br/>Sarah arrives at a safe house, calls the number, and leaves a message. She gets a call from the Tri-State Relay. The calls aren't recorded and are confidential. She agrees to take the call. Ash accepts her case, but she must follow his directions without question. Any failure on her part will void their deal. She will be a lamb to the slaughter. Sarah agrees, and Ash puts his plan into motion. However, Cybo Sementics won't bow down without a fight.<br/><br/>This movie is a battle of wits with low-tech solutions. Ash doesn't use a hacker or a crew to flush out Sarah's harassers. Instead, he uses the relay service, the post office, and cunning to stay one step ahead. During the opening sequence, you never hear Ash speak. Ash feels like a mythical character. This movie waits for the height of the climax to stun you. It's a long-forgotten plot point that knocks you out of your seat. The slick presentation pacifies you into a sense of relaxation, so you don't see what the writer is preparing. This moral dilemma is a highly entertaining and captivating spy thriller.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

His teacher, Mr. Hill, doesn't teach American History from the textbooks. He encourages his students to be free-thinkers, question authority, and demand change in the Jim Crow South. Mr. Hill sees promise in Elwood and gives Elwood a pamphlet for a free college. Elwood decides to hitchhike to the school and apply. A man pulls over and offers Elwood a ride. Later, police pull the man over. They arrest the man and Elwood for stealing the car. The judge sends Elwood to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school for boys.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Elwood to uncover that the staff treats black and white students differently. He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it. This film is an extraordinary watch if you can handle it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She dreams of being a wrestler, but every state bans women in the squared circle. Mildred and her mother, Bertha, attend a wrestling match and watch Billy Wolfe win.<br/><br/>Billy and his son, G. Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie. He offers to train her the next day.<br/><br/>Mildred arrives at the carnival, and Billy and G. Bill sit outside the ring. To prove her worth, Billy has Mildred face a man. She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Anna wants to give Harper a ride and tells Tess to relax. Therapist Tess hangs up, finishes her podcast, and kisses her husband, Ryan, goodbye. Finally, Anna opens the door and finds Harper's note. Harper started her morning with surfing.<br/><br/>In the car, Harper groans about her chemistry partner, Lily. Harper thinks Lily is obnoxious. Tess and Anna advise Harper to keep an open mind before dropping Harper off at school. That treaty is non-existent. Lily and Harper argue during chemistry class, causing a foam explosion. The principal calls Anna and Lily's dad, Chef Eric, into school. They run into each other in the halls and fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged.<br/><br/>Lily and Harper disagree during a school bake sale, triggering a school-wide food fight. The tension in the home is rising between Harper and Lily. Anna tells them that they will attend her bachelorette party and get along.<br/><br/>At the bachelorette party, a multi-hyphenate psychic, Madame Jen, offers to give Anna and Tess a reading. Lily and Harper argue in the corner, and Madame Jen interrupts them. Madame Jen tells them, 'Change the hearts you know are wrong, so that you may find where you belong.' Harper thinks she belongs in LA and Lily London. The four feel an earthquake. Tess and Anna try to ignore it.<br/><br/>Harper, Tess, Lily, and Anna return to Tess's home. They make Lily and Harper sleep in the living room to force them to be friendly. They sleep through the night. When Harper wakes up, her face and hands feel dry. Tess hears her daughter's yell and wakes on the couch. She notices her bones feel better. She's in Lily's body. Tess and Lily switched, like Anna and Harper. They ask Harper and Lily if Madame June said anything to break the curse. They lie and say no. Lily and Harper will use the swap to break up their parents' wedding. A wedding that happens in a few days. Can they swap back before the wedding, if there is a wedding?<br/><br/>Sound the alarm! This sequel respects the original while being a multigenerational, heartfelt, funny film. Like the first movie, the script features a wedding on the line, with a new husband, but changes by adding a relocation and Lily's deceased mother. For the die-hard fans, everyone returns. The Pink Slips, Harry, and Mama P make a satisfying comeback for the fans. The writers hide easter eggs with the soundtrack, decor, jokes, and food. Freakier Friday is a comedy with great timing and physicality. It celebrates complicated family dynamics without muting anyone's perspectives or feelings. You will leave this movie as you did the first, feeling seen and seeing. This film is a sequel that's worth seeing in theaters and is worth the wait.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Raymond Garraty, along with 49 other young men, received a letter from The Major. Out of the applicants from his state, the Major chose him to participate in the long walk. The winner will receive a monetary prize and one wish. Garraty's mother, Ginnie, cries as she delivers her son to the starting point. She begs him to quit, but the deadline was yesterday. He grabs his gear and baseball before hugging Ginnie goodbye.<br/><br/>Garraty enters the gates and sits with the other young men. He meets Peter McVries, a man who wishes to do good with the prize. Stebbins is the strongest of the bunch. Arthur Baker's faith inspires him, and Hank Wang focuses on the untold riches. Gary Barkovitch is a loner, and Collie Parker wants to document the experience. Then, the Major walks onto the tank and explains the rules. They must walk 3 miles per hour with no finish line in sight. If they slow down, they get one warning and have 30 seconds to regroup. The third warning means death. They will face instant death if they run away or step off the pavement. It's walk or die. While others want riches, Garraty has another reason to enter this competition: revenge. Who will win?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Long Walk by Stephen King, this dystopian thriller shares similarities with the original, but it's not a retelling. However, the film retains the book's impact. The director made a bold choice by using natural lighting and empty surroundings to draw the audience's focus to the contestants. Also, the surroundings mirror their despair. The graphics department didn't shy away from the blood and gore. Unlike the Hunger Games, the Major is not a man of reason. He is unflappable, rigid, and single-minded. Also, the juxtaposition of the final stretch breaks your heart. The winner breaks down in gut-wrenching sobs as the crowd celebrates with fireworks and the national anthem. It's a moment that will stick with you after the film. The studio labeled the film a horror, but it's a warning. You should see this film if you can stomach the unflinching violence.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Rocketman joins other members of the French 75 outside of an immigration center. Perfidia sees him and asks what's in his wagon. He explains that it's explosive, and she's intrigued. As Rocketman sets the explosives, other members gather the immigrants and detain the soldiers. Perfidia distracts Captain Lockjaw. Her take-charge attitude arouses him as she steals his hat and gun. She, the team, and the immigrants exit the center, using Rocketman's explosions as a distraction.<br/><br/>The French 45 set up political attacks everywhere, but don't know that Lockjaw has fixated on Perfidia. He follows them on their next mission and corners her in a bathroom. He offers to let her go if she meets him at a hotel with his gun and hat. If not, he will expose her crew. She slithers away and completes the mission. Then, she joins Lockjaw in a hotel room and leaves sans hat and gun.<br/><br/>Eight months later, Perfidia is pregnant, and Rocketman worries that she is ignoring it. After their daughter's birth, Perfidia becomes jealous of the time Rocketman spends with their little girl, Charlene. During a grocery run, Lockjaw stands behind Rocketman and asks about the baby. He states it's a girl and biracial.<br/><br/>Perfidia gathers a team to rob a bank to fund the French 75. During the robbery, Perfidia shoots and kills a security officer. The police catch and detain her. Lockjaw gives her an option: give up the crew or die in jail. Perfidia turns state's evidence and enters the witness protection program. The French 75 hears about Perfidia's capture and runs to protect Rocketman and Charlene. They give him a trust device, new identities as Bob and Willa, and a nearby sanctuary city. Lockjaw returns to Perfidia after the roundup, but she's fled to Mexico.<br/><br/>Sixteen years later, a man approaches Colonel Lockjaw with an invitation to an exclusive club, the Christmas Adventurers. They are a group that believes in strong borders, family values, and purity. Then, they inquire about interracial relationships. Lockjaw says he has only slept with women of his race. They inform him that they will conduct a double Yankee background check into his past. Lockjaw leaves with his head full of pride, but he has one problem: Charlene. She could be evidence of his night with Perfidia. He sends the army to locate her and bring her to him.<br/><br/>Willa attends high school and isn't allowed to have a phone. Bob hasn't disclosed much about his past, but tells Willa her mom was a hero who fought for everyone's freedom. Willa attends a school dance and goes to the bathroom. Her trust device starts to make noise, and Deandra gives Willa the passphrase. Under Deandra's instructions, Willa leaves the party with her. Bob receives a phone call that the army captured a former member looking for Willa. Bob, in a stupor, enters a tunnel, grabs his gear, and runs to locate Willa. He must keep her safe from Lockjaw before Lockjaw exposes the truth about him, her mother, and Bob. Can Bob save Willa?<br/><br/>Inspired by Viceland by Thomas Pynchon, this film begins as a revolutionary heist film and changes to a game of chess. The director didn't concentrate on title cards or clothing to give the film's period. It's left up to the viewer to decide. The writers centered on the mission while illuminating issues such as immigration, the undocumented workforce, history, and lineage. The natural lighting and close-up allowed the cinematography to maintain its gritty edge. The script is sharp-witted, charming, and edgy. This film makes you laugh and flinch. However, the writers don't want to change ideals or force policy. They focus on telling a compelling story that captivates from start to finish.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
