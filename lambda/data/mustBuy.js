    "mtitle":"Cruella",
    "review":"Estella was the odd girl out from birth.  With her natural black and white hair, she was born to stand out.  Her mother, Katherine, helped nurture her love of fashion but observed Estella had a mean streak.  She told her daughter that her name was Estella, not Cruella. At school, Estella became a bully magnet, but she gave as good as she got. With Estella's violent reputation, Katherine decides to travel to London for a fresh start.  But first, Katherine has to visit a friend to get some money.  Outside Hellman House, Katherine gives Estella her necklace, a family heirloom, and tells Estella to wait in the car with Buddy, her dog.  When Buddy escapes, Estella follows him into the house.  Inside, Estella finds the glamour of a Winter Fashion Show.  Soon, security discovers Estella and throws her out with dalmatians chasing after her. The dalmatians jump over her and hit Katherine, pushing her off a cliff. Estella runs to London, but later, sees the necklace is gone.  On her first day there, she meets Jasper and Horace, two street kids with no parents. They decide to team up, but she has to dye her unmistakable hair first.  Ten years later, Estella uses her love of fashion to create disguises for them as they rob the town.  However, Jasper observes Estella staring at the Liberty of London store sign all the time.  So, he steals an application acceptance for her.  Estella believes she is on the right path to being the woman Katherine wanted.  However, this is the first step of introducing the world to Cruella de Vil and her poetic justice for her necklace, fashion, and Katherine.  The Baroness, the Liberty of London's owner and famed fashion designer, has met her match.<br/><br/>Based on The One Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith and Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians by Bill Peet, this movie is a feast for your eyes and ears.  With eye-popping fashion and a host of colors, Cruella's black, white, and red stand out like her hair. This soundtrack follows the format of Guardians of the Galaxy while being a nod to the era. You will laugh at the Baroness's psychotic actions, but secretly, you will want to be her, all the while wanting Cruella to destroy her. Sit back with the family and enjoy Disney's newest classic with a captivating plot twist.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"After the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne, known as Batman, can't forget the warning Lex Luther gave him.  Lex warned something big is coming that will destroy all humankind.  So, Batman does the one thing he never thought he would do: team-up.  First, Bruce went to a small fishing village to find the sea protector, Arthur Curry.  Arthur, better known as Aquaman, gives Bruce a few choice words then disappears.  Diana overhears that the Shrine of the Amazons is on fire, and she knows it's a signal from her mother, the Queen of the Amazons.  She goes to the shrine, opens a cave, and reads the writings on the wall. In the past, man, Amazons, Atlanteans, Gods, and protectors of the stars got together to fight Darkseid and won.  After the battle, Darkseid left 3 Mother Boxes behind. For years, the boxes slept.  However, the Amazon's box awakens, and Steppenwolf followed the call.  He stole the first box from them, and he is on the hunt for the other two.  If he gets them and performs The Unity, the veil between Earth and Darkseid will fall. Bruce tells Diana that Arthur said no, so they decide to split up, go after the other two metahumans, and convince them to join the team.  Soon, they will realize that they need one more member, Superman.  His life kept Darkseid at bay and the Mother Boxes asleep, but they will have to find a way to bring him back to defeat the dark forces to come.  Lois is the key.<br/><br/>After fans demanded this version, they got four hours of what they wanted. Yes!!! This movie is four hours long with six parts and an epilogue.  Each part adds something new to the characters that we haven't seen before. Also, the plot gives us the origin story of the Mother Boxes, Steppenwolf, and the ultimate weapon.  With more time, the CGI team fixed some of the horrible graphics in the first film. And within this retelling, the writers give an alternate ending that feels like a love letter to the fans.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The neighborhood of Washington Heights has people with dreams in every home.  Usnavi runs the bodega and plans to go to Puerto Rico to re-open his father's bar. Every morning, Usnavi greets Abuela Claudia.  With no kids, Claudia helped raise every kid in Washington Heights. In his bodega, Usnavi sells coffee, food, and lotto tickets to his neighbors, like Kevin, Nina, Benny, and his crush, Vanessa.  Kevin owns a car service and anxiously awaits the arrival of his daughter, Nina, after selling half of his store to send her to Stanford.  Nina is happy to be back on her block, but she worries that her news will disappoint the neighborhood.  Sonny, Usnavi's cousin, works in the bodega and dreams of going to college, but he is too young to understand the obstacle in his way.  Benny works for Kevin and has a crush on Nina. Vanessa wants to move out of Washington Heights and start a fashion label, but she needs to wait for a credit approval to get her dream apartment downtown.  Whether their dream is on the A-train, in the neighborhood, or on another island, they will not stop until they reach it.  Good thing someone has a winning 96,000 dollar lotto ticket in their hands.<br/><br/>Dare you to watch this movie without a tear in your eye.  Based on the award-winning play, someone in this movie will resonate with you.  Their passion, strength, and pride will pull you into each character's story while seeing them dance and sing about their struggles and joy. The music and lyrics will have you dancing and singing along. Like their dreams, each subject is complex and unique.  While they all grew up in the same neighborhood, they are not the same people. If musicals aren't your style, you should still give this one a try.  It will open you to an experience and mindset that many ignore.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gunner sits in his room and writes his graphic novel about Detective Knoxx, a ghost attempting to solve his murder. When Gunner tells his parents, Amos and Mary, that he went to a funeral for more research, Amos can't hide his disbelief. In an attempt to connect with Gunner, Amos walks into Gunner's room to play catch, but Amos steps on his graphic novel, ruining it.  Gunner leaves and rides his bike around town.  On his ride, he sees an abandoned mill with The Water Man painted on the side.  He hears a young girl, Jo, telling a group of kids that she encountered The Water Man and survived. Back at home, Gunner tries to sleep but has a nightmare.  He searches for Mary and finds a frail, bald figure in the bathroom.  Gunner had no idea that Mary's leukemia advanced so aggressively.  Instead of researching detective novels, Gunner focuses on leukemia and anatomy.  Inside one of the books, Gunner finds notes about The Water Man.  Since the author is local, Gunner goes to Bussey's home to get more information.  Bussey explains that The Water Man found a vein of shiny material in a cave and he carved a rock out of it. When the dam broke, everyone in the town, including The Water Man's wife, died.  But The Water Man lived, and he believed it was because of the shining rock he found.  The rock made him immortal.  Now, he searches the woods for his wife's body to give her immortality. Gunner wants to find The Water Man to heal Mary.  And he knows just who can help find The Water Man, Jo. With two kids in the woods, Amos goes on a hunt to find Gunner without telling Mary.  Amos knows he is on borrowed time because there is a danger roaring in the woods that will annihilate Gunner and Jo.  And it isn't The Water Man.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo's directorial debut is a promising award contender this year.  Mixing animation with real-life allows the viewer to see life in Gunner's rich fantasy world. This movie isn't only about Gunner finding The Water Man.  It's about Gunner and Amos finding common ground. By being apart, they call for each other in the darkness and find their bond.  It's a compelling story that will resonate with the whole family.  Be warned, there are a few scary moments, but those are short-lived and explained.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She wows the famous crowd.  Since her parents' divorce, Aretha spends some days with her mom, Barbara, but resides with Clarence and her grandmother. A couple of years later, Aretha was a mother of two but refused to name the father.  She sings at marches for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but Aretha wants to do more for the movement. When Aretha announces that she wants to march, Clarence has a surprise for her.  He talked to record companies about Aretha, and a record company in New York wants to sign her.  Four albums later, Aretha doesn't have a hit record.  Dinah tells Aretha to stop being so proper and find her voice.  It will take new management, two husbands, and a drinking problem for Aretha to find her voice in a path she made, one song at a time.<br/><br/>Following the treacherous example set by Clarence, Aretha went from one controlling man to another. She admired leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Angela Davis, but Aretha didn't know how to stand up for herself.  In meetings, the record producers, tour managers, and her father made the decisions while Aretha sat quietly. She existed with unspeakable pain that followed her, and her family calls it her demon.  It will take a Times article, a heavenly spirit, and a choir director for Aretha to shake that demon and create the best album of her career.  Having an actress that can do Aretha's voice justice, was the best move by the director.  You didn't lose focus with bad dubbing or bad acting.  This story of triumph and its honest telling will inspire and move you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She gets T.D.K, Savant, Black guard, Javelin, Mongal, and Weasel to join. While this team is a formidable opponent for any enemy, Waller created another without telling Flag.  This team consists of Nanaue, Bloodsport, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and Peacemaker.  These teams have to travel to Corto Maltese and infiltrate the Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory.  The Thinker is conducting experiments with alien technology to overthrow the American government.  After Team A fails, leaving Harley Quinn and Rick Flag prisoners, Team B will go on a bloody rampage to complete the mission.<br/><br/>O.M.G! James Gunn added the wit of Deadpool to the blood and guts of The Kingsman with Tarantino storytelling.  This movie not only holds up to its name, but it gives you the darkness you would expect from a D.C. comic.  While you are enjoying the often-uncomfortable humor, you see awe-inspiring juxtaposition in many fight scenes. The camera angles and framing give the viewer a different view of each fight scene. Seeing the first movie isn't necessary to enjoy this film. This movie is worth the theater price but not for kids nor tweens.

It puts Captain Marvel and Spider-Man to shame.  And let's never forget the fight between Wenwu and Jiang Li.  Their combative dance of love and power is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Keys, created a world with AI.  People can watch as the NPCs learn, grow, and develop lives.  While Keys works for Soonami and its owner Antwan, Millie sued them.  She believes Antwan stole their base code to create Free City.  She spends her time in the game trying to find the proof on an unseen level. At first, Millie needed Guy to prove her case, but now she will need Guy to save himself, Free City, and his friends before Antwan destroys the servers.<br/><br/>This movie speaks to anyone who felt like a background character in their lives. While this movie inspires, it highlights issues in the gaming world.  This mix of Jumanji: The Next Level, Ready Player One, and The Lego Movie has memorable moments, laughable dialogue, a love story, and lots of easter eggs.  In the end, you will learn that someone created Guy with a purpose, and he isn't any ordinary NPC.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Once all the players, plots, and bullets are in place, the knockdown, drag-out fight begins.  Be aware there are no wasted moments on screen.  The broadcasts, backstories, and jokes have a point to the overall plot. This movie takes its time, but it's worth every second to see these opposing forces battle it out.  Based on the ending, maybe we will get a part two.  Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
