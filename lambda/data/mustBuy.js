    "review": "British Intelligence Officer George meets with his boss, Meacham, in an alleyway. Meacham informs George that a nuclear program called Severus leaked. He gives George a list of five people with the knowledge, skill, and clearance level to obtain Severus. George's wife, Kathryn, is on the list. George vows to find the mole in a week.<br/><br/>George returns home and plans a dinner with the suspects. However, he warns Kathryn to avoid one item because it contains drugs. Agents James, Zoe, Freddie, and Clarissa arrive. James and Freddie are field agents. James is in a relationship with agency psychiatrist Dr. Zoe, and Freddie is dating satellite analyst Clarissa. As the drugs take effect, everyone becomes unencumbered and reveals secrets. After everyone leaves, George finds a movie ticket stub for Dark Window in the trash.<br/><br/>George and Kathryn prepare for work. He asks her to go to the movies with him to see Dark Window. She states that she hasn't heard of it. She will be on a mission tomorrow. George inquires about it, but she says, 'Black Bag.' They use the term to hide classified information about their job without lying. However, George wonders if Kathryn lied about the movie. He will investigate his colleagues and the love of his life. Can George uncover the rat and find Severus while keeping his marriage?<br/><br/>This movie is exciting in its simplicity. You don't get constant action like in Mission Impossible but an intriguing mystery with spies like Hercule Poirot. The opening scene has a hypnotizing tracking shot that follows George as he searches for Meacham. Every scene, conversation, and object has a purpose to the enigma. Unlike other thrillers, the script had two impactful meetings that involved all the suspects. The first is a dinner that allows George to probe for information. The second is the unveiling. This meeting is brisk but reveals a lot of information in five minutes. So keep your ears open. This movie will cause many spirited discussions and a few laughs while entertaining. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Chris Lemons spends time with his fianc√©e, Morag, planning paint colors for their baby's room. Morag expresses concern about Chris's job as a saturation diver, but Chris thinks it's cool. He reassures Morag that everything is okay before driving to Aberdeen Harbour. Chris greets friends on the ship and learns from fellow diver Duncan that they have a new Captain. Then, teammates tell Chris that 'Vulcan' is joining them on this dive. The divers meet with their coordinator, Craig. Craig divides the divers into four teams of three. Duncan, Chris, and the 'Vulcan' - whose name is Dave - are on team A..<br/><br/>The men spend time in the pod while the crew pressurizes it to prepare for their dive. After some time, each team makes the dive in their pod. They will take turns repairing the gas pipeline. They dive, and Craig chooses Team A to go to the subsea manifold first. Chris and Dave will dive while Duncan monitors their umbilical cables and air levels from above. Duncan opens the hatch, and the water rushes inside. He knows it's a sign of a 20-foot swell above. Craig confirms Duncan's suspicions, but the team continues.<br/><br/>While Chris and Dave work on the manifold, they don't know what's happening above until the umbilical cable retracts without Duncan's assistance. The thrusters on the ship failed, and the vessel, connected to their pod, drifts further into the sea. Dave and Chris climb the manifold as the ship pulls. Then, Chris's umbilical cable snags on the manifold. Duncan warns Chris that his cable will snap under the strain. Knowing that the vessel will pull him before he can help Chris, Dave tells Chris to climb the manifold after the cable breaks. He can't save Chris if he can't find him. His cable breaks. Chris falls, and the ship pulls Dave away. Dave rejoins a somber Duncan. They can't rescue Chris until the vessel stops drifting. Chris has 10 minutes of air before he dies. Can the vessel's crew stop the drift so Dave and Duncan can return to save Chris?<br/><br/>Based on the Last Breath documentary, this movie only gives the audience a brief moment to understand the characters and their work. However, it's enough to have you waiting with bated breath as they count down Chris's air supply. Your heart will drop when the countdown changes from time with air to time without it. The camera work doesn't make you the diver but turns you into a fish in the ocean. You swim around the divers while they work and struggle. This film will take you through a roller coaster of emotions without crass humor. This film is a must-see in theaters.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Tom and Maddie revel in the quiet when a beam of light comes from a helicopter. Director Rockwell exits and asks for Team Sonic's help. An alien escaped a private base in Tokyo. And they can't catch him. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles board the helicopter.<br/><br/>Team Sonic lands in Tokyo and can't believe the alien standing before them looks like Sonic. His name is Shadow. Sonic chases after him, but Shadow outsmarts him. The team meets Commander Walters at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Commander Walters explains that Shadow landed on Earth 50 years ago inside a meteorite. They hid him in a top-secret base to study his powers under the guidance of a professor. The professor's granddaughter, Maria, bonded with Shadow and became best friends. Then, an accident at the base took Maria's life. Now that Shadow is free, he wants revenge for Maria.<br/><br/>Hours ago, someone hacked their system and lowered their defenses. Reports state that Dr. Robotnik's symbol emerged on the screen during the hack. Then, Robotnik's drones enter the restaurant and aim for the team after fatally wounding Commander Walters. Walters hands Sonic a key to a powerful weapon. A motorcyclist rides into the restaurant, incapacitates the attack drones, and exits. The team follows the cyclist until he stops. It's Agent Stone. He says someone framed Dr. Robotnik, and he has proof.<br/><br/>Agent Stone takes the team to Dr. Robotnik's lair. When he learns someone stole his tech, Dr. Robotnik chooses to work with Team Sonic to find the culprit. However, he needs something from Sonic. Sonic rolls his eyes and pulls out a quill. This unlikely mash-up must stop Shadow's revenge and keep the key out of the wrong person's hands.<br/><br/>It may be unbelievable, but this film is the best of the trilogy. First, this adventure is worldwide. Second, this film is about the toxic nature of anger and revenge. Third, this movie respects its core audience by referencing old tech, movies, and jokes. However, it doesn't forget its new fans. The movie kept a steady pace while introducing new characters. The plot didn't waste time recapping the last films. This film is an animated action-adventure comedy for the whole family with mid- and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

His teacher, Mr. Hill, doesn't teach American History from the textbooks. He encourages his students to be free-thinkers, question authority, and demand change in the Jim Crow South. Mr. Hill sees promise in Elwood and gives Elwood a pamphlet for a free college. Elwood decides to hitchhike to the school and apply. A man pulls over and offers Elwood a ride. Later, police pull the man over. They arrest the man and Elwood for stealing the car. The judge sends Elwood to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school for boys.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Elwood to uncover that the staff treats black and white students differently. He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it.

One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie.

She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Smoke and Stack want Sammie to play at their establishment.<br/><br/>The crowd gathers at the juke joint for fun, singing, and dancing. Soon, Stack gets word that his ex-girlfriend, Mary, is in attendance. Stack tells her to leave, but Mary refuses.<br/><br/>During the performances, three people approach the juke joint. Remmick, Bert, and Joan heard Sammie's performance and wanted to play. However, the twins don't believe they will be comfortable and could cause trouble, so they don't invite the trio inside. Mary discovers the twins haven't made enough money and wants to meet the trio to determine trustworthiness. The juke joint is about to dance with the devil. Will they survive?<br/><br/>This movie turns the overworked vampire genre into something special with the 1930s backdrop and spectacular score. The film opens with a brief introduction to a shared folklore. There's music so enchanting that it can pierce the veil between the past and future, the living and the dead, and invite evil. As the tune plays, the director adds past and present music styles along with different types of dancers. It makes the opening sequence come to life and transports you into the world in between. Also, the scenes with the twins interacting are nearly flawless, but the blood scenes are a bit over the top. This movie is captivating, educational, and a tad scary. However, stay for the mid and post-credit scenes. The director, writers, and composers made this film for the big screen.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

They assume their enemy is Yelena. However, they will battle the void inside all of them.<br/><br/>Marvel fans, you asked for a more story-driven and gritty MCU. This movie delivers. The opening sequence changed. It only includes pages from the comic books. Then, the music and image go dark. Most of the audience has experienced feelings of loneliness, nothingness, sadness, shame, and even depression. This film is the physical manifestation of that. The film's quips are original, funny, and perfectly acted and timed. The only downfall is the first battle scene between Bob and the Thunderbolts. It's reminiscent of Hulk and Loki. It's cartoonish and overly computerized at a time of seriousness. If this is the new direction of the MCU, then they need to stay on this path. Viewers should remain for the mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
