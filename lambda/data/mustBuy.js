    "review":"When Claudia receives the news her son Lennon was dead, she was heartbroken.  However, her grief turned to rage when the police declared it a suicide.  She knows her son would never kill himself.  He was happy and making plans for the future.  So Lennon's brother Pierre started investigating.  His results will lead to this case being presented to the F.B.I..  Pierre and Claudia hope Lennon's case will be fully and properly investigated.<br/><br/>This documentary will anger you to your core while bringing a heavy sadness on your chest.  As Lennon's family and friends give you a glimpse of Lennon's life, you are endeared to him.  During the documentary, the lynchings of Moore's Ford and Claude Neal are discussed in great detail.  Hearing first-hand accounts are eye-opening and allow the viewer to see these crimes as a thing of the present.  The film does point the finger at someone but doesn't allow that person to present themselves to the audience.  It's crucial to the validity of the accusations.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Poppy is enjoying her reign as a queen with dignity and song.  Branch still lives in his bunker.  He has fallen in love with Poppy and doesn’t know how to tell her.  As the trolls celebrate the birth of Tiny Diamond, Poppy gets a letter from a rock star.  Queen Barb of the Rock Trolls plans to come to Pop Village and create one nation under Rock.  King Peppy reveals the Troll’s history to Poppy.  Many years ago, there were six strings that played different types of music: Pop, Country, Classical, Rock, Techno, and Funk.  Over time, they became intolerant of each other’s music and started to fight.  Each troll musical faction took their string and left.  Poppy refuses to run and wants to protect her kingdom.  She fires up a hot air balloon to find Queen Barb and the other factions.  Then, have a party to unite all the trolls with her pop sound.  Branch sees it differently.  He believes that Queen Barb is ready for a fight and prepares to fight back. So, he reluctantly joins Poppy.  Meanwhile, Queen Barb has gotten Poppy’s reply of friendship and she is disgusted.  She wants to unite the strings to make all the trolls Rock Zombies by playing the Ultimate Power Chord.  When every troll is the same, no one will fight.  As both Queens start their mission, they will learn the beauty of individuality, respect, and how history is written.<br/><br/>Based on Good Luck Trolls and the sequel to Trolls, this rainbow blast includes music for all ages and genres like Dee-Lite, Cyndi Lauper, Beethoven, Spice Girls, George Clinton, Baha Men, PSY, Chic, Scorpions, Daft Punk, and more.  Unlike other movies that teach children togetherness, it praises individuality through a groove, a riff, or a yodel.  With this storyline, you get 2 subplots.  The first subplot, Branch is finding a way to express his love for Poppy.  The second subplot, Cooper is finding his real family and music faction.  As a strong spectacle of entertainment, it surpasses the first movie and leaves you wanting more movies in the future.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A dozen people wake up in a field with bits in their mouths and locks on the bits’ buckle.  They have no idea where they are or how they got there.  They find a crate in the middle of the field with a crowbar by its side.  Only one man grabs the crowbar and opens it.  The man opens the crate and a pig wearing a shirt comes out.  The man pulls a rack filled with weapons.   As people come to grab a weapon, a young girl finds a key.  The key unlocks the bits.  They gather weapons and start to talk when shots ring through the air.  Only half make it out the field and into the woods.  The six don’t know they are part of a hunt.  Liberal elites have chosen them to travel to the manor and be hunted.  They made one mistake: Underestimating Crystal.<br/><br/>Based on The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell, this movie takes a swipe at everyone.  The Hunt is The Hunger Games and Kill Bill all combined into one political satire and mystery.  This movie shows the ugliness and prejudice in everyone.  Whether we like it or not.  If you have a weak stomach, there will be too much gore for you.  Who is the real snowball?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cecilia has put her plan into place.  As Adrian sleeps, she moves the security camera, turns off the alarm, and tracks him in bed on her phone.  She climbs over the cement barrier, runs through the woods and waits for Emily.  As she gets in Emily’s car, she drops the Diazepam she used to drug Adrian.  Emily drives off with Cecilia, leaving Adrian behind.  Adrian finds the bottle on the ground and heads home.  Two weeks later, Cecilia is hiding out in James’s home with his daughter Sydney.  Walking to the mailbox causes Cecilia enormous anxiety.  She knows Adrian is waiting for her to let down her guard.  Emily tells her to relax because Adrian committed suicide.  Cecilia breathes a sigh of relief.  The next day, Cecilia gets a letter from Adrian’s brother Tom.  Tom is the executor of Adrian’s estate.  Adrian left Cecilia $5 million to be paid monthly in $100,000 installments without income taxes or estate taxes.  One night, Cecilia gets a feeling that someone is around but sees no one.  She brushes it off and goes to sleep.  Cecilia is awakened to notice her covers on the floor at the foot of the bed.  She pulls the covers but they are stuck on something.  She stares to see footprints appear out of nowhere.  She snaps them and hears something fall to the floor and runs. James tells her it’s all in her mind.  Then she remembers Adrian's threat.  If you leave me, I will find you.  You won’t see me but I will leave something behind to let you know I was there.  While no one else believes her, she knows Adrian has faked his death and found a way to make himself invisible.<br/><br/>That thought of someone being in the room, someone watching you, or someone listening to you is a feeling we all know too well.  As the camera pans to an empty spot in the room, you will swear you can see Adrian standing there.  Being invisible allows each attack to be shocking.  This modern twist on The Invisible Man novel is a mix of The Invisible Man movie and Enough.  With strong acting, amazing special effects, and killer designs, the plot feels believable.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Democratic strategist, Gary Zimmer is reeling from Hilary Clinton's loss in 2016.  He decides they need a new rural friendly message.  He has found his guy.  One of his aides played Gary a viral video of Colonel Jack Hastings arguing in a town hall meeting in Deerlaken, Wisconsin.  Jack argues against showing IDs to receive public assistance. Gary thinks he can turn Jack into a Democrat, then change the community by getting Jack elected mayor of Deerlaken.  Gary wants Jack to be a fresh face of the Democratic Party with his gruff exterior and left ideas. At first Jack says no, but changes his mind.  Jack has decided to run for mayor. Gary thinks this will be an easy win, but one semicolon will strike fear in his heart.  Republican strategist, Faith Brewster, is in town.<br/><br/>This movie shows the dirty side of politics on both sides.  It poignantly describes how one party leads with fear while the other leads with shame.  While both argue they are morally right, it all comes down to money.  With focus groups, statisticians, and super PACs, the money is the only focus and concern. This movie provides plenty of laughs, satirical undertones of the horrible nature of both parties, and false endings like Vice.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
