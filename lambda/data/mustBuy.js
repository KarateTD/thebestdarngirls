	"review":"In 24 hours, Miles Morales is bitten by a radio active spider, witnesses the death of Spider-Man, is hunted, and discover 5 other Spider-Men.  Each Spider-Man has their own back story, but they have one thing in common: Being a reluctant superhero.  Miles will sadly join this club.  Seeing the seamless mesh of different animation styles with a strong story and great life lessons for kids is superb.

    "review":"In 5 years, the Systar aliens have changed Bricksburg to Apocalypseburg.  Now General Sweet Mayhem has kidnapped Emmet's friends to convince Batman to marry Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi.  Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.  This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
