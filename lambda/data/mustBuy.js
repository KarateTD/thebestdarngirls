    "review": "Li practices Kung Fu in a dojo owned and operated by his uncle, Shifu Han. A student runs in and warns Han that the director, his niece Dr. Fong, is there. She got a job in New York. She and Li will move there and start a new life. Han urges Dr. Fong to let Li continue his training, but she refuses. She makes Li vow to never fight again.<br/><br/>After Dr. Fong and Li move into their New York apartment, Li leaves to find dinner and toilet paper. He walks to Victor's Pizza and orders a stuffed crust. Victor tells Li to find a strip mall. However, Victor's daughter, Mia, offers a softer approach.<br/><br/>After school, Li walks home and sees Mia arguing with a vendor. Li admits his first day was complex. They cross paths with a Kung Fu dojo, and Li freezes and stares into the storefront window. The owner, O'Shea, reminds Mia that Victor owes him money. Mia warns Li to stay away from that dojo. They make an exchange. He will teach her Mandarin if she shows him around New York.<br/><br/>During their first lesson, Li and Mia take the train. They bump into Mia's ex-boyfriend, Conor. He sucker-punches Li as Mia disembarks the train. Conor is the reigning Karate champion and trains at O'Shea's dojo. Conor will defend his championship in the 5 Burroughs Tournament.<br/><br/>Later, Li sees three men harassing Victor, and Li fights them off. Victor, a former boxing champion, asks Li to teach him Kung Fu. A fight is coming up, and O'Shea's thugs will be in attendance. If Victor beats them, he will earn enough money to pay O'Shea. The fight starts well, but O'Shea's fighter throws a dirty punch, landing Victor in the hospital. Li falls into a deep sadness.<br/><br/>Han learns about Li's suffering, so Han travels to New York. He encourages Li to enter the tournament and win the prize money for Victor. However, the competition focuses on Karate, not Kung Fu. To help Li, Han must find Daniel and persuade him to train Li in seven days. Can Li win the competition and add another branch to Miyagi's tree?<br/><br/>The film opens with Mr. Miyagi teaching Daniel the history of Karate. It's a recap of Mr. Miyagi's importance to the franchise. The fight scenes are nearly perfect and include training techniques from the original films. The violence may be too much for younger viewers, but the graphics and commentary give the audience a video game feel. The script handles humor with emotional topics with ease while teaching important life lessons about perseverance, respect, and strength. This film will revitalize the franchise.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The Grand Councilwoman called an emergency meeting of the United Galactic Federation. Scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba created an alien he calls Experiment 626. It's bright, indestructible, and can evade capture. Councilwoman imprisons 626. 626 escapes before the Councilwoman makes it to the ship's deck. He lands in Honolulu, Hawaii. She plans to vaporize the planet until Agent Wendell Pleakley stops her. Earth is a habitat for the endangered mosquito species. Grand Councilwoman tells Wendell and Dr. Jumba to travel to Earth and capture 626 before he wreaks havoc on the planet.<br/><br/>Lilo arrives at her hula recital late and jumps in place. Another dancer, Myrtle, teases Lilo during the performance, so Lilo pushes Myrtle off the stage. When Nani arrives, Lilo is gone. Nani rushes home to apologize, but Lilo locks Nani outside. Nani grabs a brick to break a window when their caseworker, Mrs. Kekoa, arrives. She gives Nani three tasks to complete in four days, or Nani will lose custody. Lilo agrees to be better. Then she sees a shooting star. She pushes Nani out the door and wishes for a best friend.<br/><br/>Lilo's shooting star was 626's crash landing. Unfortunately, 626 runs into oncoming traffic. Then, a tour bus knocks him out. The driver assumes 626 is a dog and brings it to the animal shelter. Soon after 626's arrival, Dr. Jumba and Agent Wendell enter Earth's atmosphere. And CIA Agent Cobra Bubbles searches the woods to discover who or what left a crater.<br/><br/>Nani's neighbor, Tūtū, takes Lilo to the animal shelter. Lilo plays with the dogs and finds a cage with bent wires. She looks around, and a blue dog says hi to her. Lilo believes her shooting star wish worked. Lilo's latest friend will turn her world upside down and test Lilo's understanding of Ohana.<br/><br/>This live-action remake uses the original as its foundation but adds believable aspects to the film. Fans of the original can spot the differences. These changes don't feel like much. However, it changes the direction of the story. The plot centers around Ohana, but the conclusion is more realistic. The graphics between Stitch and the other animated characters are vivid, life-like, and true to the original. Also, the designers took a lot of time perfecting the moments between Stitch and Lilo. However, Stitch's interactions with other humans can be disjointed and bothersome. Disney adaptations have been hit-and-miss in the past, but this film is a gold standard.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

He tells her the best way to feel fulfilled is to do good for her country. Yelena leaves Alexi and calls Valentina. She agrees to do one more job and then become a public figure. Valentina tells Yelana to go to an Ox Corp black site and destroy everything inside, including a target.<br/><br/>Valentina stands before Congress for her impeachment trial. She warns them that the Avengers are gone. They must create new heroes to protect the Earth. Valentina leaves the hearing with her assistant, Mel. She tells Mel to clean everything they can use against her in the hearing.<br/><br/>Congressman Bucky Barnes attends a Battle of New York exhibit with Valentina and Congressman Gary. Bucky runs into Mel and gives her his business card. Then, Bucky pulls Gary aside. He tells Gary that Mel may switch sides. However, Gary wants Bucky to focus on his job.<br/><br/>Yelena arrives at the black site. Then, John Walker hits her. She retaliates but stops because he is not her target. However, she is his. During their battle, Ava, the Ghost, appears and attacks John because Valentina hired her to kill him. They battle, and Taskmaster appears. Ava kills Taskmaster in the battle. The remaining three continue to fight and accidentally hit a button on a box. The box opens and releases Bob. Ava, John, and Yelena argue until they realize that Valentina set them up to kill each other and wipe her slate clean.<br/><br/>Mel second-guesses Valentina's leadership when Valentina instructs Mel to kill her operatives. However, Mel alerts Valentina that they survived and released Bob. She demands that Mel get her to the site and save Bob, but everyone else can die. Valentina and Mel don't know that Alexei is their driver. He drops them off and rushes to warn Yelena. Mel calls Bucky and gives him the details. He rushes to find the three and brings them to the hearing as evidence of Valentina's crimes. Yelena, Bucky, Red Guardian, Ava, and John Walker will form the Thunderbolts. They assume their enemy is Yelena. However, they will battle the void inside all of them.<br/><br/>Marvel fans, you asked for a more story-driven and gritty MCU. This movie delivers. The opening sequence changed. It only includes pages from the comic books. Then, the music and image go dark. Most of the audience has experienced feelings of loneliness, nothingness, sadness, shame, and even depression. This film is the physical manifestation of that. The film's quips are original, funny, and perfectly acted and timed. The only downfall is the first battle scene between Bob and the Thunderbolts. It's reminiscent of Hulk and Loki. It's cartoonish and overly computerized at a time of seriousness. If this is the new direction of the MCU, then they need to stay on this path. Viewers should remain for the mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Pharmaceutical Representative Martin Kerbs sits in traffic while police try to move a dying dinosaur off the road. Since the escape of dinosaurs, most have died due to the current climate and disease. The remaining live near the equator because it resembles their natural habitat. He jumps when he hears Covert Ops Specialist Zora Bennett in the back of his car. She knows Martin is looking for her and wants to know why. He must collect DNA from three distinct dinosaurs to create life-saving heart medication. It's illegal for anyone to travel near the equator. So, this mission is top secret. Zora walks away until Martin offers $10 million. But he must recruit one more person.<br/><br/>Martin and Zora enter the museum while paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis helps box the exhibits. Martin tells Henry his plan, and Henry summarizes that they need Centurian dinosaurs. They need samples from aquatic Mosasaurus, terrestrial Titanosaurus, and avian Quetzalcoatlus. Henry mulls it over, but Zora appeals to his deepest desire: seeing the animals he admires in the wild.<br/><br/>Martin, Zora, and Henry travel to a small island near the equator. Zora sits with Duncan and runs a con on Martin. They get Martin to double his payment so Duncan and his crew can take them to the equator. They set sail from Ile Saint-Hubert to find the creatures. Before they get there, they hear a mayday on the radio. Reuben set sail with his two daughters, Isabella and Teresa, and Teresa's boyfriend, Xavier. A Mosasaurus capsized their vessel, and it's sinking. They save the family and bring them aboard the ship. They believe they are safe until the Mosasaurus attacks them. After a deadly battle, Teresa falls off the vessel while they collect the first sample. Her family and Xavier jump off to save her while Duncan and the remaining team shipwreck on Ile Saint-Hubert. Can both groups survive the island and collect the final two samples?<br/><br/>This film, like the first, lets the viewer's imagination scare them first. Similar to the latest movies, this picture offers new genetically altered dinosaurs. However, the main plot sticks to the classic creatures we love. This script has witty banter, jump scares, and heartfelt moments. The script gets murky with Reuben and his family. It only needs one family member for one critical scene. Otherwise, their subplot is a 30-minute filler. This new installment in the franchise subtly mentions the past films but doesn't rely on them. It's an improvement over the past, but nothing beats the first.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Robert DeShaun Peace sits on the porch and waits for his father, Robert 'Skeet' Douglas, to pick him up. Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

His teacher, Mr. Hill, doesn't teach American History from the textbooks. He encourages his students to be free-thinkers, question authority, and demand change in the Jim Crow South. Mr. Hill sees promise in Elwood and gives Elwood a pamphlet for a free college. Elwood decides to hitchhike to the school and apply. A man pulls over and offers Elwood a ride. Later, police pull the man over. They arrest the man and Elwood for stealing the car. The judge sends Elwood to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school for boys.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Elwood to uncover that the staff treats black and white students differently. He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it. This film is an extraordinary watch if you can handle it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie. He offers to train her the next day.<br/><br/>Mildred arrives at the carnival, and Billy and G. Bill sit outside the ring. To prove her worth, Billy has Mildred face a man. She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Since Ethan did not return the cruciform key in his last mission, the Entity has roamed free on the internet. Without intervention, it will have the world's deadliest forces under its control. The world has two choices. They can become a slave to the Entity or shut down the internet. However, the latter would ensure worldwide chaos. President Sloane gently demands that Ethan turn himself and the key over to her.<br/><br/>With Paris's tip, Ethan and Grace travel to London to find Gabriel. Gabriel gets the drop on them, and they wake up bound. Gabriel admits that the Rabbit's Foot wasn't a biological weapon. It was a device that could give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape and meet with Luther and Benji. Luther hands Ethan a device with malware. If Ethan attaches the device to the Entity's source code, it will infect the Entity, and they can trap it.<br/><br/>Paris takes Ethan to a capsule that Gabriel used to communicate with the Entity. Ethan lets the Entity into his mind, and it discovers a plan of attack. However, Ethan sees the plan too. The Entity plans to escape to the Doomsday Vault in South Africa.<br/><br/>Ethan finally falls in line and turns himself over to the President. However, he urges President Sloane not to arrest him because the Entity knows Ethan is the only one with the power to stop it. She writes a note, seals it, grabs the key, and slips it to the guard. She demands that the guards take Ethan to his cell. The guards take him to an awaiting helicopter and give him the key and the note. Now, Ethan must find the location of the source code, retrieve it, and capture the Entity in South Africa. If not, the Entity will fire the world's nuclear weapons. Can Ethan move in the shadows one more time and save the world?<br/><br/>This eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers a heart-pounding thrill ride with unthinkable missions, setbacks, heartbreak, and breathtaking action. The stunts and graphics are smooth and don't distract from the plot. The film doesn't rely heavily on humor because it focuses on the emotional aspect. It does use a similar setup for two scenes. However, they don't feel redundant. Unlike other films, this picture has three nerve-racking moments running simultaneously. Don't be surprised if you hold your breath. It is one of the best Mission: Impossible films of the series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Elio",
    "review": "Elio hides under the table, mourning the lost of his parents, as his aunt Olga orders food from the Montez Air and Space Museum cafeteria. Olga looks under the table, and Elio is gone. She searches the museum and finds Elio listening to a presentation about the Golden Record. He ponders if there are others out there. It will be a place he could finally fit in.<br/><br/>Elio stakes out places near the Montez Air Force Base to be abducted. One night, Bryce joins Elio on the beach with his hand radio. Bryce asks about the other club members when Bryce's friend, Caleb, joins them. Elio hears a strange signal coming from the radio, and Caleb pulls the radio from Elio's hands, and they fight. The device hits Elio in the eye, and all three boys return to the base.<br/><br/>Major Olga is furious because Elio skipped school and got into a physical altercation. She tells Elio to wait in her office so she can attend a short meeting. A contractor, Gunther Melmac, picked up a signal from outer space. It's the same sound Elio heard from his radio. Melmac believes it's aliens and is ready to send a signal back. Everyone leaves. Elio jumps out of the trash, records a message for aliens to abduct him, and sends it. It shuts down the base.<br/><br/>At her wits' end, Olga takes Elio to a summer academy to curb his behavior. Caleb and Bryce spot Elio's arrival, and Caleb plots his revenge. Caleb, Bryce, and two other boys pull Elio out of his tent. Elio opens his eyes and sees the world around him frozen. He wiggles out of the boys' clutches, and a green beam lifts him off the ground. Elio cheers as he floats to the ship.<br/><br/>Ooooo, a liquid supercomputer, greets Elio and introduces him to the leaders of the Communiverse. Ambassadors Questa, Helix, and Tegmen greet Elio, assuming he's the leader of Earth. They are willing to accept him as a member of the Communiverse but squirm over their second visitor, Lord Grigon. The won't welcome him. Grigon threatens to make them all pay before leaving. They prepare for a fearful retreat and inform Elio that he must return to Earth. Elio can't bear the thought of being alone again and offers a trade. He will broker a deal with Grigon. They agree to let Elio stay if he persuades Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. Will Elio save the Communiverse and find a place where he belongs?<br/><br/>This Pixar film covers acceptance and belonging while honoring a parent's sacrifice and understanding. Emotions aside, this film is visually splendid. The animators didn't use alien stereotypes. They created something new and unique. It's easy to see how this movie can grow and expand into a series on the Disney Channel. While the story will not make you cry, it does connect to the audience. There aren't any sly adult jokes, but this picture is funny. This film is confusing because it lacks a classic villain, leaving the plot more complex. Young viewers will enjoy it, but won't comprehend the message. Overall, Elio is an entertaining but elaborate film for the entire family. It has stellar visuals and a mid-credit scene.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Fantastic Four: First Steps",
    "review": "On Earth-828, the world praises their heroes, dubbing them The Fantastic Four. Four years ago, astronauts Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm went to outer space. A cosmic ray blasted them during their mission, and they gained superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>Today, Sue exits the bathroom and gives her husband, Reed, her positive pregnancy test. They joyously hug and meet Sue's brother, Johnny, and Reed's best friend, Ben, for a dinner prepared by HERBIE. Ben can see the petrified look on Reed's face and deduces that the happy couple will be parents. They celebrate while Reed worries. With their altered DNA, he has no idea what the future will bring for their unborn child.<br/><br/>Over the next few months, Sue negotiates peace talks among all countries and the land of Subterranea. She's preparing for maternity leave when the team receives an alert on their wrist watches. Something has entered the atmosphere. A being on a silver surfboard asks if they are the protectors of the planet. They answer yes. She warns the world that Galactus, Destroyer of Worlds, will arrive on Earth and eat the planet. The Silver Surfer flies away.<br/><br/>The world cheers for the Fantastic Four on Excelsior Launch Day. They locate Galactus just in time to watch him devour a planet. A beam scans their ship but lingers on Sue's stomach. The Silver Surfer enters their spacecraft and invites them to meet Galactus. Galactus says he will spare Earth if they give him their baby. He says the baby hides its true nature from them. Galactus believes the baby will take over his mantle and end his hunger. They refuse, and Galactus uses his powers to make Sue go into labor.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four escapes Galactus's ship, and the Silver Surfer is hot on their trail. They flee to Earth, but not before Sue gives birth to their son, Franklin. They return to a press conference waiting for good news. Sadly, they report that Galactus is coming because they wouldn't give up Franklin. They must find a way to defeat Galactus or lose everything they love. Can the Fantastic Four rescue their family while saving their world?<br/><br/>This film will remind fans why they love superhero movies. The costume and set departments had the ultimate tasks. They had to give the picture a '70s feel while making it futuristic. Their designs expand the imagination and are award-worthy. The script is funny and engaging. Also, Galactus is an old-school villain. He just wants to destroy things. Franklin's CGI isn't perfect, but the team's graphics make up for it. This new adaptation of the iconic superheroes is what fans deserve. The film has a mid- and post-scene. While the mid-credit scene is essential to the future of the MCU, the post-credit scene is for nostalgia.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "F1: The Movie",
    "review": "Sonny finishes his race, collects his meager winnings, and leaves to find the next challenge. He hears a voice behind him and sees a familiar face, Ruben. Ruben and Sonny competed in the past, but now Ruben owns a racing team, APEX GP. However, APEX GP has yet to win a race. If APEX GP doesn't win, the board will remove Ruben. Ruben's best driver, Joshua, is highly skilled but young. Ruben wants Sonny to join his team and bring maturity to it. Ruben believes that Joshua and Sonny could win F1 and bring credibility to APEX GP. So Ruben leaves him a first-class ticket to their training track.<br/><br/>Joshua tries out their new car but notices some issues. Sonny arrives as Joshua reports his findings. Joshua's manager, Cash, pulls him aside. Joshua needs to make a good impression over the next few races. Cash believes APEX GP is going down. If Joshua ranks on the leaderboard, another team could open up a spot for him. Sonny thinks the team can win, but they must make changes to the car. Ruben agrees. While Sonny races to overcome his past, Joshua wants to keep his career. Can APEX GP survive with two men competing for the number one spot?<br/><br/>This film has the high-octane fun of Days of Thunder with witty banter. It pays respect to the intricacies and dangers of racing. The audience sees the split decisions, track sabotage, and teamwork in racing. The film uses F1 drivers and scenarios to increase the drama and urgency. The viewer will feel it in their chest as they get a cockpit view of the track. However, this film isn't solely about the race. It also covers espionage and sabotage, but the writers make the audience connect the clues of who is responsible. While the film is lengthy, it delivers an original competitive racing story.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "M3GAN 2.0",
    "review": "Gemma crusades to reduce children's exposure to technology and AI safeguards after creating a killer robot to help raise her niece, Cady. Gemma hasn't turned her back on technology. She and her team have created an exoskeleton to reduce workplace injuries and increase productivity.<br/><br/>Gemma rushes home after picking Cady up from school. She's late for an investor's meeting. The exoskeleton glitched and hit the investor. Someone hacked them. Then, CEO Alton enters Gemma's home and propositions her. He wants Gemma to work for him and add AI to the human brain. Gemma says no.<br/><br/>Gemma tucks Cady into bed and relaxes for the evening. The lights flicker, and a strange message comes to the TV, telling her to run. Gemma and Cady fight back until one man pulls out a badge. He's with the FBI.<br/><br/>Army Colonel Tim demands answers from Gemma. A few days ago, Tim sent a robot called AMELIA, Autonomous Military Engagement Logistics and Infiltration Android, to rescue a scientist. However, AMELIA killed him, removed her safeguards, and escaped. Since then, AMELIA has killed everyone who had a hand in her creation. He informs Gemma that her M3GAN program was the foundation for AMELIA. He assumes she created the robot and demands an explanation. During the conversation, Gemma checks her phone's notifications. It warns her that Tim is clueless and to ignore his threats. Tim leaves with her phone. She calls out to M3GAN, who appears as a hologram. M3GAN lived in the smart home's system for years, watching them. By M3GAN's calculations, any attempts to stop AMELIA will result in Cady's end. M3GAN wants to protect Cady by stopping AMELIA. But first, she needs Gemma to create a body for her. Gemma will do the one thing she swore she never would: create a better M3GAN. Can they put an end to AMELIA?<br/><br/>This sequel is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The script is funnier, cringier, and more thought-provoking than the first. It allows the audience to think about AI without getting preachy. The graphics department allowed M3GAN to keep her doll-like face while turning her body into the ultimate killing machine. This film is a laugh riot that delivers a few jump scares and a side of Maxwell you have never heard before.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The Bad Guys enjoy life on parole but can't find employment. Mr. Piranha, Ms. Web, and Mr. Shark anxiously wait to hear if Mr. Wolf got work, but they are disappointed. Mr. Snake slithers in to grab his yoga mat. The crew gawks at Mr. Snake's change and doesn't understand how he can be so happy. Mr. Shark thinks they should worry about the Phantom Bandit heists. It's only a matter of time before people blame them for the Phantom's crime spree.<br/><br/>Mr. Wolf spars with Governor Diana Fox. She advises him to win over the town by doing good publicly. Mr. Wolf has an idea and drives to the police station. He and his crew examine the evidence of the heists with Commissioner Misty Luggins. They spot the culprits in the photo and discover that the stolen items contain MacGuffinite.<br/><br/>The team researches and finds that the Lords of Lucha championship title contains the precious metal. They think the Phantom Bandit will strike at the wrestling match. They arrive at the match and spot Mr. Snake with his new girlfriend, Susan. The crew sees the belt hanging over the ring. They deduce that the challenger is the Bandit. They jump into the squared circle and battle for the belt. However, instead of applause, someone frames them for stealing the belt by putting it on Mr. Piranha. Susan hijacks a hotdog cart and saves them. She offers the crew mints, but Mr. Wolf rejects them. Mr. Wolf asks Susan to pull over so he can call Diane and explain that they are innocent. Mr. Wolf returns the van to find the Bad Guys asleep. Susan shoots Mr. Wolf with a dart.<br/><br/>The team wakes up to the Bad Girls. Pig Tails is the muscle. During the match, she hid in plain sight as the challenging luchador. Susan is Doom, a sweet-talker and long-con expert. The mastermind, Kitty Kat, introduces herself. She wants the Bad Guy to help them with their next heists. Mr. Wolf says no. Kitty Kat threatens to expose Diane's secret life as the Crimson Paw if he doesn't assist. Mr. Wolf agrees, but he assures his crew that he has an ace up his sleeve. Can the Bad Guys do good and protect Diane's reputation?<br/><br/>This sequel is better than the first. The capers are more outlandish, the jokes are funnier, and the plot delves deeper. This story handles reform and redemption. The animation jumps genres throughout the fight scenes. Typically, this feels disjointed. It works because the graphic artist continued this change throughout the entire film. It makes the art feel more alive and enveloping. Be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene. It gives insight into the plot for The Bad Guys 3. This picture has the crime style of Leverage, the smoothness of Ocean's Eleven, and the fun of The Fast and the Furious. The entire family will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Talent manager Anna bangs on her daughter's door before school. However, Harper won't open the door. Anna's mother, Tess, calls to offer Harper a ride to school. Anna wants to give Harper a ride and tells Tess to relax. Therapist Tess hangs up, finishes her podcast, and kisses her husband, Ryan, goodbye. Finally, Anna opens the door and finds Harper's note. Harper started her morning with surfing.<br/><br/>In the car, Harper groans about her chemistry partner, Lily. Harper thinks Lily is obnoxious. Tess and Anna advise Harper to keep an open mind before dropping Harper off at school. That treaty is non-existent. Lily and Harper argue during chemistry class, causing a foam explosion. The principal calls Anna and Lily's dad, Chef Eric, into school. They run into each other in the halls and fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged.<br/><br/>Lily and Harper disagree during a school bake sale, triggering a school-wide food fight. The tension in the home is rising between Harper and Lily. Anna tells them that they will attend her bachelorette party and get along.<br/><br/>At the bachelorette party, a multi-hyphenate psychic, Madame Jen, offers to give Anna and Tess a reading. Lily and Harper argue in the corner, and Madame Jen interrupts them. Madame Jen tells them, 'Change the hearts you know are wrong, so that you may find where you belong.' Harper thinks she belongs in LA and Lily London. The four feel an earthquake. Tess and Anna try to ignore it.<br/><br/>Harper, Tess, Lily, and Anna return to Tess's home. They make Lily and Harper sleep in the living room to force them to be friendly. They sleep through the night. When Harper wakes up, her face and hands feel dry. Tess hears her daughter's yell and wakes on the couch. She notices her bones feel better. She's in Lily's body. Tess and Lily switched, like Anna and Harper. They ask Harper and Lily if Madame June said anything to break the curse. They lie and say no. Lily and Harper will use the swap to break up their parents' wedding. A wedding that happens in a few days. Can they swap back before the wedding, if there is a wedding?<br/><br/>Sound the alarm! This sequel respects the original while being a multigenerational, heartfelt, funny film. Like the first movie, the script features a wedding on the line, with a new husband, but changes by adding a relocation and Lily's deceased mother. For the die-hard fans, everyone returns. The Pink Slips, Harry, and Mama P make a satisfying comeback for the fans. The writers hide easter eggs with the soundtrack, decor, jokes, and food. Freakier Friday is a comedy with great timing and physicality. It celebrates complicated family dynamics without muting anyone's perspectives or feelings. You will leave this movie as you did the first, feeling seen and seeing. This film is a sequel that's worth seeing in theaters and is worth the wait.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
