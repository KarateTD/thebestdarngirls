    "review": "A human-made virus increased apes' intelligence and gave them the ability to speak, but it did the opposite for humans. One of the apes led them to prosperity. His name was Caesar, but he died many generations ago. Today, the Eagle Clan is a close-knit group that will celebrate the bonding ceremony at sunrise. Noa, urged by his mother, runs to his father, Koro, with his eagle egg. Koro is proud but smells a unique scent on Noa's blanket. Noa admits an Echo - their name for a human - took his blanket, but Noa retrieved it. Koro demands to know if Noa went into the valley. Noa truthfully says no.<br/><br/>Noa catches an odor coming from a tent and investigates. He finds a female Echo hiding inside and scares it away. The Echo charges past him and breaks his egg. He needs it for the ceremony. So, he travels into the forest to get a new one. He hears the Coastal Clan riding on their horses and hides. They see Noa's horse in the woods, shock it, and follow it to the Eagle Clan.<br/><br/>Noa hurries home to warn the others, but it's too late. Proximus, leader of the Coastal Clan, had his army attack the Eagle clan and take them prisoner. Noa wakes up in the morning. The Coastal Clan killed Koro and stole the Eagle Clan. Noa travels through the valley and vows to bring them back. Noa will learn the truth about Caesar, the Echos, and Proximus's greatest desire. Proximus is hunting the female Echo because she is the key to the evolution of his Kingdom of Apes.<br/><br/>This latest Planet of the Apes installment has mesmerizing graphics, heart-warming laughs, and a captivating storyline. The plot slows when Noa uncovers Promxius's plan and meets Raka. Don't get confused. This film occurs several generations after Caesar died. One thing Apes and Humans want is knowledge. It's the key to their survival, but can they coexist? This plot point is the movie's standout. Planet fans should keep their eyes and ears open for a few easter eggs. And there aren't any post-credit scenes, but the movie leaves room for another film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "IF",
    "review": "Elizabeth, better known as Bea, temporarily moves in with her grandmother during her father's treatment. For Bea, this brings back memories of when she lost her mother. Her mother encouraged her to tell stories, perform, and play make-believe. Her dad does the same with his joyful attitude.<br/><br/>After visiting her dad, Bea sees a young girl running in the hallway. Bea chases after her, but the girl runs into the top-floor apartment. Bea knocks, and a man answers without opening the door. The man answers that no girl lives there.<br/><br/>Bea finds an old camcorder and plays the tape inside. It's a recording of happier times with her mother. Then she sees the man and girl outside her window. Bea follows them down the street and watches the man enter a brownstone. Inside the home, the man, Cal, asks Blue to come out of the closet. Outside, Bea sees Blue's large purple hand open the bedroom window. She turns in disbelief and sees the girl from the apartment. But she is not human. Bea faints.<br/><br/>Bea wakes up in Cal's apartment, and the 'girl,' Blossom, makes Bea tea. Blue explains that they are IF, an acronym for Imaginary Friend. The kids that manifested them grew up. Cal is a matchmaker of sorts. He is helping them find new kids to match with. Bea gets an idea. They will locate the kids who created them as adults now. If they can get the adults to remember them, maybe they'll save the IFs. Bea, who tries to be an adult, will discover the beauty in fun and imagination.<br/><br/>This film is an astounding, heartfelt story that asks, 'What IF.' Viewers must catch this movie from the beginning. The script delivers the lovely relationship between Bea and her parents in a montage. Seeing the IFs helps Bea find joy in having fun again. The script shows the audience the importance of Imaginary Friends then and now. And the score will make your heart swell with excitement. You will want the DVD to uncover what they left on the cutting room floor. If you saw this movie, don't ruin the twist. But adults may see it coming.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga",
    "review": "Furiosa plucks fruit with her sister, Valkyrie, when she sees scavengers in their woods. Furiosa's home is an oasis, The Green Place, in the wastelands, and she has to protect it. One of the scavengers captures and kidnaps Furiosa. Valkyrie warns their mother, Mary. Mary finds Furiosa but gets captured by Dementus, the biker leader. Dementus sees Furiosa is in good health and demands to know her origin. Both refuse to talk. So Dementus makes Furiosa watch as he kills her mother.<br/><br/>Dementus sees his men are starving and orders Immortan Joe, ruler of the Citadel, to give his people more food and water. When Joe doesn't listen, Dementus captures the ruler of Gastown and brings him to the Citadel. Joe gives in to some of Dementus's requests and makes Dementus the new ruler of Gastown. However, Joe wants Furiosa as a future wife because she has never been sick. Furiosa must escape Joe, get revenge for Mary, and return to The Green Place.<br/><br/>This prequel has the action you expect from the Mad Max series while answering fanatics' questions about Furiosa. This installment tells you who kidnapped her, what happened to her arm, the start of her face paint, and how she developed into a War Rig commander and Imperator. Also, this movie, unlike its predecessor, is told in four parts - The Pole Inaccessibility, Lessons from the Wasteland, The Stowaway, and Homeward. And the director brilliantly connected the two movies for die-hard fans in the last scene. When there isn't an explosion to rely on, the dialogue and storytelling dulls.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

She feels that the Vatican ignores the East. So, Mother Cabrini wants to begin in China and work her way West. She wants to create an Empire of Hope. She refuses the cardinal's rejection and demands to speak to the Pope. The Pope listens to Mother Cabrini's passionate plea and accepts her mission but with a condition. Italian immigrants living in New York's Five Points witness children freezing to death in the streets while Americans ignore their plight. The Pope will allow Mother Cabrini's mission if she starts in New York. Mother Cabrini returns and tells her fellow Sisters to pack. They migrate to New York. Cabrini, sick with lung disease, will face prejudice, corruption, and sexism to save children around the world.<br/><br/>This nun doesn't sit idly by and accept rejection. She learns to navigate the world of politics and media to sway the opinions of the American people. She gains allies from all walks of life to advance her efforts. Mother Cabrini's drive comes from a short life expectancy. She doesn't have time to accept no. This woman wasn't afraid to be loud, towering, and visible.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Marcus gets help from Captain Conrad's daughter, U.S. Marshall Judy, and granddaughter, Callie. Marcus dances the Wobble and suffers a heart attack. Captain Conrad assures Marcus that he won't die and gives Marcus a warning. Marcus wakes up with a new lease on life and is 100% fearless. As Marcus begs Mike to get him Skittles, Mike gets a news alert on his phone. The FBI found evidence that Captain Conrad was working with the drug cartels.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus run to headquarters to clear their captain's legacy, but Captain Rita and her boyfriend, Attorney General Lockwood, must follow the evidence. Judy enters and demands they find the real culprits. Mike offers to help, but she refuses because Mike's son, Armando, killed her dad.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus ride and contemplate their next steps when they get a video message from Conrad. He was looking into corruption after their ecstasy bust years ago. Now, he needs his Bad Boys to clear his name. He warns them to trust no one. Mike believes they must ask a cartel member to catch the corruption.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus visit Armando in prison. Armando states that Conrad was clean. Also, his mother, Isabel, didn't put Conrad on the list; someone added him. Mike and Marcus find Conrad's secret case files and pull Armando out of jail to go through them. They believe they have an advantage, but the culprit is one step ahead. To get through this, Mike and Marcus will need fate, AMMO, Reggie, and alligators.<br/><br/>For newcomers to the franchise, it helps to see the three previous films before watching this 4th installment. This chapter of the buddy-action-comedy will introduce a new version of Bad Boys, tie up loose ends, and show you another side of Reggie. Unlike the previous films, Mike is cautious and has panic attacks. However, Marcus is fearless and wild. Their switch, along with the action-packed fight scenes, make this movie entertaining. Be prepared to laugh, wince, and cheer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Over the years, Riley became an excellent student, strong hockey player, animal lover, and caring friend. Her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - continue to share her core memories and store them in long-term storage. The vital memories form her beliefs. Each belief creates Riley's belief system and her sense of self, the newest section of her mind. Joy will do anything to protect the latest system.<br/><br/>Riley celebrates with her best friends Grace and Bree as the coach of the Fire Hawks, Coach Roberts, approaches them after winning a game. She wants them to come to her hockey camp to train. Her favorite player, Val, is on the team. Val started her first year and is a legend among high school players. Grace, Bree, and Riley accept the invitation.<br/><br/>Riley goes to bed the night before camp and dreams of meeting Val and practicing with her friends. As Riley turns in for the night, her emotions do the same. A beeping awakes Joy in the middle of the night. She and the other emotions walk over to the console and see the puberty light gently flashing. Then, it blares. The demo team rips out the console and updates it for the new guys, but Riley wakes up before they finish.<br/><br/>Riley's mother, Mrs. Andersen, enters Riley's room and expresses her surprise that Riley isn't ready for camp. Her emotions touch the console, and Riley cries, yells, and collapses in bed. They find a new emotion touching it. Anxiety introduces Riley's emotions to Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment.<br/><br/>The Andersens give Riley and her friends a ride to camp. Riley talks about their future together when Disgust notices a look on Bree's face. Grace feels the tension and blurts out that she and Bree will attend a different high school. Riley maintains her composure until her parents drive away. Val notices Riley's sadness, talks to her, and invites Riley to sit with her team. Anxiety takes over and defuses the situation by predicting possible outcomes and changes Riley's personality to give Riley the best conclusion. Joy tries to help, but her attempts make Riley look silly. Anxiety tells Embarrassment to grab Riley's old emotions after Joy makes another mistake. Anxiety tells the mind police to take them to Riley's Dark Secrets Vault. Then, Anxiety disconnects Riley's Sense of Self and sends it to the back of Riley's mind. They will use her new memories with second-generation emotions to build a new Riley. Can Riley's first-generation emotions return to Riley's mind before Anxiety takes over?<br/><br/>Riley and her emotions did it again. They cause the audience to laugh, cringe, cry, and breathe a sigh of relief. The writers added new sections of Riley's mind while taking fans through familiar territory. Riley breaks the rules, disregards her friends, and forces herself to practice when her other emotions are at the helm. Riley loses her Sense of Self for popularity. The movie explains how Anxiety works, helps, and harms people in a lovingly gentle way. The conclusion profoundly affects adults and teaches kids the value of emotions. You should see this movie in theaters today.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

They have two children, Ladonna and Princeton. However, Donna's mother, Murtha, wants Donna and W.C. to have more children. Murtha, the mother of 18, returns home and dies. Donna falls into a depression for months. After arguing with W.C., Donna leaves the house and travels to the ruins of her childhood home. There, she sees a group of children playing and hears God speak to her. Donna calls her sister, Diann, and asks Diann to attend an adoption seminar.<br/><br/>Social worker Susan explains that 70% of the children suffer from poverty-induced neglect. The other 30% suffered severe abuse. She shows Diann and Donna images of the other 30%, and the pictures call both to act.<br/><br/>A brother and sister come to Susan's office with heartbreaking stories. Susan exhausts all her options. Donna jumps at the chance to help and welcomes them into her home. W.C. preaches to their congregation about their adoption, the excuses not to adopt, and the bible's most notable adoption. It inspires 22 families to adopt. However, the people can't afford to come to Susan for the classes. They ask Susan to host it in their church. This small town will make a lasting imprint on the children, Texas, and the system, but it won't be easy.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't make adoption look effortless. However, the families in Possum Trot never give up. The writers don't depict adoption as a magic bullet to fix these children's long-term hardships. It's the first step of many. When W.C. and Donna see the town falling apart and second-guessing their choice, they lean on each other with group prayer and outreach. They recap the children and townspeople today at the conclusion before asking the audience to help. It will assist viewers make an informed choice about adoption. But hopefully, it will spark a passion for others to follow Possum Trot's lead.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadpool and Wolverine",
    "review": "Wade Wilson wanted more from his life because Vanessa asked him to cut out the nonsense. He uses Cable's time-traveling device to join a superhero team, but they reject him. Wade returns to his timeline and sells cars with Peter for 6 years. Deadpool is a thing of the past. Wade bikes home and finds a surprise birthday party waiting for him. He answers a knock at the door and assumes the uniformed people are strippers. They are the Time Variant Authority or TVA. They rip the wig off Wade's head and pull him into a portal.<br/><br/>Wade wakes up at a table with Mr. Paradox at the opposite end. Mr. Paradox introduces Wade to the TVA and the Sacred Timeline. Mr. Paradox warns Wade that his timeline will end because an 'anchor being' died. He grows tired of waiting for the timelines to parish. Mr. Paradox is building a Time Ripper to destroy Wade's timeline but will allow Wade to move to another and spare his life. Wade assumes he's the anchor being, and Mr. Paradox laughs. Wade's timeline's anchor is Wolverine. Wade can't stomach the thought of losing his friends. He steals Mr. Paradox's TemPad and jumps through timelines to find a replacement Wolverine.<br/><br/>Wade returns with a suitable Logan and demands Mr. Paradox return them to his timeline. Mr. Paradox laughs because this version of Logan ended his universe. Mr. Paradox sends them to the Void. He expects Cassandra Nova and Alioth to finish the job. Wade and Logan must put their issues aside to leave the Void, stop Mr. Paradox from using the Time Ripper, and save Wade's timeline.<br/><br/>This movie reaches across universes and production studios to fulfill every fan's fantasy. The opening sequence starts with blood, guts, violation, and NSync. Then, Wade travels through the timeline and finds a host of Wolverines. They will surprise and humor you. The team-up in the Void is legendary and finishes several characters' stories while staying true to Deadpool. The graphics hold hidden gems amongst the gore and make your stomach churn with Cassandra's powers. The music covers all genres and is perfectly inappropriate. This film will surpass your expectations and remind you why you love this franchise. See this before anyone spoils the surprises. Also, there are post- and mid-credit scenes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trap",
    "review": "Cooper smiles as his daughter, Riley, dances and sings to her favorite artist, Lady Raven. As they wait in line to scan their tickets, Cooper notices officers with high-powered rifles.<br/><br/>They settle into their seats as Lady Raven performs for 20,000 people. Cooper spots police officers taking men out of the audience. Cooper enters the bathroom stall, pulls out his phone, and checks on Spencer. Spencer is the person Cooper chained in a basement. Cooper gleams as Spencer pulls his chains, cries, and begs for help.<br/><br/>During the intermission, Riley wants concert merchandise. The vendor, Jamie, loves Cooper's example. He offers to find another shirt later if Cooper returns in 10 minutes. Cooper pulls Jamie aside and asks why the arena has a vast police presence. Jamie whispers that the concert is a trap. The FBI discovered that 'The Butcher' would be there. The Butcher is a notorious serial killer who dismembered a dozen victims. They have SWAT covering every exit, FBI profiler Dr. Josephine Grant in The Butcher's head, and they will stop every man.<br/><br/>Cooper tests the security. He sees a drunken girl wobbling near a staircase. He bumps into her, and she falls. Arena security runs to her aid, but SWAT doesn't move. Cooper has to find a way out of the trap without tipping off Riley. Can he make it out?<br/><br/>This movie builds slowly for 15 minutes to allow the audience to see Cooper's bond with Riley and Riley's admiration for Lady Raven. Viewers will notice little quirks in Cooper's character before he sits with his daughter. It's not until Cooper looks at his phone that you understand the depths of his depravity. Cooper maneuvers around the arena with precision, finesse, and dumb luck. With this director, you expect a twist. However, there are several that will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you root for Cooper.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Rob Peace",
    "review": "Robert DeShaun Peace sits on the porch and waits for his father, Robert 'Skeet' Douglas, to pick him up. Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
