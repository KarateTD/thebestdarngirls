    "review":"Evelyn prepares the paperwork for their upcoming audit.  Her focus pulls her attention away from her husband, Waymond, when he tries to hand her divorce papers.  Her daughter, Joy, waits for Evelyn with Joy's girlfriend, Becky.  Evelyn brushes off Joy and concentrates on work.<br/><br/>Evelyn grabs her paperwork and goes to the IRS headquarters with Waymond and her father, Gong Gong.  As they ride the elevator up, Waymond deploys an umbrella to block the camera, grabs two earbuds, and puts them in Evelyn's ears.  He tells Evelyn that he is Waymond from another universe, and he needs her help.  If she wants to see him again, follow the instructions on the paper.<br/><br/>While talking with the IRS inspector, Deirdre, Evelyn looks at the paper.  It gives Evelyn 3 steps that land her in the janitor's closet with the other Waymond.  He tells her that the multiverse exists.  When another Evelyn discovered you could connect to another version of yourself, they used the power to gain skills.  But Jobu Tupaki wants to use this ability to destroy all the universes.  So, she is going through each one and killing Evelyns.  Waymond wants this universe's Evelyn to tap into the other Evelyns and defeat Jobu.  Then, Waymond and Deidre start fighting.  Within minutes, Evelyn has to learn how to tap into the multiverse, use her powers, and fight Jobu.  When she is face-to-face with her universe's Jobu, can Evelyn kill Jobu?<br/><br/>This film mixes the lessons of generational pain with some of the most hilarious, painful, and outrageous fight scenes ever crafted.  To tap into another universe's skills, they have to stimulate themselves. And it gets wild with fanny packs, awards, and dogs.  This 3-part film slows down towards the end and loses the audience for a while.  Be ready for a visual feast.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Bad Guys",
    "review":"Mr. Wolf is the mastermind behind a gang of thieves.  Mr. Snake is the safe-cracker of the crew with no fingers.  Ms. Tarantula is the hacker, and everyone calls her Web.  Mr. Shark is a master of disguise.  Mr. Piranha is the craziest member because he is willing to fight no matter how many people stand in his way.  Since the world sees them as bad, they act accordingly by robbing banks, pick-pocketing, and running long cons.  Mr. Wolf watches the news coverage, and Governor Foxington's comments make him angry.  Governor Foxington feels sorry for them because they are playing into a stereotype, and she knows the police will catch them soon.  Mr. Wolf wants revenge and decides to loot the Good Samaritan Award, The Golden Dolphin.  The legendary Crimson Paw came close to stealing it but went into hiding afterward.  Mr. Wolf convinces Mr. Snake to take the job by showing him the recipient: Professor Marmalade, a guinea pig.  Mr. Snake can't resist because guinea pigs are his favorite food.<br/><br/>After a wild, well-executed, stinky heist, the team is ready to walk away scot-free.  Then, Mr. Wolf sees an old lady going down the stairs with an open purse full of money and jewels.  He tries to take it, but she starts to fall down the stairs.  He decides to pull her back and help her.  She pats Mr. Wolf on the hand and calls him a good boy.  It has an instant effect on him.  After exposure, Chief Misty arrests the bad guys and throws them in the police van.  Prof. Marmalade speaks on behalf of The Bad Guys.  He offers to reform them at his private residence instead of jail time.  Mr. Wolf agrees on behalf of the entire crew.<br/><br/>Inside the police van, Mr. Wolf's agreement confuses the crew.  They want to know why Mr. Wolf agreed to go 'good.'  Mr. Wolf explains that the award will be at Prof. Marmalade's home.  If they get inside, they will have a second chance to take it.  The Bad Guys will become The Good Guys to be The Bad Guys.<br/><br/>Based on The Bad Guys by Aaron Blabey, this animated Leverage with Logan Lucky comedy style will have adults and kids laughing.  The basis of the heist is realistic, but for children, the animation adds a lot of fun and creative dramatics.  Without it, you can remove the cartoon, add real people, and the script would work.  Adults may want to watch it twice with all the added plot twists.  Yes, there are several within the con.  This movie teaches kids to be more than a stereotype.  That's a lesson everyone can learn.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Veteran William Sharp sits on the phone arguing with insurance companies.  His wife, Amy, needs experimental surgery to save her life.  William hangs up the phone and tells Amy everything will be ok.  Then, he reminds her to turn on the alarm while he goes on a forklift driver interview.  Unbeknownst to Amy, William drives to Danny's chopshop.<br/><br/>As William attempts to ask for a 231,000 dollar loan, Danny collects his crew and cars for his next heist.  He gives William 5 minutes to decide if he is in or out.  If William joins, he will gain millions.  William gears up and jumps on the truck.  But there is a kink in the plan.  Officer Zack built up the nerve to talk to his bank teller crush, Kim.  Seeing Zack won't let up, Danny lets Zack inside.  Soon, Zack realizes something is going on, and all hell breaks loose.  Danny didn't know he was part of a task force sting operation.  They knew Danny wanted to hit a bank and planned to catch him after the robbery without hostages.  But Zack messed up their plan too.<br/><br/>After a fight in the parking garage, William shoots Zack.  They see EMT Cam and Scott loading Zack onto the ambulance.  William pulls Scott from the driver's seat, and Danny tries to force Cam out of the back.  But she will not leave her patient.  Danny agrees because killing a cop is a life sentence.  Also, Danny can use Cam and Zack as bargaining chips with the police.  With millions in their bag and two hostages, can Danny and William get home with the money?<br/><br/>A remake of Ambulancen, this film gives you a brief introduction to William's turmoil.  Then the action gets going.  The synopsis above is the first 20 minutes of the movie.  The tale of family bonds rivals all other films before it.  With a 60-mph surgery, unholy alliances, and sharpshooters, this film allows the audience to care about Cam, Danny, and William.  Watch this movie on the big screen only.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Father Stu",
    "review":"Stuart Long is an amateur boxer looking for his big break, but he is in the hospital again.  The doctor tells Stu to quit boxing.  Wallowing in self-pity, Stu goes to his brother's grave and drinks.  The cops pull him over and arrest him.  When his mother, Kathleen, bails Stu out of jail, he has a new goal: go to Hollywood and become an actor.<br/><br/>Stu arrives in Hollywood with dreams of becoming famous.  He works in a butcher's shop at the back of a convenience store until then.  At work, Stu sees a beautiful woman, Carmen, and tries to ask her out.  She turns him down and walks out of the store.  A co-worker tells Stu that Carmen posted a flyer for a local church.  Stu gets dressed up and goes to church to impress her.<br/><br/>After a tumultuous day with his father, Bill, Stu rides his motorcycle down the street.  A car almost side-swipes him.  While dodging out of the way, Stu runs a red light.  He gets hit by a car, falls into the street, and gets run over by another vehicle.  As he lays there dying, Stu has a vision of Mary.  She tells him he has more in store for his life, and he will inspire others.  After a few surgeries, Stu feels back to his old self.  He calls Carmen on a date. She thinks Stu is going to propose.  Instead, Stu tells her he wants to become a priest.  Stu plans to enter theology school, become a priest, and lead a flock.  As they say, 'If you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans.' Stu will inspire others in a way he could never imagine.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie is about redemption and grace.  Don't expect the wholesome story that viewers get this time of the year.  This film doesn't try to sugarcoat Stu's life or actions.  He, like everyone else, is a flawed man that struggles each day.  The burden of being a living failure weighs heavily on Stu's soul.  But each downfall becomes a triumph and helps him point his flock onto the right path.  See this one, but not with the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Doctor Strange and America Chavez run towards the Book of Vishanti with a demon chasing them.  Doctor Strange realizes the demon is too strong to stop.  There is only one way to win and save the multiverse, kill America.  Then, he wakes up in bed.  Doctor Strange is accustomed to these nightmares and brushes them off.  Today, Christine will marry Charles.<br/><br/>At the reception, Dr. Strange hears car crashes and people screaming.  He looks outside to see cars slamming by themselves.  He uses a spell to reveal a monster chasing a girl.  After Doctor Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong save the girl, Doctor Strange remembers her from his dream.  America swipes his sling ring and runs away.  Strange and Wong catch up to her, get the sling ring, and ask why the monster came after her.  She explains a demon desires to steal her power because she has the ability to jump through universes. Doctor Strange's dreams weren't dreams.  However, they were connections to the other Doctor Stranges in different universes.  Wong remembers markings on the monster, but they didn't look like any ruins they know.  They looked like witchcraft.  Doctor Strange decides to consult the strongest witch he knows: Wanda.<br/><br/>As Strange discusses the multiverse with Wanda, she says America's name.  Strange freezes because he never said it.  Wanda sent the creatures after America.  Wanda acquired the Darkhold and used it to move between universes to steal America's powers.  Once she has America's abilities, she can be in another universe with Billy and Tommy forever.  She gives Doctor Strange until sundown to bring America to her, or Scarlet Witch will come for them.<br/><br/>This movie kicks down any preconceived notions about the movie or the multiverse.  Before watching this film, you should watch What If, WandaVision, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange.  While you won't get that awe-inspiring, stand up and cheer moment fans get with the other movies, you have a good time. You should know this is one of the most ruthless and bloody films in the MCU.  The graphics are stunning and look better in 3D.  And there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Gorr asks his God why he didn't assist him and his daughter. His God admits he didn't care and can find new followers. Gorr renounces his God and then summons the killer's weapon, Necrosword, to him and slays the God. He vows to become the new God Killer and murder every God and their followers.<br/><br/>After defeating Thanos and his army, Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to defend the universe. The battles are simple for this God of Thunder. After Thor finishes another battle leaving the Guardians useless, they looked for more distressed planets. And Thor spots Sif. Thor and Korg go to Sif and find her injured on the battlefield. She warns Thor that Asgard is Gorr's next stop. Thor, Korg, and Sif head to Asgard.<br/><br/>Dr. Jane Foster wrote a book and is a leader in her field, but she spends more time researching her stage 4 cancer than the stars. Then, Jane hears Mjolnir calling her name. She travels to Asgard, a vacation destination, and searches for the shattered pieces of Mjolnir. In Asgard, King Valkyrie spends more time on politics than battle.<br/><br/>Thor, Korg, and Sif return to Asgard and discover it under attack. Gorr summoned shadow monsters to attack the Asgardians. Thor grabs Stormbreaker for battle but sees a familiar object ripping through creatures. It's Mjolnir. Thor calls the hammer towards him, but it's under the control of someone else: Jane, The Mighty Thor. However, they don't notice other shadow monsters stealing the Asgard children until it's too late.<br/><br/>As Valkyrie, Jane, and Thor create a plan to rescue the kids, Axl, Heimdall's son, connects to Thor using his inherited gifts. Through Axl's eyes, Thor can see the children inside a Shadow Realm cave. Valkyrie and Thor exchange a look. They know the best place to summon a God's army is Omnipotent City and then asking Zeus. They can rescue the Asgardian children and defeat Gorr with Zeus's army. Thor doesn't understand that fighting a war is easy, but battling for love will kill.<br/><br/>During the opening credits, viewers get a glimpse into the battles of the Asgardians of the Galaxy. This film adds insight into the past while giving hints to the overarching antagonist of these MCU phases. So keep your eyes open. Let's not forget that the script introduces us to more Young Avengers. The movie is off-the-charts with well-crafted CGI and flawless fight choreography. During the Shadow Realm fight scene, the contrast of the black and white world with the color from the clashing weapons is worth the 3D price. Unlike other Thor movies, this film gives the characters a satisfying and heart-warming conclusion. And stick around for two post-credit scenes that offer a new villain and a new life.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
