    "mtitle":"Cocaine Bear",
    "review":"Andrew C. Thorton the second drops bags of cocaine from a plane onto the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in 1985. Andrew straps the final duffle to his harness and prepares to jump out of the plane. However, Andrew knocks himself unconscious on the airplane's door and dies. Knoxville resident, Fred Myers, finds Andrew's body and alerts the police. Detective Bob discovers Andrew works for Missouri dealer Syd and summarizes there are more drugs around the area.<br/><br/>Syd calls Daveed to the local restaurant. Syd wants Daveed to find his missing cocaine and take his son, Eddie, with him. And Syd must get the drugs back before the Columbians start asking questions. Daveed locates Eddie at a bar and convinces him to come to the forest to find the cocaine.<br/><br/>Sari informs her daughter, Dee Dee, that they won't paint the falls this weekend. Once Sari leaves, Dee Dee's friend, Henry, comes to the house. Dee Dee has a new plan. They will skip school and go to the forest so she can paint the falls without Sari. The school calls Sari, and she returns home and finds Henry's backpack. Inside, Sari finds a map of the falls and heads to the forest after them.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to anyone, a black bear found several kilos of drugs and ate them. Now, an apex predator is high on cocaine, and Dee Dee, Henry, Sari, Eddie, Daveed, and Bob are all headed in its direction. This doped bear will leave a trail of blood, guts, bones, and drool that no one will forget.<br/><br/>Viewers must prepare to laugh from beginning to end with amusing jump scares. While the plot is nothing like the real story, it uses the legend as its premise. Parents should understand this film is not for young kids. The editor added real news clips to the movie to bring you back to the period with the 'Say No To Drugs' and 'This is Your Brain On Drugs' campaigns. It also includes the report of Fred finding the body. Of course, the bear isn't flawless CGI, but that helps viewers see the movie as a comedy instead of pure horror. See this movie in theaters if you need a good laugh with your jump scare. And it has two post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gemma created the latest toy craze, PurrPetual Pets. But her boss, David, wants her to make a new model at a lower price. Instead of working on the updated Pet, Gemma and her team, Tess and Cole, keep working on the Model 3 Generative Android, M3gan, for short. Gemma tries a simple demo, but the doll's face melts. David leaves the room enraged and demands Gemma scrap M3gan and begin working on a cheaper Pet. Then Gemma gets a phone call from the hospital in Oregon. Her sister, Ava, and brother-in-law, Ryan, died in a car accident, but their daughter, Cady, survived.<br/><br/>Gemma moves Cady into her home but doesn't have toys, books, or a dedicated space for Cady. Cady comes into Gemma's workshop and shows Gemma her drawings. So, Gemma shows Cady a robot she made in college, Bruce. It's a motion caption robot using gloves to interact. Cady comments that it's a cool toy and the only one she would ever need. Gemma, Tess, and Cole work overtime to fix M3gan.<br/><br/>They invite David to a private meeting and have him watch M3gan interact with Cady. David loves M3gan and wants to present it to the board immediately. Gemma thinks the bond will help Cady recover after losing her parents, allow her to work, and put her company at number one. She wants Cady to be happy, the same as M3gan. Only M3gan will kill for it because Gemma forgot rule number one of toy designing: parental controls.<br/><br/>While Chucky starts creepy, M3gan is a lifesize Barbie on steroids. In true Blumhouse fashion, this script is funny, scary, and twisted. And it sets itself apart from other AI and doll movies because it discusses attachment theory. Cady becomes frighteningly dependent on M3gan and physically attacks Gemma when she can't have M3gan. While we are nowhere near this level of AI, Cady's misplaced attachment is the real threat in society today. Audiences will cringe, laugh, and OMG as M3gan takes over. This film is definitely worth a watch and discussion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Otto scoffs at the Dyn and Merika signs for the new condos. The realtors are trying to entice Otto and his neighbors to sell, but they remain firm.<br/><br/>After Otto's neighborhood checks, he helps his new neighbor, Marisol, and her husband, Tommy, and their two daughters parallel park their moving trailer. Otto cancels his utilities, anchors a rope to the ceiling, and hangs himself. Otto sees visions of his late wife, Sonya, as he slips away, but the metal ring breaks before he dies. Otto isn't happy to be alive. Instead, he is upset that you can't find decent material these days. Otto doesn't see the point of living without Sonya, and Otto will try again to end it. However, the neighborhood he pushed away will unknowingly come to his rescue, and he theirs.<br/><br/>Based on A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman and a remake of A Man Called Ove, this movie weaves humor and sadness expertly. Otto is a grumpy, older man screaming at the changing of the times in the beginning. However, you get to know his story during each attempt. Otto's cantankerous behavior is valid, although misdirected. If you cried at the beginning of Up, be prepared to have your tissues ready. This film will stay with you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"It's been ten years since the Na'vi kicked humans off Omaticaya, but a few stayed. Dr. Norm and Dr. Max remained because they sided with the Na'vi and continued their studies. The humans left Spider behind because he was too young to go into cryostasis. He is the son of Colonel Miles and loves to be in the Pandora rainforest with Jake and his family instead of other humans. Jake and Neytiri have four children, Neteyam, Kiri, Lo'ak, and Tuk.<br/><br/>During date night, Jake and Neytiri notice an extra star in the sky. The humans are back. They create a massive fireball to destroy several habitats. However, Jake prepared the Na'vi, and they are battle ready. Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak go to Jake and Miles's last battle site. They find Na'vi in full camouflage and guns. The humans cloned Na'vi bodies and implanted a person's personality and memories in the bodies. Now, Colonel Miles is a walking Na'vi Trojan horse.<br/><br/>After a standoff between Jake and Miles, Miles takes Spider, and Jake runs with his kids. Staying will bring more devastation to her people, so they must leave their life behind. Jake and his family travel to the water and meet with Tonowari. He leads the reef people of Metkayina with his wife, Ronal, by his side. Jake and his family must learn the way of the water to survive on the reef. And they need to study it quickly. Cloning Na'vi isn't the only thing humans desire. However, Miles's need for revenge is his driving force to hunt Jake and his entire family with a captive Spider assisting.<br/><br/>The sequel to Avatar expands the cinematic world by introducing the reef people. Viewers get new animals, plant life, and customs in this new environment. This movie has a lengthy running time, but it doesn't feel 3 hours long. The audience is so immersed in the scenes and culture that you don't mind. The animators did a magnificent job blending real people with motion-capture characters. The moment Tonowari and Ronal discuss Jake and his family staying is the best-animated scene, and it had zero words. Tonowari and Ronal give each other stern looks, loving eyes, and a plea. You will laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer throughout the movie. This film goes beyond what fans expect and is worth the 13-year wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

He and their parents believe the soldiers are heroes protecting the country from communism. However, Christine believes President LBJ is lying to the American people.<br/><br/>At the bar, the owner, Colonel, says he wishes he could give the Inwood guys in Vietnam a beer to show his support and lift their spirits.

    "review":"Sonny Vaccaro looks through game tapes to find the next athletic sponsor for Nike. The CEO, Phil Knight, authorized $250,000 for three players. Sonny has plenty on his shoulders because Nike's basketball division is floundering. Sonny sits in a marketing meeting with its head, Rob Strasser, and looks through the 1984 NBA draft picks. Sonny wants them to consider Michael Jordan, but the staff knows Jordan is expensive and prefers Adidas. Sonny leaves the meeting upset and looks over more college basketball tapes. While watching, he sees an Arthur Ashe commercial for tennis rackets and gets an idea. Instead of having a player put on their shoes, they design them for the player. The player and the shoe will become a brand within themselves.<br/><br/>Sonny flies to LA to talk to his friend, George Raveling, because George coached Michael Jordan in the Olympic tournament. George believes Sonny's instincts are right about the rookie but warns Sonny that Michael's parents, James and Deloris, are strongholds in their son's career. Sonny returns to Nike's headquarters and pitches his idea to Howard White. Howard signed Moses Malone to a Nike deal that remains their best acquisition. Howard admits he called Moses's mom to finalize the deal. Sonny takes George and Howard's advice and meets with Jordan's parents. After a revealing conversation with Deloris, Jordan's manager, David, calls Sonny with a flurry of insults and a Monday meeting. Sonny runs to Peter Moore and asks him to design the best shoe Nike has ever created. Sonny doesn't know, but his decision to pursue Michael Jordan will change Nike, athletic sponsorships, and Michael Jordan's finances forever.<br/><br/>A lot of care went into making this film. The director ensures this isn't a Michael Jordan movie. It's about Sonny, Deloris, and Nike. Sonny is the man behind the curtain. He understood the psychology behind the sport, its players, and its coaches. However, the driving force behind this deal was Deloris Jordan. She knew her son's worth to the game and wouldn't compromise his future. The music and technology will transport you back to 1984. Also, this film gives recognition to Peter's genius. Sneakers weren't just a fashion statement for him. They were a work of art. While the language is a bit much for younger viewers, audiences will love this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Centuries ago, human wizards grew tired of the games the gods played with people. So they stole a branch off the Tree of Life, created the staff, took their magic, and trapped the daughters in their realm. They would stay powerless in their realm if the Wizard's staff stayed intact. Billy remembers having the Wizard's staff, breaking it in half, and leaving it after their battle with Dr. Thaddeus and the Seven Deadly Sins. They need to find the third sister, the staff, and the golden apple to save their realm from the Fury of the Gods.<br/><br/>Welcome D.C.E.U. fans to a sequel that's better than the first.

John asks the Elder for his ring and freedom. The Elder tells John the wedding ring is long gone with the previous Elder. And they won't free John either. John stands and shoots the Elder in the head.<br/><br/>Marquis Vincent de Gramont visits the New York Continental Hotel. He strips Winston of his title and condemns the hotel because Winston didn't kill John. And he wants to put an end to John Wick. It starts with New York. Vincent will make every city respect the High Table by demolishing John's flagship hotel. Vincent pulls out his gun and kills Charon. Charon is Winston's consequence for deceiving the High Table.<br/><br/>Vincent leaves New York and travels to Paris. He summons Caine, John's friend and a retired assassin for the High Table, for a meeting. Vincent gives Caine a card with his mark's name: John Wick. Caine sighs and agrees.<br/><br/>John runs to the Osaka Continental to meet with the manager, Koji, against the wishes of his concierge, Akira. No one sees Tracker in the lobby with a notebook full of information about John Wick. The bounty of $15,000,000 isn't enough for Tracker, but he will keep an eye on John while it rises. John tells Koji that he plans to kill every member of the High Table. Koji warns John that John's path will only lead to more killing and destruction.<br/><br/>John meets with Winston, who agrees with Koji, to offer condolences for the Continental and Charon. Winston offers John a better idea. Winston tells John to request a duel against Vincent. According to legend, a family must sponsor him in the duel, and he tore his ticket to gain passage. John needs to find a new family, obtain a ticket, request a duel, and kill Marquis Vincent de Gramont to free himself of the High Table for good.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of John Wick packs more plot than its predecessors but maintains all the action. The battles were well-timed, in sync with the music, and innovative. If you haven't seen the previous three films, watch them before watching this film. The movie doesn't take the time to catch viewers up on what happened and why. This film is funnier and wiser than the first three films. Don't worry, because this film has a lot of blood, guns, axes, and nunchucks. So it has all the cringe-inducing violence you love. The downside to this film is the unrealistic survival. Viewers could believe one man could live through these battles, but a 50-foot drop onto the pavement is too far for any stretch of your imagination. This movie is a fitting conclusion for John Wick fans with new characters and locations. Also, it has one post-credit scene at the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her.

Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
