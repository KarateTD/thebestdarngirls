	"review":"When Vanellope's game breaks, she and Ralph go to the Internet to find the steering wheel she needs.  While trying to earn money to afford it she needs for her game on the internet, Vanellope finds a new and exciting game called Slaughter Race.  Ralph wants to go back to their arcade but she wants to stay on the internet, leaving their friendship in the balance.  A great movie with a lot of heart and explores the true meaning of friendship.  But not as funny as the first.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Farrokh Bulsara changes his name to Freddie Mercury, quits his job, and meets a band after seeing them perform.  This chance encounter would bless the world with some of the best music written to date.  This movie is billed as the story of Queen but it is really an autobiography of Freddie Mercury.  Watching his rise, fall, and redemption is amazing and easy for you to sing along.  Watch this movie now and get your vocal cords ready to sing.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After witnessing her friend, Khalil, being shot by a police officer, Starr must determine if she should talk or remain quiet.  Her family, her friends, and her safety all hang in the balance.  This movie covers so many topics in 2 hours.  It covers police brutality, racism, no snitching, gang violence, the talk, and inherited hatred.  You should not pass judgement on this movie before you see it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.  This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
