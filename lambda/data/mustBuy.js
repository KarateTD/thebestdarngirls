    "review":"Barbie lives in her dreamhouse. She takes a waterless shower, eats her perfect pretend breakfast, and floats to her car. Barbie goes to the beach to relax, and Ken waits for Barbie to notice him. Ken asks to visit Barbie's house, and she invites him to her blowout party with choreography.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Barbie's party until Barbie asks them if they think about death. She laughs it off and continues dancing. In the morning, Barbie wakes up tired, her waterless shower is cold, and the pretend breakfast isn't edible. Barbie confesses that something is wrong, and the other Barbies tell her to go to Weird Barbie.<br/><br/>Barbie goes to Weird Barbie and tells her everything that happened. Barbie's little girl in the real world is sad, and it affects how she plays with Barbie. Barbie doesn't understand how this could happen because playing with Barbie made the lives of real girls perfect like her. Barbie heads to the real world with Ken stowing away in the backseat. She will find her girl, help her, and return to Barbieland with her body and mind in tack. However, the real world will change Barbieland in ways Barbie never dreamed, but Ken always imagined.<br/><br/>This movie starts with all the pink, butterflies, and glitter you expect from Barbie. It has all the Barbies you remember as a little child, even discontinued Barbies like Midge, Growing Up Skipper, and TV Barbie. When she enters the real world, she sees it isn't perfect. And little girls aren't thanking her for making a difference. Ken sees the human world and loves it. Men are working, driving big cars, and focusing on each other. The real world has a lasting effect on both of them.<br/><br/>As the trailer says, this film is for people who love and hate Barbie because it focuses on Barbie's issues while addressing her contributions. During the trip to Barbie, Barbie talks to her owner, Sasha, and Sasha's mother, Gloria. Gloria gives a speech to Barbie, who is having an existential crisis, and it will make you sigh with understanding and exhaustion. You leave this film with your eyes open, your feelings heard, and loving Barbie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Noah prepares for a job interview in 1994 but notices something is wrong with his little brother's hand. Noah runs to his job interview after the hospital refuses to treat Chris. Unfortunately, the interview is over. They got word from Noah's former commanding officer. Noah is a tech whiz and a soldier but not a team player.<br/><br/>Noah returns home with Chris feeling defeated. Noah needs to make money now to help his family, so he takes a shortcut and uses his technical expertise to boost cars. He finds a beautiful Porsche and uses a Jimmy to get inside. Noah turns on the radio and hears a voice yelling for Mirage to roll out. The vehicle puts itself in gear and starts a high-speed chase. After a wild ride through the streets of New York, the car morphs into Autobot Mirage. Mirage tells Noah to be cool because the others are coming and are not fond of humans.<br/><br/>Across town, Elena interns at a museum. Her boss, Jillian, brought in a statue that she claimed to be Egyptian. But Elena thinks it's much older. Elena sees Jillian's lab tech badge and uses it to gain unauthorized access to the examination equipment. As she scans the item, it breaks apart and reveals something inside. She doesn't see a stream of light emanating from it, but Optimus Prime does.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is in awe of the light. He knows it comes from the Transwarp Key. The key opens portals through time and space. Optimus can use it to send himself and the Autobots to their home world, Cybertron. He calls the Autobots - Bumblebee, Mirage, and Acree - to plan a way into the museum. The Autobots catch Noah trying to sneak out as they discuss ways to retrieve the key. Mirage gets an idea. They can have Noah get the key for them. Optimus isn't keen on the idea, but he knows Scourge can see the beacon too.<br/><br/>Scourge leads the Terrorcons and works for Unicron. Unicron fuels himself by eating planets. Unicron sent Scourge to find the key to become unstoppable. The last time Scourge saw the key was on the homeworld of the Maximals. Their leader, Apelinq, sacrificed himself so the Maximals, including Optimus Primal, could escape with their greatest technology: the Transwarp key. Optimus knows it's a matter of time before Scourge comes to Earth looking for it.<br/><br/>Noah enters the museum, and Elena confronts him. The Terrorcons shoot a hole in the museum as they argue over the artifact. After battling on the museum's front lawn, Scourge destroys Bumblebee's spark and leaves with the key. However, they only got half the key. She believes the other half of the key is in Peru. Elena, Noah, and the Autobots head to Peru, with Scourge not far behind. Who will win the battle of the key?<br/><br/>Inspired by Transformers, this movie takes place after Bumblebee but serves as a prequel to the Transformers movie series. The intro gives the audience a glimpse of the Maximals and their mission before coming to Earth. However, the plot assumes you know the story of the Transformers. While Mirage delivers comic relief, the storyline focuses on brotherly relationships. The animation is crisp and not offputting. Luckily, the writers didn't add an unnecessary romance. Be prepared for a surprise in the final scene that will push this franchise into the future. Also, there is one mid-credit scene. This film is as enjoyable as Bumblebee but doesn't drag like the other Transformers films. It is a rejuvenated addition to the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Prince Eric sails the seven seas with his men. He wants to discover uncharted waters and find undiscovered land. Eric's advisor, Sir Grimsby, cautions Eric about carelessly putting his life on the line at sea. There are tales of the Sea King who will kill land dwellers as his daughters lore them with song. Eric is grateful that Queen Selina and the King adopted him, but he always feels out of place behind the castle walls.<br/><br/>Princess Ariel explores a shipwreck for human artifacts with her friend, Flounder. After escaping a ferocious shark, Ariel runs into her friend, Sebastian. Sebastian tells Ariel she is late for her father's meeting with her six sisters. Ariel rushes to her father, King Triton, knowing he will be upset. The king excuses her sisters and reminds Ariel not to go near savage humans. Ariel regretfully accepts the king's conditions and retreats to her hidden cave of treasures from the surface world.<br/><br/>The sailors shoot fireworks for Eric's birthday, and the lights in the sky draw Ariel to the surface. Then, a wave hits the ship and takes it down. Eric saves his men and dog but gets thrown off the other side of the boat. Ariel finds Eric and pulls him to safety. Before Eric's vision clears, Ariel swims away because Eric's people started running to him.<br/><br/>When Sebastian tells King Triton, the king goes to Ariel's cave and destroys all her trinkets. She tells her to never go to the surface again. Then, Ariel hears a voice in the distance. It's her Aunt Ursula. Ursula sees Ariel cares for Eric, but Ariel must become human to be with him. In return, Ariel will get legs. If Ariel receives true love's kiss in three days, she will remain a human forever. Otherwise, Ariel will be under Ursula's control for eternity. Ariel gets legs and swims to the surface before she drowns.<br/><br/>The people of Eric's kingdom take the mute and clumsy woman back to the castle. He sees Ariel and offers her a place to stay for as long as she wants. He doesn't recognize her and is too preoccupied with finding the woman who saved him. Ursula put a hidden clause in the agreement. Ariel would forget the kiss clause the moment she reached the surface. Now, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle must get Eric and Ariel to kiss in 3 days, or Ariel will become Ursula's minion forever.<br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of the classic Little Mermaid while making necessary changes. While Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder look more realistic, other animals have a 'Finding Nemo' feel. The musical performance has the source material's emotions, vigor, and theatrics. And the new songs blend in seamlessly with the plot. The updated storyline makes Ariel and Eric the same. They are two people looking for more in the world. However, their overprotective parents keep them behind walls because of preconceived notions about others. Don't miss Jodi Benson passing the dinglehopper to Halle Bailey. The only downside to this movie is that it is too long for children. Otherwise, this is a delightful and highly-entertaining film for the entire family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sonny Vaccaro looks through game tapes to find the next athletic sponsor for Nike. The CEO, Phil Knight, authorized $250,000 for three players. Sonny has plenty on his shoulders because Nike's basketball division is floundering. Sonny sits in a marketing meeting with its head, Rob Strasser, and looks through the 1984 NBA draft picks. Sonny wants them to consider Michael Jordan, but the staff knows Jordan is expensive and prefers Adidas. Sonny leaves the meeting upset and looks over more college basketball tapes. While watching, he sees an Arthur Ashe commercial for tennis rackets and gets an idea. Instead of having a player put on their shoes, they design them for the player. The player and the shoe will become a brand within themselves.<br/><br/>Sonny flies to LA to talk to his friend, George Raveling, because George coached Michael Jordan in the Olympic tournament. George believes Sonny's instincts are right about the rookie but warns Sonny that Michael's parents, James and Deloris, are strongholds in their son's career. Sonny returns to Nike's headquarters and pitches his idea to Howard White. Howard signed Moses Malone to a Nike deal that remains their best acquisition. Howard admits he called Moses's mom to finalize the deal. Sonny takes George and Howard's advice and meets with Jordan's parents. After a revealing conversation with Deloris, Jordan's manager, David, calls Sonny with a flurry of insults and a Monday meeting. Sonny runs to Peter Moore and asks him to design the best shoe Nike has ever created. Sonny doesn't know, but his decision to pursue Michael Jordan will change Nike, athletic sponsorships, and Michael Jordan's finances forever.<br/><br/>A lot of care went into making this film. The director ensures this isn't a Michael Jordan movie. It's about Sonny, Deloris, and Nike. Sonny is the man behind the curtain. He understood the psychology behind the sport, its players, and its coaches. However, the driving force behind this deal was Deloris Jordan. She knew her son's worth to the game and wouldn't compromise his future. The music and technology will transport you back to 1984. Also, this film gives recognition to Peter's genius. Sneakers weren't just a fashion statement for him. They were a work of art. While the language is a bit much for younger viewers, audiences will love this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Indiana Jones and Basil Shaw battle the Nazis to recover the Lance of Longinus on a Nazi plunder train. However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist Jürgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half. Jones takes Helena to the school's archives and removes the machine from a hidden drawer. When CIA operatives distract Jones, Helena grabs the Dial and runs away.<br/><br/>The operatives work for Voller, who now hides as a NASA scientist on the recently-successful Apollo 11 project. They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"J. Robert Oppenheimer sits in front of a security hearing board because he wants to maintain his security clearance. He recounts his life before and during his government work under scads scrutiny. He teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and dedicates time to the California Institute of Technology. Oppenheimer crosses paths with Ernest Lawrence, Jean Tatlock, and his future wife, Katherine Puening.<br/><br/>General Leslie Groves seeks out Oppenheimer to work on the Manhattan Project but worries Oppenheimer's communist ties will delay his clearance. Oppenheimer assures Groves that he only has an academic interest in the party, not a devotion. Oppenheimer wasn't sure about creating the Atomic Bomb but wanted to end World War II. So he agreed to do it because the only scientist in Germany with Oppenheimer's knowledge was Jewish. They know Hitler won't give him funding.<br/><br/>Oppenheimer convinces Groves to create a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with places to pray, shop, and attend school. Oppenheimer and his researchers work before the town is complete, and William L. Borden enters with startling calculations. His math proves the Atomic Bomb could cause an explosion in the atmosphere and create a chain reaction that destroys the world. Oppenheimer asks Lewis Strauss to introduce him to Albert Einstein. He gives Albert the calculations, and Albert confirms them. Oppenheimer must continue his work with the constant threat of annihilation hanging over his head. And he will bring death to thousands if it works as expected. Can Oppenheimer accept the applause and responsibility of being a modern-day Prometheus?<br/><br/>The director made this movie with extreme precision for the period, the scientists, and their struggles. If you pay close attention, this historical film has the drama of a daytime soap opera. This movie follows Oppenheimer's life before, during, and after the Atomic Bomb. It acknowledges his flaws and brilliance throughout his career. Also, it addresses some controversies and conspiracies that surrounded him. This battle is compelling because it's between two competitive, intelligent, and petty men. This movie covers ample history, but it's not for children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

The plot sticks to AI and Machine Learning fears in other films, but the action sets it apart. There are zero mid-credit or post-credit scenes. And yes, it ends on the perfect cliffhanger.

    "mtitle":"Dumb Money",
    "review":"Keith Gill, a financial broker for MassMutual, meets with his friend, Briggsy, at a bar to discuss their investments. Keith admits that he invested $53,000 into GameStop. Briggsy can't believe it because hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, are shorting the stock. Keith goes home to his wife, Caroline, and baby girl. He posted his ideas on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, but no one listened. Caroline tells him to make another video. Keith walks to his basement, changes his shirt, puts on a red headband, and goes live as Roaring Kitty.<br/><br/>Jenny, a nurse, is a divorced mother of two and follows Wall Street Bets. She listens to Roaring Kitty and buys GameStop stock on the Robinhood app. Marcos works at GameStop and sees it struggling. Marcos decides to put a few dollars into GameStop after watching the stream. RiRi, a college student, has over $100,000 in student loan debt. She invested money into GameStop and encouraged others to do the same. Harmony listens to RiRi, watches Roaring Kitty, and starts to invest while falling for RiRi.<br/><br/>By January, Steve Cohen calls Gabe about GME. He warns Gabe that one person is driving up the buying. Gabe watches a few clips and doubles down on the short sale. Ken Griffin laughs at retail investors and calls them Dumb Money. The hedge fund managers aren't the only people watching GameStop. Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, owners of the Robinhood App, saw the number of users skyrocket. But none of them know that the Apes will expose Robinhood and cause a short squeeze that will spark a media frenzy, social payback, and a congressional hearing.<br/><br/>Based on The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, this movie mixes real-life events with a compilation of stories from retail investors. The plot doesn't describe how to short a stock, what hedge funds are, or what a short squeeze is. Instead, the audience gets to know the man behind Roaring Kitty. He ignited the masses and made investment companies take the Apes seriously. This film has engaging dialogue, great music, and realistic portrayals. It gives you an overview of the players, their jobs, and their net worth. The audience sees how they all fared at the end. They wanted to take down the system but became the product. So, sit back, take notes, and enjoy the social gamification of the market.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hercule Poirot retires in Venice and avoids new cases with the help of his bodyguard, Vitale Portfoglio. Vitale runs to Hercule's rooftop with a message from a friend. Then, Vitale shows Hercule an apple, and Hercule knows that author Ariadne Oliver is there. An actress, Rowena Drake, hired a medium, Joyce Reynolds, to communicate with her deceased daughter, Alicia, in a séance. Alicia committed suicide after her fiancé, Maxime, left her and six months later became engaged to another woman. Ariadne was able to uncover fakes before but believes Joyce is the real deal. Ariadne is writing a book about Joyce, and proving Joyce wrong will make the book a best-seller.<br/><br/>Hercule, Ariadne, and Vitale arrive at Rowena's home and hear it's haunted history. Rowena opens her doors to let the children play on Halloween, but Leopold wants to read his book instead. Leopold doesn't want to participate in the activities because his father, Dr. Ferrier, suffers from trauma. Joyce arrives with her assistant, Desdemona Holland, wearing a cloak and mask. Before everyone walks into the salon, Rowena's housekeeper, Olga Semioff, screams at the front door. Maxime received an invitation to the séance and demands to attend.<br/><br/>Joyce puts a typewriter in the corner of the room, and Desdemona stands next to it. Joyce has Olga, Ariadne, Dr. Ferrier, Leopold, and Rowena surround her as she calls Alicia to speak from beyond the grave. Hercule stops the séance and exposes Joyce's fraud. Desdemona's half-brother, Nicholas, hid in the fireplace and signaled the typewriter. As Hercule readies to put the case to bed, windows fly open, and Joyce spends around uncontrollably speaking with Alicia's voice. She comes out of the trance and offers more information about Alicia's killer in the morning.<br/><br/>Privately, Hercule confronts Joyce for using Rowena's desperation for financial gain. Joyce he puts her mask and cloak on Hercule and tells him to do better than her. Hercule indulges in a children's game of bobbing apples, and someone pushes his face into the water. He wakes up to Vitale standing over him. Then, they all hear a scream and find Joyce impaled after someone threw her off a balcony. Hercule locks everyone inside the house and plans to investigate. Hercule doesn't believe in ghosts or God but starts to see and hear things around the house. Can Hercule uncover the killer before losing his mind?<br/><br/>Based on Hallowe'en Party by Agatha Christie, this movie starts with Hercule happily leaving the mystery world behind. The house has a horrid history with a plague, causing doctors and nurses to leave children to die. This tale leaves the plot open to ghosts with targets in their crosshairs. This film has plot points from Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. Hercule fans know to keep their eyes and ears open for every clue. And this time, you may spot the nugget of truth hidden in a brief exchange. This movie isn't the best, but you will leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The Paw Patrol gets a distress call from the J and H Junkyard. Someone stole their 10-ton magnet and started a fire during the getaway. The pups save Janet and Hank but wonder why someone would steal it. They don't ponder for long because they want to run home to see the meteor shower over Adventure Bay. The crew readies the snacks as Ryder introduces them to The Junior Patrollers, Nano, Tot, and Mini. The meteor is heading toward Adventure Bay. They run to the town, secure everyone, and clear a path. Ryder and the pups go to the crater and find the meteor pulsating. Ryder decides to examine it in his lab.<br/><br/>The news reports that Victoria Vance pulled the meteor to Earth and broadcast her crime on social media. She used the powerful magnet to attract the meteor because something powerful was inside. The police find her post, arrest Victoria, and put her in jail. Her new cellmate is Mayor Humdinger and his cats.<br/><br/>A bright light wakes up Skye, and she walks towards it. She touches the meteor, and it shatters, leaving seven crystals behind. One crystal attaches to her collar, and Sky can fly. Each crystal latches on to them. Rubble becomes a wrecking ball while Chase gets super speed. Zuma can control and become water, while Marshall can shoot fireballs from his paws. And Zuma becomes Magneto. Liberty tries with all her might but doesn't have powers. Adventure Bay marvels at their upgraded heroes and plasters them all over the news. Victoria sees the report and vows to take back the pups' powers. Humdinger offers to help break Victoria out if she shares their abilities. Can the Paw Patrol defeat Victoria and Humdinger before she takes their powers?<br/><br/>Before the movie starts, their is a short music video, a Dora short, and Pup theater etiquette for the kids. This constant change may confuse younger viewers, so parents should be ready to explain. The film is good clean entertainment with lots of action. Also, it provides an origin story for Skye. The graphics and storyline are fun for the entire family. There are jokes for adults, but they are not innuendoes. The movie is comically self-aware and entertains without dumbing down the content or making inappropriate quips over kids' heads. Bring the entire family to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars for kids and 3.5 out of 5 stars for adults.",
