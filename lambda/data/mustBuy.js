    "review":"Brian Brown-Easley stands outside Wells Fargo and thinks about his daughter and ex-wife. He walks inside and enters his information on a deposit slip. Rosa, a bank teller, calls Brian to her counter and makes small talk. He quietly asks Rosa for a piece of paper and writes a note. It reads, 'I have a bomb.' Rosa looks at her bank manager, Estel, with unbridled panic and fear in her eyes. They offer to give him money, but that's not what Brian wants. He wants Rosa and Estel to get news reporters and police on the scene. For months, Brian felt ignored and unheard. The VA and Lincoln College of Technology stole his money, and he wants the VA to pay it back.<br/><br/>Based on 'They Didn't Have to Kill Him': The Death of Lance Cpl. Brian Easley by Aaron Gell, this movie covers many topics plaguing US veterans, including homelessness, PTSD, job insecurity, and the VA.. It's painful to watch this kind man fight for the little money he had. For the soldiers that give everything for the US, it's disgusting that they have to jump through hoops to get anything back. Your heart will sink when Brian says the amount he's fighting over. Maybe, this movie will be the first step to righting some wrongs.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Yuichi Kimura sits near a hospital bed, where his son, Wataru, is in a coma. As Wataru's grandfather, The Elder, walks in, Yuichi reports that someone pushed Wataru off a roof. Yuichi found a note. The note states that Wataru's attacker will be on the bullet train headed to Kyoto in seat B4. As he approaches B4 with a gun, Yuichi finds a young girl sitting there. He apologizes, and she stuns him. The young girl is known as The Prince and wants to use Yuichi to set up her target, The White Death.<br/><br/>Maria's called her best snatch-and-grab man, Ladybug, for a job after The Carver fell ill. After some time with his therapist, Barry, Ladybug is ready to return to work. Maria wants Ladybug to board the bullet train and find a silver briefcase with train stickers and get off at the next stop.<br/><br/>Lemon and Tangerine are twin brothers working for The White Death. The White Death's enemies kidnapped his son, The Son, and held him for ransom. Lemon and Tangerine faked a ransom drop, killed the kidnappers, and got The Son. They will ride the bullet train and return The Son and the briefcase of money to The White Death.<br/><br/>A mobster raised The Wolf after The Wolf's mother died. Now, The Wolf is a contract killer for the mob boss. Years later, The Wolf marries his girlfriend in a white tuxedo with the mob in attendance. The Wolf raised his glass of red wine just as a waiter bumped him, spilling wine on The Wolf's tux. The Wolf left to clean his suit and got a bloody shock. All his guests, including his wife, were bleeding from their eyes and mouths. They all died. Later, someone uncovered that The Hornet poisoned The Wolf's wedding, and now The Hornet will be on the bullet train. These killers are on the same train with a different mission. However, they will collide with a Fiji bottle, a barrette, a sticker, and one unfortunate incident. Oh, and there is a venomous snake loose on the train.<br/><br/>If you miss one second, go home. Based on Bullet Train by Kōtarō Isaka, this movie has surprises throughout the plot that will make you gasp, laugh, and scream. Between Ladybug's therapy wisdom and Lemon's Thomas the Tank Engine obsession, the audience will find quick laughs between the bloodshed. While the story isn't linear, the director placed the flashbacks in the right place to move the story forward. There is one mid-credit scene that will bring you to a visual zen. If you love Ambulance's action, John Wick's humor, and Death on the Nile's mystery, this is the right movie for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ika Chu puts the finishing touches on the Shogun's palace before the Shogun arrives. There is a lot to do, but Ika Chu needs his cats to remove one eyesore blocking the perfect view. It's a small town called Kakamucho, protected by a samurai. When the samurai sees the mass amount of cat warriors heading to the town, the samurai runs away, leaving Kakamucho defenseless.<br/><br/>The citizens of Kakamucho demand the Shogun send a new samurai, and the Shogun delegates the job to Ika Chu. He sees a dog, Hank, facing execution for walking into cat territory. Hank admits to crossing the border only to receive samurai training. Ika Chu appoints Hank the new samurai because he knows the cats of Kakamucho will kill a dog on sight.<br/><br/>Ika Chu's prediction is correct, and the cats attack Hank. But they stop when Hank proves he is the new samurai. Hank meets Jimbo, a hesitant sensei with too much catnip, and convinces Jimbo to train him. Ika Chu can't fathom the cats accepting this dog, so he vows to destroy Hank and Kakamucho before Shogun arrives.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Blazing Saddles, this movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, the characters never forget it's a movie. It takes everyday activities, like tweeting, and transforms the tweet into an actual bird. This film is an animated, classic comedy you grew up watching. It's worth every penny, and you will enjoy it more than your children.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bri's father, Lawless, is a rap legend in Garden Heights, and she aspires to be a rapper like him. However, he died when she was a baby. Her aunt, Pooh, got Bri a spot at The Ring, a rap arena owned by DJ Hype. Bri sells candy at school to classmates to help her mom. Her friends, Malik and Sonny, believe Bri has what it takes to make it in the music industry.<br/><br/>At her first rap battle, Bri's opponent remarks about her father and mother. Bri can't shake the feeling, so she chokes and leaves The Ring. When an officer sees Bri take something out of her bag and exchange it for money, he demands to see her bookbag. Bri refuses, so the officer grabs her and slams her to the floor. Teachers say Bri is aggressive, but Jay wants to know if the SROs will suffer consequences. The principal says the SROs behavior was inexcusable, but the principal will suspend Bri for a week during the investigation.<br/><br/>Bri uses the time to write more rhymes and gets another shot at The Ring. This time, Bri defeats a locally known rapper, Milez, and Milez's father, Supreme, takes notice. Supreme managed her father until the day Lawless died, but Pooh tells Bri to stay away from Supreme. Pooh and Bri go to the parking lot on cloud nine, but their good mood dissipates when they see Pooh's friend in an altercation with a rival gang. Pooh pulls out a gun and refuses to back down, so the gang leaves.<br/><br/>Pooh and Bri return to The Ring for the next battle, but DJ Hype bans Pooh and Bri for bringing a weapon. Instead of leaving, Bri battles a rapper in the parking lot and wins. In desperation, Bri messages Supreme on Instagram. Bri gets in the booth, but producers hate her single. So she makes a song talking about the rival gang, her family, and the SROs. This song will be Bri's first hit, but she doesn't understand that it's a statement that will anger the streets, her family, and her school.<br/><br/>Based on On the Come Up by Angie Thomas, this movie is a coming-of-age story with prose. This film, at first, feels like 8 Mile, but winning the battle isn't the story's goal. Bri has to find her voice and fight through the pain. She must thrive, not just survive. Bri learns the power of song, its effect on others, and the perils of playing the role. In the end, Bri finds her voice using her pain and stands up for herself and her family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1823 West Africa, the Agojie of the Dahomey Kingdom returned from a fierce battle with their captured people and prisoners from Migan's tribe. King Ghezo instructs his people not to look at the Agojie. General Nanisca stands in front of trainees and tells them the rules of joining her elite warriors. Among the trainees is Nawi. Nawi's father tried to force her to marry an older man, but the man slapped her when she wouldn't speak to him. Nawi's father dragged her to Ghezo's palace and gave Nawi to Ghezo.<br/><br/>Ghezo and one of his wives sit in front of his council and discuss the future of Dahomey. Nanisca warns the king that trading prisoners into slavery for western weapons will weaken Africa. Another advisor tells the king that selling their enemies into slavery will strengthen their kingdom.<br/><br/>Migan enters Dahomey for Ghezo's tribute to the Oyo Empire. His kingdom controls the port Dahomey needs to keep the slave trade. Migan notices that the tribute is short and tells Ghezo that he wants 20 Agojie to make up for the shortfall. Instead of giving Migan 20 warriors, Nanisca declares war. Migan believes the Dahomey kingdom is getting bolder. So, he entices other tribes and western slavers to band together to bring them down. Nanisca will need to look her horrific past in the face to defeat the oncoming attack.<br/><br/>This movie is a warrior's tale with bits of history thrown into the plot. Viewers should use this film as a starting point to do more research on the Dahomey kingdom and the Oyo Empire. Within the story, viewers get revenge, love, jealousy, and excellent choreography. The astounding details on costumes, hair, and makeup are unforgettable. However, there is an audible difference between native African speakers and those from other countries. The flip in tone and dialect can be distracting.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A year after King T'Challa died, Princess Shuri worked tirelessly to update Wakandan technology, but she stopped trying to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb. Her mother, Queen Ramonda, is fighting a political war with the United Nations. She will never share vibranium until the world is trustworthy. Ramonda returns home to make Shuri take part in a ritual. One year after a loved one passes, you burn your funeral ceremonial robe to honor them and relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>Shuri goes to the water's edge and watches Ramonda throw her robe into the fire, but Shuri refuses. Then, they notice a man coming from the water with wings on his ankles. Ramonda and Shuri dawn spears and demand to know who he is and why he speaks to them. He says his allies call him K'uk'ulkan, but his enemies say Namor. He says that Wakanda exposed his kingdom, Talokan, to great danger when they revealed the secret of vibranium. An American scientist was able to build a device that could detect the presence of the material. They want the Wakandans to bring them the American scientist so they can kill her, or they will destroy Wakanda.<br/><br/>Okoye decides to track down Agent Ross to reveal the location of the American scientist, and she convinces Ramonda to let Shuri go with her to get Shuri out of the lab. They unapologetically convince RiRi to come to Wakanda to keep her safe from a threat of unknown strength. However, Okoye and Shuri encounter hostile agents during their RiRi rescue, and Talokan warriors kidnap two of the women. Now, K'uk'ulkan gives Wakanda two options. One: Join his fight to destroy the land dwellers before they destroy his homeland for their resources. Or two: He will drown Wakanda and everyone in it.<br/><br/>And that's act one of this gut-wrenching, exciting, and loving tribute to Marvel's beloved king. The opening scene and the title card will have everyone in tears as it pays homage to a worthy figure in life and the comics. Then the plot introduces viewers to a new world with stunning but somewhat realistic imagery. You can see how this world mirrors Wakanda. Shuri and K'uk'ulkan are two sides of the same coin. They are children dealing with generational pain and devasting loss in a homeland under constant threat. RiRi is the new kid on the block. She swears, is an open book, and, while a bit naive, has some trust issues. It should go without saying, but the costumes, makeup, and art are second to none and help you delve deeper into this history-rich mythical world. Stay for the mid-credit scene, but their isn't an end-credit scene.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Gigi and Nate",
    "review":"Carolyn enters a petting zoo in California, which doubles as a traveling circus, and finds a scared capuchin monkey named Gigi. She coaxes the primate out of her corner and into a cage. Carolyn and her facility spend years training Gigi to become a service monkey.<br/><br/>Nate stood at the top of a cliff and jumped into the water while his friend, Benji, filmed it. A few days later, Nate celebrates the 4th of July with his mother, Claire, grandmother, Mama Blanche, and sisters, Katy and Annabelle. His father, Dan, couldn't make it because thunderstorms delayed his flight. Before dinner is over, Nate is in the bathroom, burning up, and vomiting. They rush Nate to the hospital, and the doctors run tests. There, doctors diagnose Nate with meningitis. It caused Nate's brain to swell, and now Nate can barely move his arms and legs.<br/><br/>Four years later, Nate, in a wheelchair, attempts to end his life. Dan saves him, and Claire makes a phone call to Carolyn. Carolyn tells Claire that Gigi is ready to help Nate, but it will take time for Gigi to adjust to Nate, Nate's surroundings, and Nate's needs. Nate takes Gigi everywhere for newfound independence. As they walk up and down the grocery aisles, a woman, Chloe, approaches Nate about Gigi. Chloe tells Nate and Claire that having Gigi around food products is against the law. Nate apologizes and leaves, but Claire gives Chloe a stern warning. After a party, social media, and beer pong, animal rights activists want to take Gigi away from Nate. Nate needs to convince the court that Gigi is safe and capuchins are suitable service animals.<br/><br/>Gigi and Nate's writers give viewers time to understand and appreciate the bond between a human and primate with wit, patience, and curious moments. And yes, the story is about Gigi, but it does not put the sole focus on her. It allows Nate's older sister, Katy, and parents, Claire and Dan, to connect with the audience and share their personal struggles. However, it doesn't offer an update for the actual Nate and Gigi. Also, the edits and CGI of the monkey versus dog chase lack the technical know-how and take the viewers out of the movie experience.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
