    "review":"John walked on a frozen lake and fell through the ice.  After 20 minutes underwater and 25 minutes of rescue efforts, the nurses stop working to allow John's mother to say her goodbyes.  As she prays for God to save her son, his heart starts beating again.  She will need her faith, her family, and her pastor to get her through as she prays for her son.<br/><br/>This movie will have you in tears.  While it shows John's journey, it doesn't sugar coat his mom's struggles.  She appeared to be a rock but she was pushing others away.  Also, this movie gives insight into John's experience after his survival.  See it with the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

The Skrulls uncover memories she thought were dreams.  She escapes the machine and jumps into an escape pod that veers off course to C-53, a.k.a. Earth.  On earth, Vers will learn the truth about her powers, the Kree, and the Skrulls.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the MCU need to watch the other films before watching this movie.  There are a lot of jokes and references to the past and present that will not make sense without knowledge of these movies.  With so much history to cover before the initial story, the first 10 minutes feels extremely rushed.  If you miss it, you will miss everything.  And 90s babies, be ready for some nostalgia.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

This family needs to stick together to save Zak and encourage Saraya.<br/><br/>This isn't just another wrestling movie, it's about family and dreams versus reality.  Saraya has to overcome her lack of strength, her misconceptions, and self-doubts.

Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.<br/><br/>This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Once it gets going, it never stops.  And it has more twist and turns than a soap opera.  See it today and hope for a part 2.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Only Jafar and his ambition to become Sultan stand in Aladdin's way.<br/><br/>This live adaption of the animated movie pays the highest respect to he original material. It doesn't change the story but adds to it.  It gives Princess Jasmine a song and a big dance.  The Genie keeps his comedic appearance while Iago and Abu are the best right-hand men.  The CGI was great for everyone but Genie.  At times, the head moved independently from it's CGI body and it was very distracting.  Because of this, 3D is a bad idea for this movie.  However, it is great for the whole family and you will feel an urge to see the play.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Every assassin in the world will be after him and no one will offer help.  John uses the hour to find a safe place for his dog, get a ticket, get a marker, and get some gold coins.  Since some assassins couldn't wait for an hour, John needed to seek medical treatment.  In the middle of getting stitches, John's time runs out and the doctor stops the work.  John has to complete is stitches and heads to the Director.  He asks the Director to give him passage to Casablanca.  He knows an assassin there who can lead him to the High Table.  He hopes to plead his case so the High Table will let him live.<br/><br/>This movie proves better weapons, excellent choreographed fights, and mind blowing cinematography is all action lovers need.  With so much going on, this movie provides 30 to 45 minutes of dialogue.  It gives you more of John's training history with the Director but not enough information of the blood oath between him and Sophia.  Seeing John Wick 2 is necessary for this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Woody, knowing his job is to protect Bonnie, hitches a ride in her backpack to help her with kindergarten orientation.  With Woody's helping hand, Bonnie makes Forky.  While Forky is her favorite toy, he dreams of going into the trash.  Woody spends every moment trying to save Forky from himself for Bonnie.  But when Woody and Forky are separated from Bonnie on a family trip, Woody has to bring Forky back to her.  He will need Bo Peep, Buzz, Duke Caboom, and Officer Giggle McDimples to come to his rescue.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is everything you thought it would be and more.  With hilarious running gags, stupendous CGI, and astounding voice acting, you are in a trance of wonderment.  Adults and children will love this story alike.  While Jessie, Rex, and Ham are background characters, the story of Woody shines through.  He is so focused on helping Forky with his existential crisis, Woody doesn't see he is having his own.  Not until Bo Peep calls him a lost toy.  While 3D isn't necessary, stay past the end credits for an oddly satisfying moment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Now, Nick wants Peter to go to Prague with Mysterio to stop the most powerful element, Fire.  Peter wants to enjoy his vacation with his friends, so he turns down Nick's offer.  Before Peter and his friends board the bus, the teacher informs them the trip got an upgrade and they are going to Prague.  Peter knows fury has hijacked their vacation.
