    "mtitle":"Dumb Money",
    "review":"Keith Gill, a financial broker for MassMutual, meets with his friend, Briggsy, at a bar to discuss their investments. Keith admits that he invested $53,000 into GameStop. Briggsy can't believe it because hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, are shorting the stock. Keith goes home to his wife, Caroline, and baby girl. He posted his ideas on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, but no one listened. Caroline tells him to make another video. Keith walks to his basement, changes his shirt, puts on a red headband, and goes live as Roaring Kitty.<br/><br/>Jenny, a nurse, is a divorced mother of two and follows Wall Street Bets. She listens to Roaring Kitty and buys GameStop stock on the Robinhood app. Marcos works at GameStop and sees it struggling. Marcos decides to put a few dollars into GameStop after watching the stream. RiRi, a college student, has over $100,000 in student loan debt. She invested money into GameStop and encouraged others to do the same. Harmony listens to RiRi, watches Roaring Kitty, and starts to invest while falling for RiRi.<br/><br/>By January, Steve Cohen calls Gabe about GME. He warns Gabe that one person is driving up the buying. Gabe watches a few clips and doubles down on the short sale. Ken Griffin laughs at retail investors and calls them Dumb Money. The hedge fund managers aren't the only people watching GameStop. Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, owners of the Robinhood App, saw the number of users skyrocket. But none of them know that the Apes will expose Robinhood and cause a short squeeze that will spark a media frenzy, social payback, and a congressional hearing.<br/><br/>Based on The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, this movie mixes real-life events with a compilation of stories from retail investors. The plot doesn't describe how to short a stock, what hedge funds are, or what a short squeeze is. Instead, the audience gets to know the man behind Roaring Kitty. He ignited the masses and made investment companies take the Apes seriously. This film has engaging dialogue, great music, and realistic portrayals. It gives you an overview of the players, their jobs, and their net worth. The audience sees how they all fared at the end. They wanted to take down the system but became the product. So, sit back, take notes, and enjoy the social gamification of the market.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie",
    "review":"The Paw Patrol gets a distress call from the J and H Junkyard. Someone stole their 10-ton magnet and started a fire during the getaway. The pups save Janet and Hank but wonder why someone would steal it. They don't ponder for long because they want to run home to see the meteor shower over Adventure Bay. The crew readies the snacks as Ryder introduces them to The Junior Patrollers, Nano, Tot, and Mini. The meteor is heading toward Adventure Bay. They run to the town, secure everyone, and clear a path. Ryder and the pups go to the crater and find the meteor pulsating. Ryder decides to examine it in his lab.<br/><br/>The news reports that Victoria Vance pulled the meteor to Earth and broadcast her crime on social media. She used the powerful magnet to attract the meteor because something powerful was inside. The police find her post, arrest Victoria, and put her in jail. Her new cellmate is Mayor Humdinger and his cats.<br/><br/>A bright light wakes up Skye, and she walks towards it. She touches the meteor, and it shatters, leaving seven crystals behind. One crystal attaches to her collar, and Sky can fly. Each crystal latches on to them. Rubble becomes a wrecking ball while Chase gets super speed. Zuma can control and become water, while Marshall can shoot fireballs from his paws. And Zuma becomes Magneto. Liberty tries with all her might but doesn't have powers. Adventure Bay marvels at their upgraded heroes and plasters them all over the news. Victoria sees the report and vows to take back the pups' powers. Humdinger offers to help break Victoria out if she shares their abilities. Can the Paw Patrol defeat Victoria and Humdinger before she takes their powers?<br/><br/>Before the movie starts, their is a short music video, a Dora short, and Pup theater etiquette for the kids. This constant change may confuse younger viewers, so parents should be ready to explain. The film is good clean entertainment with lots of action. Also, it provides an origin story for Skye. The graphics and storyline are fun for the entire family. There are jokes for adults, but they are not innuendoes. The movie is comically self-aware and entertains without dumbing down the content or making inappropriate quips over kids' heads. Bring the entire family to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars for kids and 3.5 out of 5 stars for adults.",

    "mtitle":"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny",
    "review":"Indiana Jones and Basil Shaw battle the Nazis to recover the Lance of Longinus on a Nazi plunder train. However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist Jürgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half. Jones takes Helena to the school's archives and removes the machine from a hidden drawer. When CIA operatives distract Jones, Helena grabs the Dial and runs away.<br/><br/>The operatives work for Voller, who now hides as a NASA scientist on the recently-successful Apollo 11 project. They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hercule Poirot retires in Venice and avoids new cases with the help of his bodyguard, Vitale Portfoglio. Vitale runs to Hercule's rooftop with a message from a friend. Then, Vitale shows Hercule an apple, and Hercule knows that author Ariadne Oliver is there. An actress, Rowena Drake, hired a medium, Joyce Reynolds, to communicate with her deceased daughter, Alicia, in a séance. Alicia committed suicide after her fiancé, Maxime, left her and six months later became engaged to another woman. Ariadne was able to uncover fakes before but believes Joyce is the real deal. Ariadne is writing a book about Joyce, and proving Joyce wrong will make the book a best-seller.<br/><br/>Hercule, Ariadne, and Vitale arrive at Rowena's home and hear it's haunted history. Rowena opens her doors to let the children play on Halloween, but Leopold wants to read his book instead. Leopold doesn't want to participate in the activities because his father, Dr. Ferrier, suffers from trauma. Joyce arrives with her assistant, Desdemona Holland, wearing a cloak and mask. Before everyone walks into the salon, Rowena's housekeeper, Olga Semioff, screams at the front door. Maxime received an invitation to the séance and demands to attend.<br/><br/>Joyce puts a typewriter in the corner of the room, and Desdemona stands next to it. Joyce has Olga, Ariadne, Dr. Ferrier, Leopold, and Rowena surround her as she calls Alicia to speak from beyond the grave. Hercule stops the séance and exposes Joyce's fraud. Desdemona's half-brother, Nicholas, hid in the fireplace and signaled the typewriter. As Hercule readies to put the case to bed, windows fly open, and Joyce spends around uncontrollably speaking with Alicia's voice. She comes out of the trance and offers more information about Alicia's killer in the morning.<br/><br/>Privately, Hercule confronts Joyce for using Rowena's desperation for financial gain. Joyce he puts her mask and cloak on Hercule and tells him to do better than her. Hercule indulges in a children's game of bobbing apples, and someone pushes his face into the water. He wakes up to Vitale standing over him. Then, they all hear a scream and find Joyce impaled after someone threw her off a balcony. Hercule locks everyone inside the house and plans to investigate. Hercule doesn't believe in ghosts or God but starts to see and hear things around the house. Can Hercule uncover the killer before losing his mind?<br/><br/>Based on Hallowe'en Party by Agatha Christie, this movie starts with Hercule happily leaving the mystery world behind. The house has a horrid history with a plague, causing doctors and nurses to leave children to die. This tale leaves the plot open to ghosts with targets in their crosshairs. This film has plot points from Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. Hercule fans know to keep their eyes and ears open for every clue. And this time, you may spot the nugget of truth hidden in a brief exchange. This movie isn't the best, but you will leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Supremor Dar-Benn finds one of the Universal Bands, but the other is missing. She uses her Universal Weapon to charge the Band and rips open a jump point through space.<br/><br/>Nick Fury watches Monica Rambeau fix satellites from the SABER space station. He calls Carol Danvers after getting an anomaly alert from sector MB-814. He asks Carol to check things out. Carol flies to MB-814 and finds an open jump point with a strange hue. She walks towards it and touches the swirling light.<br/><br/>Monica Rambeau notices a strange glow around the earth's atmosphere as she works on the satellite. Monica floats to the atmosphere to get a better look. She activates her powers and sees a new light spectrum. She reaches out to touch it, and it wraps around her fingers.<br/><br/>Kamala Khan can't focus on her homework because her head is in the clouds. She writes Captain Marvel fan fiction and dreams of meeting her hero. Then, she sees her bangle glowing. She reaches to touch it. Carol ends up in Kamala's place, Kamala switches with Monica, and Monica ends up on MB-814. Dar-Benn's disruption of the jump points caused a quantum entanglement. It's better to stay together until they can stabilize their swaps.<br/><br/>Kamala joins Carol and Monica on Carol's ship. Dar-Benn's first target is Tarnax, a Skrull refugee colony. Dar-Benn plans to create a jump point that's large enough to steal Tarnax's atmosphere for Hala and reestablish their air supply. Kamala, Carol, and Monica get to Tarnax but can't stop Dar-Benn. Carol admits that she is The Annihilator, and Dar-Benn will destroy every place Carol calls home to save Hala and get revenge. Can The Marvels stop her before Dar-Benn ends two more planets?<br/><br/>This film is a pure superhero team-up movie. If that plot bores you, then this film isn't for you. Monica and Carol have unfinished business from her childhood. Kamala learns that being a superhero requires making difficult decisions and sacrifices. When Carol gets heavy-handed with Kamala, Monica ensures they take a breath and listen to each other. It helps to watch Captain Marvel, Avengers: Infinity Wars, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel.<br/><br/>This movie has wall-to-wall action with poignant and funny moments to break up the script. Kamala's family, Goose, and Nick Fury will never fail to deliver. However, this movie heavily focuses on the action to drive the story. It's an enjoyable movie with Flerkens, fighting, dancing, and a princess that delivers what you expect with a few future nuggets.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Asha is a few months shy of her 18th birthday and gives tours of her homeland, Rosas. Rosas is famous. King Magnifico learned sorcery after wicked rulers destroyed his home. Then, he created Rosas and invited anyone to come. He uses his power to grant one wish every month in a ceremony. On a person's 18th birthday, the king asks for their wish. The person gives it to him and never remembers it. Today is the 100th birthday of Asha's grandfather, Sabino. Everyone thinks Magnifico will grant his wish in the ceremony.<br/><br/>Asha finishes another tour and runs to her friends for encouragement. She has an interview to be the king's apprentice. Queen Amaya enters the kitchen and asks Asha to speak to the king. He lets her enter the room of wishes. Asha looks at everyone's wishes in wonder and finds Sabino's. He wished to inspire people with music. Asha asks Magnifico if Magnifico will allow Sabino's wish, and Magnifico says no. He doesn't know if Sabino will motivate people to love Magnifico or overthrow him. Since Sabino's wish is too vague, he won't grant it. Asha tells Magnifico to return the wish if he won't allow it because remembering it will give Sabino hope. Magnifico refuses. He rejects Asha's application for the apprenticeship.<br/><br/>Asha tries to warn Sabino and her mother, Sakina, about Magnifico, but they don't want to hear it. Asha runs to her father's favorite spot and makes a wish upon a star. A bright light comes from the sky, and all of Rosas, including Magnifico, feels it. A star comes from the sky and gives Asha's goat, Valentino, the ability to talk. Asha decides to break into Magnifico's castle and free the wishes. Magnifico believes the unknown magic is a threat to his kingdom. And he will seek and destroy it no matter what.<br/><br/>The animation and songs are second to none in this film. King Magnifico is the classic Disney villain. Also, the film makes nods to Little Jon, Bambi, Thumper, and more beloved Disney characters. The trailer is tricky because it makes viewers think Asha wants Magnifico to grant their wishes. However, she wants Magnifico to return the wishes he won't allow to restore hope, imagination, and invention to the people. This film isn't saying to grant all wishes. It's saying wishes inspire hope, so you shouldn't forget them. That's the message for kids.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Then, Bea calls her sister, Halle. Bea gushes over the romantic meeting but questions why she left early. Bea returns to explain her actions but overhears Ben talking to his friend, Pete. Ben says Bea is a mess and nothing to him. Bea leaves in tears without talking to Ben.<br/><br/>Six months later, Bea attends a party with Halle and Halle's girlfriend, Claudia. Claudia calls over her brother, Pete, and Pete's friend, Ben, to meet Halle. Then, Halle calls over Bea to meet Ben, and they instantly argue. Bea proudly shows off the engagement ring her fiancé, Jonathan, gave her. Their friends and family retreat as the two continue to fight.<br/><br/>Later, Halle and Claudia send their friends and family invitations to their Australian wedding. Bea and Ben see each other on the plane. Ben confronts Bea on breaking up with Jonathan and wants to know why. Bea refuses to answer. They land, and Pete meets them with startling news. Halle and Claudia want the wedding party to stay in the same house, including Bea and Ben. At the beach, Ben runs into the one who got away, Margaret, and her handsome boyfriend, Beau.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Ben and Bea's interactions to become combustible. So, Claudia, her family, and Halle plan to make Bea and Ben fall in love. However, Bea's parents feel that Bea's life is falling off track and that she is better with Jonathan. So, they used their frequent flyer miles to fly him to Australia to win Bea back. Bea and Ben quickly figure out Claudia and her family's plan. So, they decide to date to make their family happy, make Margaret jealous, and make Jonathan stop pursuing Bea. What can go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie brings the comedy to this rom-com. The couple has great chemistry and match wits. Their first interaction is a laugh riot that sets the tone of this film. The script isn't afraid to be raunchy and awkward. Viewers should keep their eyes open for words of wisdom written on the walls, sand, and signs. This film is for Bridesmaids fans who need a good romp and warm-hearted love.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

He thinks it's the best chocolate in the world, but his mother says the best chocolate is at the Galeries Gourmet. Willy wishes they could open a shop there and sell his mother's chocolates.<br/><br/>Willy sails into town with his travel chocolate factory, tattered clothes, 12 silver sovereigns, and dream of owning a chocolate store in Galeries Gourmet. It doesn't take long for Willy to spend and lose all his money. Then, Bleacher approaches to pull his dog away from Willy. He knows a place Willy can stay that's affordable. Mrs. Scrubitt owns a laundry and boarding house. She will let Willy stay one night if he pays one silver sovereign by 6 pm tomorrow. A girl pops out of the backroom and warns Willy to read the fine print. Willy writes his name on the dotted line.<br/><br/>Willy travels to the Galeries Gourmet and introduces his hover chocolates to the crowd for one silver sovereign. Before anyone can try a piece, chocolatiers Authur Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelguber slink to Willy and grab a candy. They hate it because they believe chocolate should be simple and for the rich. Slugworth calls the Chief of Police to remove Willy for selling chocolate without a store. The Chief of Police takes Willy's earnings and escorts him out of the market.<br/><br/>Willy returns to Mrs. Scrubitt to pay his tab because he has one silver sovereign left. However, his current bill is 10,000 silver sovereign. Willy admits he can't pay it. So, he will have to work it off. Willy meets Mrs. Scrubitt's indentured servants - accountant Abacus, plumber Piper, comedian Larry, telephone operator Lottie, and the little girl Noodle.<br/><br/>After a day of scrubbing, Noddles takes Willy to his sleeping quarters. Willy wants to leave to sell his chocolates but can't figure out how. She gives him an idea. Willy believes he will have the money to pay Mrs. Scrubitt and buy a shop soon. However, Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelguber, also known as the Chocolate Cartel, conspire against Willy. Willy will need more than his dream and friends to survive. He will need an Oompa-Loompa.<br/><br/>Inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this musical prequel is a delight for the eyes and ears. The vibrant colors are for the most massive screen possible, and the music will spark your imagination. The plot provides long-time fans with Willy's background and pays homage to the original story. This musical is hilarious with a humous seduction, a thieving Oompa-Loompa, and a growing Chief of Police. Along the way, Willy makes fruitful and loving connections. And don't leave immediately, because Lofty will update the audience on everyone's whereabouts. This film is worth its weight in chocolate.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Celie and her sister, Nettie, reminisce about their mother when Celie's water breaks. Celie gives birth to a baby boy and names him Adam. Then, her father, Alfonso, enters to give the baby to God. Celie begs for more time with him, but her father says no. It's his baby, and he can do what he pleases.<br/><br/>Nettie walks home from school, and Mister follows her on a horse while serenading her. She tells him to leave her alone. Mister follows Nettie home and asks Alfonso for her hand in marriage. Alfonso says no. However, Celie means nothing to him, but she can work. As the men barter, Nettie and Celie watch. Alfonso tells Celie to pack her bags because she will marry Mister.<br/><br/>Celie, on foot, follows Mister on horseback to his home. He introduces her to his kids and tells her to start cleaning. Celine prepares dinner, and Mister demands to know why she didn't bathe the kids. She suggests doing it in the morning, and he slaps her to the floor. Late at night, Celie lays in bed and sees a picture of Shug Avery. Mister admits that's the woman he should've married. As Mister climbs on Celie, Celie stares at Shug's picture and dreams about her.<br/><br/>A few days later, Celie hears a knock at the door. It's Nettie. Alfonso started touching her, so she ran away. Celie begs Mister to let Nettie stay. He says yes. Everything seems to be going well until Mister creeps into Nettie's room. She pleads with him to stop and fights him when Mister resists. He grabs his gun and drags her outside. He threatens to shoot Nettie if she ever returns. When Celie tries to leave, Mister pulls her back and refuses to let Celie go. Nettie promises to write Celie once a week to let Celie know she is alive. But the letters never come, and Celie falls deeper into a loveless marriage of abuse. What will it take for Celie to discover a way to love herself and triumph over her dire circumstances?<br/><br/>Based on The Color Purple: A New Musical, this movie doesn't change the story. It only adds music to the plot. Now, the writers shorten the beginning between Nettie and Celie talking about a man doing his business. Also, the writers removed most of the internal monologue. The movie passes the torch between the original Celie and the current. Also, the sets change from a practical set to a stage setting without taking the audience out of the moment. The vocal performances are second to none, with perfect comedic timing. Be ready to sing, dance, cry, and stand taller after seeing this gem come to life on the silver screen.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1936, Joe Rantz attended the University of Washington for engineering. He needs to pay for the 2nd half of this semester in two weeks. After engineering class, Joe's friend, Roger, tells him the rowing team will pay crew members and offer housing. Coach Al Ulbrickson introduces the men to the other coaches, including Coach Thomas Bolles and the boatbuilder George Pocock. The coaches will decide who will join the varsity and junior varsity 8-men teams.<br/><br/>After a grueling tryout, Al picks Joe, Roger, and the other men. The president says they need to win, and he can ask the former students for more money. But winning one race isn't enough. They need to win gold at the Olympics. After the JV team races in the regatta and beat the best time ever by seconds, Al gets an unorthodox idea. Instead of sending the varsity team to compete in Poughkeepsie, he can send JV. The president, donors, and varsity team angrily erupt after Al's announcement. However, he won't budge. Can the JV team prove Al right by making it to the Olympics and winning gold?<br/><br/>Based on The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics by Daniel James Brown, this film focuses on Al, Joe, and their obstacles. Al went with his gut and made an unpopular choice. And he suffered along the way for it. Each time the team hit a new impossible milestone, someone moved the goalpost. Joe raised himself since he was 14. He has to learn how to depend on others and become one. This movie will make you cheer in your seat, but you won't have the urge to delve deeper into this historic win.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mack and Pam Mallard swim in their pond with their ducklings, Gwen and Dax. Mack tells the ducklings that life beyond the pond is dangerous and filled with duck-eating herons. Pam sees another flock fly above in a migration formation, and they land in their pond. Mack looks for his kids and sees Dax talking to a duck in the other flock named Kim. Kim tells Dax that her family will fly to Jamaica for the winter and see water that glows. A smitten Dax wants to go, but Mack says no. The flock flies away, and Pam and Mack put their kids to bed.<br/><br/>Mack accidentally sits on his Uncle Dan. Dan agrees with Mack to stay in the pond's safety. Dan says Mack can be secure and die alone like him. Mack quickly changes his mind and wakes up Pam. He wants to migrate to Jamaica, and everyone jumps for joy. They do their manual checks and fly south. However, they notice other flocks moving in the other direction. Mack and Pam decide to stay on their path. Adventure awaits.<br/><br/>This movie is charming and well-executed. The graphics are flawless as the Mallards fly through the sky from the pond to New York. If you get motion sickness, don't see this film in 3D. Unlike most Illumination movies, the script doesn't introduce the audience to the antagonist until the halfway mark. The Mallards open their eyes to a new world, new adventures, and new problems, but they hold solid as a family. This movie is a G version of the National Lampoon vacation films. And come early to see the Minions-Vector short.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jack Von Erich exits the arena after a grueling match to find his wife, Doris, and two sons waiting for him outside. Doris asks Jack how much the new Cadillac attached to their mobile home costs. Jack tells Doris he has to look like the NWA champion to get the belt. Doris prays for guidance in the front seat. Doris believes God will protect the family from the Von Erich Curse, but Jack thinks it's professional wrestling.<br/><br/>Years later, Jack runs WCCW promotion with his son, Kevin, at the top of the card. Jack and Doris's other sons, Kerry, Mike, and David, beam with pride at Kevin's in-ring accomplishments. Jack lets his sons know he has favorites in a particular order, but they are subject to change. Kerry is gearing up for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, and Kevin will wrestle Harley Race in a non-title match. Jack announces it's David's time to get into the squared circle and tag with Kevin.<br/><br/>Kerry returns home after the U.S. pulls out of the Olympics. Jack adds Kerry to the family business and makes Kevin, Kerry, and David compete in 6-man tag team matches. After the Von Erichs battle, Jack announces that David will go for the NWA championship. Kevin knows he has gone down a rank on Jack's list. The Von Erichs will fight to be at the top of Jack's list and the wrestling world while fighting the family curse.<br/><br/>This movie is a stunning tribute to the Von Erichs by bringing their story to a peaceful end. The casting was top-notch, and the actors embodied their roles. You can sense the deep love these brothers had for one another. The director overlays the brothers in the locker room, and viewers see their similar struggles and suffering. It's unbelievable that one family went through so much tragedy. This movie deserves to be seen on the big screen because it is honest perfection.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
