    "review":"Jack Von Erich exits the arena after a grueling match to find his wife, Doris, and two sons waiting for him outside. Doris asks Jack how much the new Cadillac attached to their mobile home costs. Jack tells Doris he has to look like the NWA champion to get the belt. Doris prays for guidance in the front seat. Doris believes God will protect the family from the Von Erich Curse, but Jack thinks it's professional wrestling.<br/><br/>Years later, Jack runs WCCW promotion with his son, Kevin, at the top of the card. Jack and Doris's other sons, Kerry, Mike, and David, beam with pride at Kevin's in-ring accomplishments. Jack lets his sons know he has favorites in a particular order, but they are subject to change. Kerry is gearing up for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, and Kevin will wrestle Harley Race in a non-title match. Jack announces it's David's time to get into the squared circle and tag with Kevin.<br/><br/>Kerry returns home after the U.S. pulls out of the Olympics. Jack adds Kerry to the family business and makes Kevin, Kerry, and David compete in 6-man tag team matches. After the Von Erichs battle, Jack announces that David will go for the NWA championship. Kevin knows he has gone down a rank on Jack's list. The Von Erichs will fight to be at the top of Jack's list and the wrestling world while fighting the family curse.<br/><br/>This movie is a stunning tribute to the Von Erichs by bringing their story to a peaceful end. The casting was top-notch, and the actors embodied their roles. You can sense the deep love these brothers had for one another. The director overlays the brothers in the locker room, and viewers see their similar struggles and suffering. It's unbelievable that one family went through so much tragedy. This movie deserves to be seen on the big screen because it is honest perfection.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Celie and her sister, Nettie, reminisce about their mother when Celie's water breaks. Celie gives birth to a baby boy and names him Adam. Then, her father, Alfonso, enters to give the baby to God. Celie begs for more time with him, but her father says no. It's his baby, and he can do what he pleases.<br/><br/>Nettie walks home from school, and Mister follows her on a horse while serenading her. She tells him to leave her alone. Mister follows Nettie home and asks Alfonso for her hand in marriage. Alfonso says no. However, Celie means nothing to him, but she can work. As the men barter, Nettie and Celie watch. Alfonso tells Celie to pack her bags because she will marry Mister.<br/><br/>Celie, on foot, follows Mister on horseback to his home. He introduces her to his kids and tells her to start cleaning. Celine prepares dinner, and Mister demands to know why she didn't bathe the kids. She suggests doing it in the morning, and he slaps her to the floor. Late at night, Celie lays in bed and sees a picture of Shug Avery. Mister admits that's the woman he should've married. As Mister climbs on Celie, Celie stares at Shug's picture and dreams about her.<br/><br/>A few days later, Celie hears a knock at the door. It's Nettie. Alfonso started touching her, so she ran away. Celie begs Mister to let Nettie stay. He says yes. Everything seems to be going well until Mister creeps into Nettie's room. She pleads with him to stop and fights him when Mister resists. He grabs his gun and drags her outside. He threatens to shoot Nettie if she ever returns. When Celie tries to leave, Mister pulls her back and refuses to let Celie go. Nettie promises to write Celie once a week to let Celie know she is alive. But the letters never come, and Celie falls deeper into a loveless marriage of abuse. What will it take for Celie to discover a way to love herself and triumph over her dire circumstances?<br/><br/>Based on The Color Purple: A New Musical, this movie doesn't change the story. It only adds music to the plot. Now, the writers shorten the beginning between Nettie and Celie talking about a man doing his business. Also, the writers removed most of the internal monologue. The movie passes the torch between the original Celie and the current. Also, the sets change from a practical set to a stage setting without taking the audience out of the moment. The vocal performances are second to none, with perfect comedic timing. Be ready to sing, dance, cry, and stand taller after seeing this gem come to life on the silver screen.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

He pretends Bea is his wife and orders a drink for her. They enjoy the day together, go to his house, and spend the night together.<br/><br/>Bea wakes up before Ben and slinks out of his house. Then, Bea calls her sister, Halle. Bea gushes over the romantic meeting but questions why she left early. Bea returns to explain her actions but overhears Ben talking to his friend, Pete. Ben says Bea is a mess and nothing to him. Bea leaves in tears without talking to Ben.<br/><br/>Six months later, Bea attends a party with Halle and Halle's girlfriend, Claudia. Claudia calls over her brother, Pete, and Pete's friend, Ben, to meet Halle. Then, Halle calls over Bea to meet Ben, and they instantly argue. Bea proudly shows off the engagement ring her fiancé, Jonathan, gave her. Their friends and family retreat as the two continue to fight.<br/><br/>Later, Halle and Claudia send their friends and family invitations to their Australian wedding. Bea and Ben see each other on the plane. Ben confronts Bea on breaking up with Jonathan and wants to know why. Bea refuses to answer. They land, and Pete meets them with startling news. Halle and Claudia want the wedding party to stay in the same house, including Bea and Ben. At the beach, Ben runs into the one who got away, Margaret, and her handsome boyfriend, Beau.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Ben and Bea's interactions to become combustible. So, Claudia, her family, and Halle plan to make Bea and Ben fall in love. However, Bea's parents feel that Bea's life is falling off track and that she is better with Jonathan. So, they used their frequent flyer miles to fly him to Australia to win Bea back. Bea and Ben quickly figure out Claudia and her family's plan. So, they decide to date to make their family happy, make Margaret jealous, and make Jonathan stop pursuing Bea. What can go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie brings the comedy to this rom-com. The couple has great chemistry and match wits. Their first interaction is a laugh riot that sets the tone of this film. The script isn't afraid to be raunchy and awkward. Viewers should keep their eyes open for words of wisdom written on the walls, sand, and signs. This film is for Bridesmaids fans who need a good romp and warm-hearted love.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Asha is a few months shy of her 18th birthday and gives tours of her homeland, Rosas. Rosas is famous. King Magnifico learned sorcery after wicked rulers destroyed his home. Then, he created Rosas and invited anyone to come. He uses his power to grant one wish every month in a ceremony. On a person's 18th birthday, the king asks for their wish. The person gives it to him and never remembers it. Today is the 100th birthday of Asha's grandfather, Sabino. Everyone thinks Magnifico will grant his wish in the ceremony.<br/><br/>Asha finishes another tour and runs to her friends for encouragement. She has an interview to be the king's apprentice. Queen Amaya enters the kitchen and asks Asha to speak to the king. He lets her enter the room of wishes. Asha looks at everyone's wishes in wonder and finds Sabino's. He wished to inspire people with music. Asha asks Magnifico if Magnifico will allow Sabino's wish, and Magnifico says no. He doesn't know if Sabino will motivate people to love Magnifico or overthrow him. Since Sabino's wish is too vague, he won't grant it. Asha tells Magnifico to return the wish if he won't allow it because remembering it will give Sabino hope. Magnifico refuses. He rejects Asha's application for the apprenticeship.<br/><br/>Asha tries to warn Sabino and her mother, Sakina, about Magnifico, but they don't want to hear it. Asha runs to her father's favorite spot and makes a wish upon a star. A bright light comes from the sky, and all of Rosas, including Magnifico, feels it. A star comes from the sky and gives Asha's goat, Valentino, the ability to talk. Asha decides to break into Magnifico's castle and free the wishes. Magnifico believes the unknown magic is a threat to his kingdom. And he will seek and destroy it no matter what.<br/><br/>The animation and songs are second to none in this film. King Magnifico is the classic Disney villain. Also, the film makes nods to Little Jon, Bambi, Thumper, and more beloved Disney characters. The trailer is tricky because it makes viewers think Asha wants Magnifico to grant their wishes. However, she wants Magnifico to return the wishes he won't allow to restore hope, imagination, and invention to the people. This film isn't saying to grant all wishes. It's saying wishes inspire hope, so you shouldn't forget them. That's the message for kids.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George de Bologne Saint-Georges took his illegitimate son, Joseph, from Joseph's enslaved mother, Nanon, and brought Joseph to a Jesuit boarding school in Angoulême. Joseph, age 7, stood up and started to play his violin. The headmaster accepted Joseph into the school, and George left him there.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, Joseph battled Alexandre Picard, a fencing master, after Alexandre made derogatory comments about Joseph's mulatto background. Joseph beat Alexandre with a publicly divided audience watching. Queen Marie Antoinette stood up and named Joseph an officer of the king's bodyguard and a chevalier.<br/><br/>During a party, Joseph relays his ambitions to the queen. He wants to be the director of the Paris Opera. Singer Marie-Madeleine Guimard overhears Joseph's ambition and pulls him aside for a dance. She can put Joseph in their favor if he sleeps with her. Joseph turns down her advances, and Marie-Josephine's singing voice pulls him away. Joseph and Marie-Josephine, the wife of Marc René, talk about her voice, the opera, and his talents. Her cousin, Madam de Genlis, pulls Marie-Josephine away to make connections.<br/><br/>Later, Joseph meets with Madam de Genlis to produce his opera, but she's unsure he can pull it off. Joseph agrees to do it, but he wants Marie-Josephine to be the singer. Marie-Josephine comes to the opera house and decides to sing because Marc-René will be away for a year. Joseph is a man with the world at his feet and talent in a bow. However, Ancien Régime will take it all away because he is not one of them, merely a tourist.<br/><br/>This piece of reclaimed history has something for everyone. It starts with drama at the opera after Joseph interrupts Mozart as Mozart takes audience requests. This prelude to the revolution has bold music, stunning costumes, and meticulous detail to social etiquette. Viewers will watch Joseph navigate a tightrope of customs and rituals in French society. By pushing Joseph out, they make him a spear in the revolution. If you are not an opera fan, this film has something for you too. And the conclusion explains how Joseph's history faded away until now.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

After engineering class, Joe's friend, Roger, tells him the rowing team will pay crew members and offer housing. Coach Al Ulbrickson introduces the men to the other coaches, including Coach Thomas Bolles and the boatbuilder George Pocock. The coaches will decide who will join the varsity and junior varsity 8-men teams.<br/><br/>After a grueling tryout, Al picks Joe, Roger, and the other men. The president says they need to win, and he can ask the former students for more money. But winning one race isn't enough. They need to win gold at the Olympics. After the JV team races in the regatta and beat the best time ever by seconds, Al gets an unorthodox idea. Instead of sending the varsity team to compete in Poughkeepsie, he can send JV. The president, donors, and varsity team angrily erupt after Al's announcement. However, he won't budge. Can the JV team prove Al right by making it to the Olympics and winning gold?<br/><br/>Based on The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics by Daniel James Brown, this film focuses on Al, Joe, and their obstacles. Al went with his gut and made an unpopular choice. And he suffered along the way for it. Each time the team hit a new impossible milestone, someone moved the goalpost. Joe raised himself since he was 14. He has to learn how to depend on others and become one.

Monk hasn't sold a novel in years, and several publishers turned down his latest manuscript. Another publisher turned down Monk's work because it wasn't 'black enough.' Monk thinks that's ridiculous. Monk returns to Boston and attends a book festival, but the crowd is thin. Another author explains that everyone is at the session for Sinatra Golden. Monk quietly enters her session and becomes sickened by her book, 'We's Lives in Da Ghetto.' He thinks her book appeals to the lowest demographic and panders to stereotypes. Later, Monk visits his sister, OB GYN Dr. Lisa, at work, and she drives him to their mother's home. They enjoy a night out with Agnes.<br/><br/>Monk and Lisa meet for lunch, and she warns him that Agnes's health is declining. Monk asks if their brother, Plastic Surgeon Dr. Cliff, will help, but he is in dire straits emotionally and financially since his divorce. Then, the unimaginable happens. Now, Monk has to come up with the money to care for Agnes. So, he sits and writes a book called 'My Pafology' with all the racial stereotypes and sends it to Arthur under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh.<br/><br/>Monk gets a phone call from a gleeful Arthur in the morning. A publishing company offered Monk $750,000 for his book. Monk can't believe it and rejects the offer because the book goes against everything he believes. Arthur reminds Monk Agnes needs help. Monk staggers to yes. Monk thinks this deal is one-and-done. However, Leigh's rise could trigger Monk's downfall.<br/><br/>Based on Erasure by Percival Everett, this movie bravely acknowledges issues in literature while defending it. Companies love to shine a light on black voices but only tell the stories of violence and slavery. However, companies shouldn't ignore or overlook these stories either. This plot gives the viewer a glimpse into the writer's process and multiple endings. Also, this movie makes the most uncomfortable moments hilarious. Don't let preconceived notions stop you from seeing this film. It's for everyone. So, do you believe Monk is a sell-out, or does the ends justify the means?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Jessica says yes and goes through the deadly ritual but doesn't tell them she's pregnant. With her new status, Jessica will convince non-believing Freman that Paul is the Messiah.<br/><br/>Paul desires to learn the ways of the Freman. Stilgar gladly teaches Paul, and southern Freman delights in Paul's triumphs. However, a northern Freman, Chani, isn't impressed. She doesn't subscribe to the prophecy because she thinks it's an enslavement tool. Paul confides in Chani about his apocalyptic dreams as the two become inseparable.

Vladimir thinks Glossu is a doting foot soldier but doesn't believe Glossu is ready to lead. Vladimir wants his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha, to take the throne. Emperor Shaddam IV's Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam, agrees. Shaddam's daughter, Princess Irulan, disagrees because Feyd-Rautha is a psychopath. Irulan keeps a secret. She suspects that Paul and Jessica are alive but unsure of their location. Can Paul and the Fremans stop the Harroken with the Emperor and his people secretly working for them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Dune by Frank Herbert and the sequel to Dune, this film deserves the most vivid screen and best sound an audience can find. The graphics are extraordinary and clean. The sound gives the script a proper build for its iconic moments. The story is captivating and dramatic. The script doesn't force its high-level wit on you and profoundly uses silence. On this surface, this movie is about empires fighting over a resource. However, this plot gently discusses religion and looting. This sequel is better than the first film and deserves your time and money. Its stunning fight scenes, jaw-dropping graphics, and compelling storyline are worth the running time.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

He wants to bring everyone peacefully together.<br/><br/>Bob plays with his friends and family and travels to practice before the concert. Bob's wife, Rita, sings background vocals but leaves to take care of things before the show. Rita sees several men approaching the house with guns. Before she can warn Bob and the band, a man shoots her in the head. The men run inside and shoot anyone moving. Bob and Rita survive their wounds and perform the concert two days later. He tells Rita to take the children and stay with Rita's mother in America while he records his next album in London.

After financial disputes, domestic issues, and health problems, Bob will discover that delivering the message isn't enough. He has to become the message.<br/><br/>This film only covers a few years of Marley's life in detail. The documentary doesn't try to glamorize Bob or paint him as a hero.

    "mtitle":"Cabrini",
    "review":"Mother Frances Cabrini receives an invitation to visit the cardinal in Vatican City. She wrote the Pope several times to start a mission to help orphans globally. She feels that the Vatican ignores the East. So, Mother Cabrini wants to begin in China and work her way West. She wants to create an Empire of Hope. She refuses the cardinal's rejection and demands to speak to the Pope. The Pope listens to Mother Cabrini's passionate plea and accepts her mission but with a condition. Italian immigrants living in New York's Five Points witness children freezing to death in the streets while Americans ignore their plight. The Pope will allow Mother Cabrini's mission if she starts in New York. Mother Cabrini returns and tells her fellow Sisters to pack. They migrate to New York. Cabrini, sick with lung disease, will face prejudice, corruption, and sexism to save children around the world.<br/><br/>This nun doesn't sit idly by and accept rejection. She learns to navigate the world of politics and media to sway the opinions of the American people. She gains allies from all walks of life to advance her efforts. Mother Cabrini's drive comes from a short life expectancy. She doesn't have time to accept no. This woman wasn't afraid to be loud, towering, and visible.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire",
    "review":"After capturing the Hell's Kitchen's Dragon Ghost, the Ghostbusters - Gary, Callie, Trevor, and Phoebe - meet with Mayor Walter Peck. Mayor Peck threatens to charge Gary and Callie with child labor crimes if they don't bench Phoebe. They return home to extract the ghost from the trap, but the containment unit takes a while to go green. Gary and Phoebe start to worry if the containment unit has enough room.<br/><br/>Nadeem enters Dr. Ray Stantz's store with several of his grandmother's items, looking for a quick buck. At first, nothing catches Ray's eye until he picks up a bronze orb covered in ancient glyphs. Ray scans it with a PKE meter, and it violently vibrates. The orb causes the wall around the containment unit to crack. Dr. Winston takes them to his secret lab. He has a containment unit several times larger than the one in the Ghostbuster's basement. Intern Lucky and Lars try to extract the ghost from the orb, but it protects itself with a layer of freezing ice.<br/><br/>They take the orb to a linguistic specialist, Dr. Hurbert Wartzki. He recognizes it from wall carvings in ancient tombs. It houses a ghostly deity, Garraka, who worked alongside a king to expand the king's empire. Garraka rose and started to freeze the world around him. A group known as the Fire Masters trapped Garraka in the bronze orb to protect the world from his wrath. The Ghostbusters must find a fire master to trap and destroy Garraka for good. If not, Garraka will raise a ghost army, bring forth the second ice age, and end humankind.<br/><br/>This sequel starts with a Robert Frost poem and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. It has jokes for older and newer fans of the franchise. While the script packs action in most scenes, the encompassing theme is family. The elder team reunites to help save the world. The current Ghostbusters are finding their groove as a blended family. Also, the Spengler kids are asserting their independence. Parents should be careful. The plot mentions a sex dungeon and hookers once. Also, it has one mid-credit scene. This film is intriguing, suspenseful, heartfelt, and funny.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
