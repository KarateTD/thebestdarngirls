    "mtitle": "Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot",
    "review": "First Lady Donna Martin is happy with her family in the small town of Possum Trot. Her husband, Reverand W.C. Martin, leads the Bennett Baptist Church. They have two children, Ladonna and Princeton. However, Donna's mother, Murtha, wants Donna and W.C. to have more children. Murtha, the mother of 18, returns home and dies. Donna falls into a depression for months. After arguing with W.C., Donna leaves the house and travels to the ruins of her childhood home. There, she sees a group of children playing and hears God speak to her. Donna calls her sister, Diann, and asks Diann to attend an adoption seminar.<br/><br/>Social worker Susan explains that 70% of the children suffer from poverty-induced neglect. The other 30% suffered severe abuse. She shows Diann and Donna images of the other 30%, and the pictures call both to act.<br/><br/>A brother and sister come to Susan's office with heartbreaking stories. Susan exhausts all her options. Donna jumps at the chance to help and welcomes them into her home. W.C. preaches to their congregation about their adoption, the excuses not to adopt, and the bible's most notable adoption. It inspires 22 families to adopt. However, the people can't afford to come to Susan for the classes. They ask Susan to host it in their church. This small town will make a lasting imprint on the children, Texas, and the system, but it won't be easy.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't make adoption look effortless. However, the families in Possum Trot never give up. The writers don't depict adoption as a magic bullet to fix these children's long-term hardships. It's the first step of many. When W.C. and Donna see the town falling apart and second-guessing their choice, they lean on each other with group prayer and outreach. They recap the children and townspeople today at the conclusion before asking the audience to help. It will assist viewers make an informed choice about adoption. But hopefully, it will spark a passion for others to follow Possum Trot's lead.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadpool and Wolverine",
    "review": "Wade Wilson wanted more from his life because Vanessa asked him to cut out the nonsense. He uses Cable's time-traveling device to join a superhero team, but they reject him. Wade returns to his timeline and sells cars with Peter for 6 years. Deadpool is a thing of the past. Wade bikes home and finds a surprise birthday party waiting for him. He answers a knock at the door and assumes the uniformed people are strippers. They are the Time Variant Authority or TVA. They rip the wig off Wade's head and pull him into a portal.<br/><br/>Wade wakes up at a table with Mr. Paradox at the opposite end. Mr. Paradox introduces Wade to the TVA and the Sacred Timeline. Mr. Paradox warns Wade that his timeline will end because an 'anchor being' died. He grows tired of waiting for the timelines to parish. Mr. Paradox is building a Time Ripper to destroy Wade's timeline but will allow Wade to move to another and spare his life. Wade assumes he's the anchor being, and Mr. Paradox laughs. Wade's timeline's anchor is Wolverine. Wade can't stomach the thought of losing his friends. He steals Mr. Paradox's TemPad and jumps through timelines to find a replacement Wolverine.<br/><br/>Wade returns with a suitable Logan and demands Mr. Paradox return them to his timeline. Mr. Paradox laughs because this version of Logan ended his universe. Mr. Paradox sends them to the Void. He expects Cassandra Nova and Alioth to finish the job. Wade and Logan must put their issues aside to leave the Void, stop Mr. Paradox from using the Time Ripper, and save Wade's timeline.<br/><br/>This movie reaches across universes and production studios to fulfill every fan's fantasy. The opening sequence starts with blood, guts, violation, and NSync. Then, Wade travels through the timeline and finds a host of Wolverines. They will surprise and humor you. The team-up in the Void is legendary and finishes several characters' stories while staying true to Deadpool. The graphics hold hidden gems amongst the gore and make your stomach churn with Cassandra's powers. The music covers all genres and is perfectly inappropriate. This film will surpass your expectations and remind you why you love this franchise. See this before anyone spoils the surprises. Also, there are post- and mid-credit scenes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She feels that the Vatican ignores the East. So, Mother Cabrini wants to begin in China and work her way West. She wants to create an Empire of Hope. She refuses the cardinal's rejection and demands to speak to the Pope. The Pope listens to Mother Cabrini's passionate plea and accepts her mission but with a condition. Italian immigrants living in New York's Five Points witness children freezing to death in the streets while Americans ignore their plight. The Pope will allow Mother Cabrini's mission if she starts in New York. Mother Cabrini returns and tells her fellow Sisters to pack. They migrate to New York. Cabrini, sick with lung disease, will face prejudice, corruption, and sexism to save children around the world.<br/><br/>This nun doesn't sit idly by and accept rejection. She learns to navigate the world of politics and media to sway the opinions of the American people. She gains allies from all walks of life to advance her efforts. Mother Cabrini's drive comes from a short life expectancy. She doesn't have time to accept no. This woman wasn't afraid to be loud, towering, and visible.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Marcus delivers a toast at a moment he thought would never happen: Mike's wedding. Marcus cries as he wishes Mike the best with his new bride, Christine. Marcus gets help from Captain Conrad's daughter, U.S. Marshall Judy, and granddaughter, Callie. Marcus dances the Wobble and suffers a heart attack. Captain Conrad assures Marcus that he won't die and gives Marcus a warning. Marcus wakes up with a new lease on life and is 100% fearless. As Marcus begs Mike to get him Skittles, Mike gets a news alert on his phone. The FBI found evidence that Captain Conrad was working with the drug cartels.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus run to headquarters to clear their captain's legacy, but Captain Rita and her boyfriend, Attorney General Lockwood, must follow the evidence. Judy enters and demands they find the real culprits. Mike offers to help, but she refuses because Mike's son, Armando, killed her dad.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus ride and contemplate their next steps when they get a video message from Conrad. He was looking into corruption after their ecstasy bust years ago. Now, he needs his Bad Boys to clear his name. He warns them to trust no one. Mike believes they must ask a cartel member to catch the corruption.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus visit Armando in prison. Armando states that Conrad was clean. Also, his mother, Isabel, didn't put Conrad on the list; someone added him. Mike and Marcus find Conrad's secret case files and pull Armando out of jail to go through them. They believe they have an advantage, but the culprit is one step ahead. To get through this, Mike and Marcus will need fate, AMMO, Reggie, and alligators.<br/><br/>For newcomers to the franchise, it helps to see the three previous films before watching this 4th installment. This chapter of the buddy-action-comedy will introduce a new version of Bad Boys, tie up loose ends, and show you another side of Reggie. Unlike the previous films, Mike is cautious and has panic attacks. However, Marcus is fearless and wild. Their switch, along with the action-packed fight scenes, make this movie entertaining. Be prepared to laugh, wince, and cheer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A human-made virus increased apes' intelligence and gave them the ability to speak, but it did the opposite for humans. One of the apes led them to prosperity. His name was Caesar, but he died many generations ago. Today, the Eagle Clan is a close-knit group that will celebrate the bonding ceremony at sunrise. Noa, urged by his mother, runs to his father, Koro, with his eagle egg. Koro is proud but smells a unique scent on Noa's blanket. Noa admits an Echo - their name for a human - took his blanket, but Noa retrieved it. Koro demands to know if Noa went into the valley. Noa truthfully says no.<br/><br/>Noa catches an odor coming from a tent and investigates. He finds a female Echo hiding inside and scares it away. The Echo charges past him and breaks his egg. He needs it for the ceremony. So, he travels into the forest to get a new one. He hears the Coastal Clan riding on their horses and hides. They see Noa's horse in the woods, shock it, and follow it to the Eagle Clan.<br/><br/>Noa hurries home to warn the others, but it's too late. Proximus, leader of the Coastal Clan, had his army attack the Eagle clan and take them prisoner. Noa wakes up in the morning. The Coastal Clan killed Koro and stole the Eagle Clan. Noa travels through the valley and vows to bring them back. Noa will learn the truth about Caesar, the Echos, and Proximus's greatest desire. Proximus is hunting the female Echo because she is the key to the evolution of his Kingdom of Apes.<br/><br/>This latest Planet of the Apes installment has mesmerizing graphics, heart-warming laughs, and a captivating storyline. The plot slows when Noa uncovers Promxius's plan and meets Raka. Don't get confused. This film occurs several generations after Caesar died. One thing Apes and Humans want is knowledge. It's the key to their survival, but can they coexist? This plot point is the movie's standout. Planet fans should keep their eyes and ears open for a few easter eggs. And there aren't any post-credit scenes, but the movie leaves room for another film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

As they wait in line to scan their tickets, Cooper notices officers with high-powered rifles.<br/><br/>They settle into their seats as Lady Raven performs for 20,000 people. Cooper spots police officers taking men out of the audience. Cooper enters the bathroom stall, pulls out his phone, and checks on Spencer. Spencer is the person Cooper chained in a basement. Cooper gleams as Spencer pulls his chains, cries, and begs for help.<br/><br/>During the intermission, Riley wants concert merchandise. The vendor, Jamie, loves Cooper's example. He offers to find another shirt later if Cooper returns in 10 minutes. Cooper pulls Jamie aside and asks why the arena has a vast police presence. Jamie whispers that the concert is a trap. The FBI discovered that 'The Butcher' would be there. The Butcher is a notorious serial killer who dismembered a dozen victims. They have SWAT covering every exit, FBI profiler Dr. Josephine Grant in The Butcher's head, and they will stop every man.<br/><br/>Cooper tests the security. He sees a drunken girl wobbling near a staircase. He bumps into her, and she falls. Arena security runs to her aid, but SWAT doesn't move. Cooper has to find a way out of the trap without tipping off Riley. Can he make it out?<br/><br/>This movie builds slowly for 15 minutes to allow the audience to see Cooper's bond with Riley and Riley's admiration for Lady Raven. Viewers will notice little quirks in Cooper's character before he sits with his daughter. It's not until Cooper looks at his phone that you understand the depths of his depravity. Cooper maneuvers around the arena with precision, finesse, and dumb luck. With this director, you expect a twist. However, there are several that will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you root for Cooper.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Since its disappearance, the Energon stopped flowing naturally, and Cybertronians are born without their transformation cog. Without the ability to transform, Energon miners, like Orion, dig below the surface to mine the resource. And their leader, Sentinel Prime, searches the surface for the Matrix. Security guards find Orion and chase him out of the archives. Orion jumps out of a window, and his best friend, D-16, saves him.<br/><br/>D-16 and Orion dig with their co-worker, Jazz, and captain, Elita-1. During their dig, an explosion traps Jazz, and Elita-1 tells Orion and D-16 to leave him and follow protocol. But Orion won't listen. He convinces D-16 to save Jazz. They do, but cause a cave-in. Then, Sentinel Prime makes an announcement. The miners will get the day off for Iacon 5000.<br/><br/>Orion and D-16 walk to the race, and Orion pulls D-16 into a secret entrance. D-16 grins at the starting line until Orion straps a jetpack to their backs. They enter the race and nearly win before losing miserably. However, Sentinel Prime congratulates them for motiving the mining bots. After Sentinel Prime and his second-in-command, Arachnid, leave, a racer furiously barges into the room. They caused him to crash, and he punishes them. He dumps them to level 50.<br/><br/>B-127 can't believe he has guests. Then, B-127 introduces them to his 'friends.' Orion accidentally knocks into B-127's 'friend,' and a chip falls out. It plays a message from Alpha Trion. He is in battle and gives their final location. Orion believes that's where they will find the Matrix. He convinces D-16 and B-127 to come to the surface to find the Matrix. They uncover so much more.<br/><br/>This origin story plays into the best friends becoming mortal enemies cliché but is highly entertaining and feels original. The story has jokes for parents without making sexual innuendos. The film has action and astounding storytelling. Also, they don't force a romantic storyline. This film is about the creation of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. There is one mid-credit scene and one post-credit scene. The graphics could be better, but the story makes up for the visual pitfalls. See this movie with the entire family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Lydia, Delia, Astrid, and Rory arrive at the original Ghost House in Winter River. They have a funeral for Charles, and Delia shrouds the house in black cloth for a grief collective. During the wake, Rory proposes to Lydia, and she reluctantly agrees. Astrid leaves in disgust, jumps on her bike, and narrowly escapes death by crashing through a fence and into a tree. A boy, Jeremy, sees her from his tree house and runs down to help. The two connect and make plans to meet before the wedding.<br/><br/>In the afterlife, Betelgeuse manages a call center. He gets a call from Ghost Detective Wolf Jackson because someone accidently reanimated Betelgeuse's ex-wife, Delores. Betelgeuse tells them he married Delores, thinking he found the love of his life. He didn't know she was a witch who traded immortality for taking people's lives. She poisoned Betelgeuse on their wedding night. Before the poison took effect, he killed her. Now she is traveling through the afterlife, sucking the souls out of anyone standing in between her and Betelgeuse. He believes marrying Lydia will save him from Delores.<br/><br/>Before the wedding, Astrid roams to the attic and finds the town model, a Betelgeuse flyer, and a photo album with pictures of Richard. She questions Lydia about the flyer and says Betelgeuse's name twice. Lydia pulls Astrid out of the attic and forbids her from going inside. Later, Lydia walks into the attic, and Rory finds her. He believes Betelgeuse is a figment of her imagination and says the name three times. Betelgeuse acts as their marriage counselor before Lydia and Rory escape. She relocates Betelgeuse to her past until Astrid gets in trouble and enters the afterlife. Lydia will say the three words that put fear in her heart. Will she regret it?<br/><br/>This sequel has callbacks from the first with songs, outfits, and art but tells a unique tale. Lydia kept her ability to talk to ghosts and now uses it to make a living. Delia moved beyond sculpture and now uses her body as a canvas. On the surface, the movie is about Lydia, Delia, and Astrid escaping Betelgeuse. However, it's about bringing Lydia and Astrid together because Astrid doesn't understand Lydia's love for her. Viewers will get a new possession song and dance while laughing with their favorite bio-exorcist. Also, the audience learns more about Betelgeuse before his death in a foreign-film-style retelling. They also get an animated version of Charles' death and the Soul Train. Fans of the original movie will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "ROZZUM Unit 7 1 3 4 is an assistance robot from Universal Dynamics. It activates on a remote, uninhabited island and looks for a task. The wildlife and terrain become a challenge. So, ROZZUM puts herself in observation mode for several days. She learns about the ecosystem and animal linguistics. When she is at 100%, ROZZUM turns on and looks for her owner to give her a task. ROZZUM enters a bear cave while searching. The bear, Thorn, wakes and chases ROZZUM. ROZZUM escapes by slipping and crushing a bird's nest. ROZZUM looks under herself and finds a dead goose and several broken eggs. Only one is intact. A fox, Fink, steals the egg to eat it, but ROZZUM stops him. ROZZUM sends a distress beacon so the manufacturers can locate her, but the gosling breaks it. An opossum, Pinktail, sees ROZZUM struggling with the tiny bird and explains that it thinks ROZZUM is its mother. ROZZUM leaves the gosling behind to find a task. Pinktail tells ROZZUM that her task is to get the gosling some food, teach it to swim, and teach it how to fly before winter. ROZZUM's programming activates, and she cares for the gosling.<br/><br/>ROZZUM crosses paths with Fink again while acquiring food for the gosling. Fink tells ROZZUM to give up because it's a runt and wasn't supposed to survive. However, ROZZUM refuses to accept this because it's her task. Later, Fink tells ROZZUM to name the young bird. She calls the gosling Brightbill and tells everyone to call her Roz. Over months, Roz, Fink, and Brightbill become a family, but Brightbill can't fly and is a weak swimmer. Brightbill finds other geese during a swimming lesson, but they exclude him because a 'monster' raised him. Roz feels guilty and ventures around the island. She finds several broken ROZZUMs in a cave. She disconnects its return beacon, steals it, and returns to Brightbill to complete her tasks. She must teach Brightbill to fly. After several attempts, an elder goose, Longneck, promises to take Brightbill under his wing for the migration. But Roz has to get Brightbill ready in a week. Can Roz and Fink get Brightbill prepared for the winter migration?<br/><br/>Based on The Wild Robot by Peter Brown, this movie gives a caring and unapologetic view of parenting. However, it offers it from a wildlife perspective. Fink wants her to give Brightbill his independence, but she wants him to be independent while closer to her. Roz excels beyond her programming when she experiences love. The audience should know that the movie goes beyond the migration. Roz's time with Brightbill helps her become a mother. However, something more makes her a wild robot. The storyline is compelling and unique. The voice actors deliver the lines with emotion and perfect comedic timing. And the graphics are astounding. Viewers should keep an ear open for the A-1 13 reference. The film is on a cliffhanger because it's book 1 of a series. Also, there is a short but funny post-credit scene.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Joker: Folie à Deux",
    "review": "The guards at Arkham Asylum give Arthur Fleck a clean shave and suit before he meets his lawyer, Maryanne Stewart. Maryanne prepares Arthur for a conference with his court-appointed psychologist. The psychologists believes Arthur has a split personality that he calls Joker after suffering years of abuse. If they can get the court to accept it, Arthur will spend his life in a mental facility instead of a prison for murdering five people. The guards lead Arthur to B-ward, and he hears singing. Arthur peeks inside and glances at a beautiful woman with an angelic voice. Arthur finishes his psychiatric evaluation, but Maryanne knows this strategy is a long shot. Arthur goes back to his cell. During yard time, a guard, Jackie, got Arthur some time in the B-ward's music class. Arthur can't contain his excitement.<br/><br/>Arthur sits next to the woman. She tells him her name is Lee. He inspired her. She grew up in the same building as him and had an abusive father. She watched Arthur on The Murray Franklin Show and wanted Arthur to shoot him. Then, he did. That's when Lee felt seen for the first time. The guards pull Arthur away, but he is smitten with Lee.<br/><br/>Arthur watches District Attorney Harvey Dent give a press conference about Arthur's trial. Judge Herman Rothwax deemed Arthur fit to stand trial. And Harvey wants Arthur to get the death penalty.<br/><br/>B-ward's music class watches a musical. Lee gets up, walks to the piano, sets it ablaze, and sits in her seat. When people spot the fire, they run. Lee grabs Arthur, and they flee in the other direction. The guards grab Arthur and throw him into the hole until his trial.<br/><br/>One day, Lee awakens Arthur. She bribed a guard to let her into the hole to say goodbye to Arthur. However, she plans to be at Arthur's trial daily. She paints Arthur's face, and they make love in the hole.<br/><br/>Arthur enters the courtroom but looks back at the door during the opening statement. He beams with glee when Lee enters and sits in the back. After the first day of deliberations, Lee confronts Maryanne in the vestibule. Lee thinks Maryanne is mocking the Joker and losing the trial. Lee says the world is on Joker's side and will free him.<br/><br/>Lee goes to the holding cell and tells Joker that Maryanne will lose the trial. Maryanne meets with Arthur about the trial. He professes his love for Lee, and Maryanne laughs. She reveals that Lee is a liar. Her name is Harley Quinzel, and her parents are rich. Arthur confronts Lee about her lies, and she confesses. She lied because she wanted Joker to like her. She wants him to let Joker free. Arthur takes her advice and fires Maryanne. Joker will represent himself and make the world smile. Will he be found guilty and sent to death?<br/><br/>This musical sequel is an ambitious change from the first film. Arthur and Lee perform songs, together and apart, to express their feelings. However, the movie stays grounded when the real world bleeds into the music and dance. The costume designers ensured the world around Arthur was gloomy and gray. But Joker's world had spots of color. The storyline does an excellent job of recapping the first film. The plot slows down for the songs, and sometimes the music drowns out the actors. However, the film is worthwhile. The audience will watch Arthur Fleck's trial and Joker's birth.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
