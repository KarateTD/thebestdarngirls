    "review":"Amélie wraps up her pilates class, and Barbara pulls Amélie to the side to talk about the new guy, Pierce. Barbara asks them if they will attend her Eyes Wide Shut party. Amélie says yes, but Pierce is not sure. Once Pierce leaves, a woman waves at Amélie from the window. Amélie comes outside and tells the woman the class is over for the day. The woman, Fran jokes that she will come to class if Pierce does.<br/><br/>Amélie gets her dog, Buster, a new engraved dog tag, but Buster runs away. Pierce found the dog and remembered Buster from a picture in Amélie's studio. Amélie wants to pay Pierce back with money, but he wants private lessons instead. She agrees to the arrangement.<br/><br/>Amélie and Pierce go on a walk and talk about their past relationships. Amélie's ex-boyfriend cheated on her multiple times. However, Pierce's latest relationship ended after she stalked him and harassed his clients. They attend the party a few days later, and Amélie confuses another masked man for Pierce. Amélie leaves, and a masked woman almost rams into her. Amélie passes a door and finds a man dead.<br/><br/>Shaken from the party, Amélie keeps her composure during class but gets the cold shoulder from Barbara. Fran approaches after class and asks about Pierce. When Amélie gives Fran an answer Fran doesn't like, Fran slams Buster's picture and breaks the frame. Amélie tells Pierce about the strange encounter, and he tells her that Fran is his ex-girlfriend. Pierce orders Amélie not to trust Fran and keep her distance. But distance isn't enough because Fran wants Pierce back at any cost.<br/><br/>This film is a throwback to the original 90s Lifetime movie; no more unknown stalkers, dumb cops, or disregard for personal safety. Pierce, Amélie, and the audience know Fran is unhinged and on the warpath. Just to let you know, this movie isn't for younger fans. Pierce and Amélie's passion steams the screen. Their chemistry is undeniable. If you want a touch of old-school Lifetime that makes you yell at the screen, this is your film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cheeks and Fish watch, in horror, as FBI Agent Wilcott shoots their friend, Joey. But they don't know Joey and Wilcott staged the shooting to put Joey in witness protection. Joey settles into suburban life and opens a box of cookies his mother made him. Inside is a note with recipes. So, Joey runs to the store to get the ingredients.<br/><br/>Amanda oversees her daughter's Sunny Girl troop. Amanda's daughter, Sally, and Sally's friends - Nida, Penelope, and Lucy - want to sell the most cookies. The winning team will be on the Sunny Girl cookies box, and the losers will disband. They sell their healthy, organic cookies outside the market, and a kind man tries one for $20. Two thieves grab the girls' cash box, and the man, Joey, stops them and returns the money. Sally records everything on her mother's cell phone. In Joey's haste to get out of the area, he forgot his groceries. So Sally and Amanda return them. Joey teaches them his mother's recipes so they can win the contest.<br/><br/>Joey and Amanda fall in love, but Sally's video goes viral. It alerts Cheeks and Fish to Joey's location. Wilcott saw the video and wants Joey to return to witness protection for a new assignment. However, Joey doesn't want to leave. He likes his new suburban life with Sally and Amanda. Can he keep his quaint life with Cheeks, Fish, and Wilcott on his tail?<br/><br/>Don't mess with mama. While Amanda comes off as a pushover, Joey's mom is a steamroller that sets everyone straight. When watching this movie, remember it came out in 2014. So downloading a file to a computer to put it on the internet was correct for the time. This film is a cute way to pass the time with some familiar faces.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hanna helps Kate and Kate's daughter, Sarah, find their cabin after an awkward encounter. This trip is the first vacation Kate and Sarah have ever taken since Kate left her husband, Jason. Hanna spots the bruises on Kate's arm but remains silent.<br/><br/>One night, Hanna kayaks on the water and witnesses a man pull up to Kate's cabin. The man storms in, and Hanna hears Kate scream. Hanna hurries home and calls the police. Officer Cooper informs Hanna that Jason returned with his mother, Alice. After talking with the family, Cooper believes everything is alright. However, Hanna can't shake the feeling that something is wrong in that house and goes to check, but Alice is on her doorstep. Alice tells Hanna that Kate is unstable. Convinced that something is wrong in that house, Hanna pledges to keep digging. However, she becomes the main suspect and has to battle for her freedom. Can she win?<br/><br/>Once again, Lifetime cops are absolute morons. While Alice tries to plant seeds of Kate's psychopathy, the plot offers too many clues to consider otherwise. The story does give you two strong misdirections with a credit card and spray paint. While this movie won't be a favorite, it will keep you entertained for two hours.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Officer Connor picks up his daughter, Lily, from school, and Lily's teacher, Mrs. Cooper, pulls Connor aside. Mrs. Cooper tells Connor that Lily is an introvert that spends more time with her imaginary friend, Milly. Uneasy, Connor tells Mrs. Cooper he will work on it with his wife, Jenny.<br/><br/>Jenny is a successful mommy blogger, but mentioning Milly brings up upsetting memories. Years ago, Jenny gave birth to two girls, one alive and the other stillborn. Jenny doesn't understand how Lily would know about Milly because they don't discuss Milly. Connor tells Jenny to stop talking about Milly, get rid of Milly's memorial, and go to therapy. Soon Lily and Jenny leave Milly in the past and go to a fair to celebrate.<br/><br/>Jenny leaves Lily with a face painter to get information for her blog at the fair. The face painter tells Jenny that Lily is doing well and an extrovert with another little girl. Jenny looks and sees Lily with a girl that looks identical. Jenny takes a picture, and the girl's aunt snaps and takes the girl away. Jenny tells Lily to stay and runs to the sheriff, Ann, with the image. Jenny shows Ann the picture, but it's too blurry. Jenny concludes the other girl must be Milly and runs back to get both girls. When Jenny returns, both girls are gone. Jenny must save them both before Ann arrests her.<br/><br/>Always trust a mother's or twin's instinct. The opening scene tries to make viewers question Jenny, but the title hints that the girl is missing, not dead. When Jenny pursues the perpetrators, she runs into a string of unfortunate incidences. Her battling with her mom-blogger knowledge seems slightly corny, but it works for a Lifetime movie. If you stick with the first hour, the second is thrilling.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
