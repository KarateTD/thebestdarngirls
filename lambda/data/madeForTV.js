    "mtitle": "Before Your Father Finds Us",
    "review": "Mason sits in front of the parole board and pleads his case. He has been a model prisoner for 10 years and believes he deserves to re-enter the world and his family. The parole board says no because they can't trust his actions. Mason snaps, kills a guard, trades clothes, and escapes. When they discover the prison break, they call FBI Agent Farnsworth. Farnsworth informs his partner, Agent Samuels. Samuels wonders if they should call Mason's wife, Alex. Farnsworth's will, but he doesn't suspect Mason will find Alex because she and her daughter, Emily, are in the Witness Protection Program.<br/><br/>Sofia meets her friend, Amanda, at the church's bake sale. Their daughters will be spending the evening at Amanda's home so Sofia can spend time with her boyfriend, Steve. Sofia asks her daughter to take items in the car while she finishes her discussion with Amanda. Sofia doesn't see a man, Mason, quietly approach her daughter, Emily. Mason tells Emily that her mother lied. He is alive and wants them back. He pleads with Emily not to tell her mother he's in town. Emily agrees.<br/><br/>Steve and Sofia's date goes well until Steve gives her a key to his home. He's willing to wait for the woman he loves. Sofia gets a knock at the door and answers it. She's dumbstruck to see Mason on her doorstep. He can't believe his wife, Alex, is standing before him. He tells her he received parole and wants them to be a family. She says she has to tie up loose ends and will leave with him in the morning. He breathes a sigh of relief and exits. Alex locks the door, packs her bag, and grabs some cash. Before she leaves, Amanda calls.<br/><br/>While Emily is at Amanda's home, she sees a news report about Mason. Amanda knew about Alex's past and name change. She calls to warn Alex. After Alex hangs up, Agent Farnsworth calls. Alex angrily updates him that Mason is there. Now, they know someone is helping Mason. Army Veteran Alex must use her skills to save Emily and escape a killer. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This film is frustrating because Alex does everything correctly. It's simple mistakes that lead Mason to her. This film doesn't rely on unrealistic methods to locate people. With few characters, the audience will easily narrow down who Mason's accomplice is. However, the writer's passion for booby traps and guns shines through the script. While the plot twist is unsurprising, the film is an enjoyable rollercoaster.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secrets of an Influencer",
    "review": "Jess convinces her boyfriend, Robbie, to visit a bakery promoted by her favorite influencer, Amanda Jane. Jess snaps a picture of her cookies, and Robbie persuades Jess to tag Amanda. Jess does, and later, Amanda likes Jess's post. Jess is star-struck.<br/><br/>Jess arrives at The Gable Inn, and her boss, Mary, gives Jess more busy work. She remembers that Jess has a degree in marketing and asks for a suggestion to drum up business. Jess proposes using discounts on services, but Mary doesn't like any idea that brings in less money.<br/><br/>Jess vents to Robbie about her marketing issues. Robbie suggests Jess send a message to Amanda, asking to stay at the Inn for free. She can post content from there and share it with her followers. Jess loves the idea and presents it to Mary. Mary approves. Amanda agrees to stay at the Inn for content. Jess continues celebrating until she gets a message from Afanda Jane. This unknown person warns Jess to stay away from Amanda. Later, Amanda posts that someone is stalking her and her contacts. She asks her followers to be kind to one another.<br/><br/>Jess prepares the room for Amanda's arrival and creates a gift basket. Amanda has a photoshoot and raves about the Inn's quaint feel. After a few glamour shots, Amanda pulls Jess aside and questions her about strange messages. Jess recalls the DM she got from Afanda. Amanda cautions Jess that Afanda is dangerous.<br/><br/>Jess arrives at work the next day and discovers that Amanda left early. Jess sends Amanda a message of gratitude, but doesn't receive a response. Jess thinks Amanda is missing, but can she get anyone else to believe her?<br/><br/>This movie offers a fun mystery for this generation's media-obsessed culture. While the script could preach about phone addiction, that's not the focus of the story. So don't expect the plot to become preachy. The writers created rich characters with shady behaviors. If you aren't paying attention, you will miss the bit of information that sets the wheels in motion. And the conclusion leaves nothing to chance. If the culprit doesn't surprise you, the motive will.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Unwrapping Christmas: Lily's Destiny",
    "review": "Lily arrives at work to discuss the Christmas Gala sponsored by her store, All Wrapped Up. Her co-owners, friends Olivia, Tina, and Mia, want to focus on Lily's date with the state's most eligible bachelor, real estate agent Owen. Lily glanced over her horoscope, and it predicted that an unexpected love would come. Then, she gets a call from Sean. He wants to interview Lily for his newspaper.<br/><br/>Lily sits with Sean, and they talk about college. They discover they attended the same school and had a class together. Lily almost forgets about Owen until she receives a text message. She ends the interview with Sean, but he doesn't have enough information for his article. Lily offers to meet again to answer business questions.<br/><br/>Lily arrives at the restaurant to meet Owen, but he's late. After a while, he enters, orders some wine, and talks about himself. Lily engages in polite conversation while seeing signs about Sean. She's ready to leave, but Owen wants to see Lily again. She's unsure until she talks to her friends. They convince her to give Owen a second chance. But they can't ignore how much Lily gushes over Sean. Just then, Sean walks into the store to gather information for his article. Lily's friends encourage her to ask him out, but she's not sure he's single. Lily throws caution to the wind and runs out of the store. She sees Sean play with a child and hug a woman. She assumes it's Sean's wife and son. Liily slowly backs away. Later, Sean develops feelings for Lily, but he sees pictures of her and Owen on a blog site. Can these two read the signs and come together? Or will they let miscommunication stand in the way?<br/><br/>The third installment of the Unwrapping Christmas franchise adds astrology to the holidays. Lily lets horoscopes and divine signs guide her life. The script explains that Lily's beliefs stem from her father's love of the stars. He died recently, and she isn't handling it well. The plot introduces a nosy neighbor, who will be your antagonist until you learn her backstory. Now, Owen will make your skin crawl. He is self-absorbed and annoying. This film has more compassion than the others, while sticking with the same plotline. However, Lily doesn't have the same number of Gala issues as the first two films. This film fits easily into the first two and gives a glimpse into the fourth. Nevertheless, it doesn't require your undivided attention to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Faith in the Flames: The Nichole Jolly Story",
    "review": "Nurse Nichole's husband, Nick, wishes her a happy early birthday after she referees an argument between their sons, Jordan and Logan. Nichole's mother, Heidi, visits before Nichole's shift. Nick reminds Nichole that Jordan has a game today. She's missed every game of the season after promising she would make one. Nichole wants to focus on her patients, but agrees to take Jordan to school.<br/><br/>Nichole and Jordan stop at a local restaurant. She overhears a call on firefighter John's walkie-talkie. The dispatcher alerts him to smoke near the transmission towers. He assures her that everything is okay. Jordan leaves with friends, and Nichole goes to work. Nichole hears about the fire but continues to care for her patients. Then, Heidi calls. She encourages Nichole to leave immediately because the fire is coming. Nichole doesn't know it, but she, her family, and the residents of Paradise are about to encounter the deadliest wildfire in California history.<br/><br/>This film is stupendously shot, scripted, and cast. Viewers will watch in fear as the Jollys battle fire, explosions, and tornadoes. It's admirable to watch Nichole and her colleagues work in literal hell. You will say a quiet prayer for every person on screen. As they drive through the fire, the camera angles allow you to see the devastation around them while witnessing the horror on their faces. It's the definition of terror. The picture concludes with the resulting destruction. And the nightmare is ongoing.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
