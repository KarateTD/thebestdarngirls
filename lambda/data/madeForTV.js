    "review":"Keisha cries on the hospital bed her mother, Daisy, died on that morning.  She grabs her mother's bible, finds a letter and puts it away.  Then, she throws the bible in the trash. As Keisha sits in her car, which is now her home, she reads her mother's letter to a man named Elijah Wilson.  She looks him up on the internet and sees Elijah's daughter, Gabriella.  Gabriella is a successful, married mother of Bella, and Keisha decides to hustle Gabriella for money.  Keisha writes a letter to Elijah but signs Daisy's name.  In the letter, Keisha tells Elijah that Daisy never terminated the pregnancy and he has a daughter.  Elijah gets the letter and explains everything to Gabriella. Gabriella sits with her friend and co-owner, Reagan, to talk about Keisha. Gabriella suggests meeting Keisha in Arkansas, but Reagan wants Gabriella to stay because they have a meeting with their biggest client, Justus.  So, Reagan flies to Arkansas and meets Keisha at her hair salon.  When Reagan tells Keisha that she has a long-lost father, Keisha feigns surprise. As soon as she gets into Gabriella's home, she will get Gabriella's bank account numbers, and her friend, Buck, can start stealing their money.  During her Atlanta trip, Elijah's loving nature starts to win Keisha over.  But when she feels belittle by Gabriella, Keisha decides to take Gabriella's husband, job, money, and daughter.<br/><br/>Based on the novel, Envy: A Seven Deadly Sins Story by Victoria Christopher Murray, this movie starts like a Lifetime movie but ends like an Up TV movie.  So if you are expecting a Lifetime knockdown drag-out fight, you will be disappointed.  Everyone played their part to perfection. Don't expect a Lifetime movie with guns, fights, and crazy looks at the end.  But stick around for the drama, falls, and crazy behavior.  And let's not forget the two bible verses: Philippians 2:3 and Galatians 5:26.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Saving My Daughter",
    "review":"Another nightmare wakes Joanna.  Years ago, Brittany kidnapped Joanna's daughter, Chloe.  Although Chloe is 18 and safe and sound, Joanna can't let go of the fear and guilt. After Chloe leaves for school, Joanna gets a call from Detective Chen.  Detective Chen worked on Chloe's kidnapping case, and she called to let Joanna know that the parole board decided to let Brittany out early. Chloe goes to school and catches the eye of Javier.  Later, they decide to skip school together.  Soon, the school calls Joanna to inform her of Chloe's absence.  Joanne furiously calls Chloe and punishes her.  Joanna tells Chloe she is only allowed to go home or to the home of their neighbor, Mandy.  Mandy and her son, Kyle, are friends to the family.  However, Mandy's drunk and abusive boyfriend, Craig, is not. After school, Joanne tries to find Chloe, but Chloe is missing. She fears she has lost her daughter again to Brittany. Joanna can't wait for the police to step up, so she goes on the hunt.  She doesn't know that Chloe found a dead body, and her kidnapper won't let her go.<br/><br/>The plot lets the viewer know the kidnapper an hour into the movie because the kidnapper has suspicious actions before the reveal.  The story allows the 'why' to be the mystery.  But not why Craig died, but why someone kidnapped Chloe. The actresses did their best to provoke emotions, but the backing track muffles their voices during crucial scenes.  Save this movie if you need an easy distraction.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"For a year, Tenley has communicated with Jared on a sustainability forum.  But they never met face to face.  Her best friend and roommate, Cami, gives Tenley courage to call Jared and ask to meet him in person.  After Jared says yes to a coffee date, Tenley dances in the street, and her phone slips out of her hand.  Thankfully, a handsome stranger catches it. When Jared doesn't show up on time, Tenley calls but a doctor answers. Jared got into an accident and needs surgery. When Tenley comes to the hospital, she tries to explain they are not married, but the doctor keeps giving her papers to sign. Then Jared's family walks into the room.  They are stunned Jared didn't tell them he got married, but they are happy Tenley saved his life. Lynn, Jared's mother, invites Tenley to stay with the family.  While Lynn and Jared's family are happy to learn about Tenley, Jared's best friend and her phone catcher, Everett, is not. The family invites her to stay the night.  Tenley walks through the house and overhears Everett talking to Jared's dad, Ronnie.  Jared and Everett own a business together.  If they don't come up with a plan soon, the board will sell their company to a conglomerate. Then, Tenley trips into Ronnie's office.  Since Tenley is Jared's wife and understands environmental issues like Jared, Ronnie suggests that Tenley should handle Jared's portion of the business and presentation until things get better.  She agrees but calls Cami. Cami tells her to confess because they sound nice.  Then Tenley hears someone at the door.  It's Jared's little sister, Betsey, and she heard everything.  Betsey tells Tenley not to inform the family because Ronnie and Lynn mortgaged their home for the business.  If Tenley doesn't help Jared and Everett keep the business, Ronnie and Lynn could lose their home.  This web of deceit will put Tenley in the middle of two men, an ex, and a company in distress.<br/><br/>Be ready to laugh out loud and quote this movie for days. Deep down, you will see Tenley is a good person stuck in a situation due to mishaps and misunderstandings. Tenley spent one year telling Cami about him, but he did reciprocate.  This painful realization is something everyone can understand. It will all work out for Tenley in the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
