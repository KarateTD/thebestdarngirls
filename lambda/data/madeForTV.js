    "review":"Lauren walks with her detective father when she gets a call from her friend, Charlotte. Charlotte arrived in Manhattan with her boss, famed fashion designer Virgil St-James. Virgil is having a panic attack. Charlotte wants Lauren to use her expertise as a fashion psychologist to calm Virgil. Lauren runs to Virgil's rental loft and uses the 3-3-3 method to ease his fears. Virgil decides he needs her skills for Paris Fashion Week.<br/><br/>Virgil and Charlotte welcome Lauren to the Lavigne Paris design house. They introduce her to Virgil's core staff. Gerard handles Lavigne's business side while Théo directs the show and coordinates the models. Ondine oversees designs, and Ari is the CEO. hen, Lauren hears Gerard yelling at the photographer, Patrick. He fires Patrick over a poorly lit photoshoot, and Patrick vows payback.<br/><br/>Later, everyone scurries because editor-in-chief Diana arrives to get an advanced look at the show. Gerard warns her about giving the fashions a poor review. He threatens to pull their ads if he can't approve her evaluations.<br/><br/>Lauren sits by the runway and hears fashion blogger Tabi arguing with Gerard. He placed her behind a column, and now she fumes. Then, a rival designer, Riccardo, demands to speak to Virgil, but Virgil briskly walks away. Lauren can see a model, Naomi, is upset and wearing another dress. Virgil picked another model to be his muse by placing his pin on her and giving the model the top spot in the show. Before the models approach the catwalk, Virgil and Charlotte put a metal signature hairpin in their hair.<br/><br/>The show ends, and Charlotte collects the hairpins. Then, Lauren hears Charlotte's screams. She runs upstairs to find Charlotte with a box of hairpins and Gerard dead with a hairpin stabbed in his back. Inspector André questions everyone in attendance. André asks Lauren if she saw anyone other than Charlotte with Gerard's body at the murder scene. Lauren refuses to lie and says no. After quickly learning that the Parisian wheels of justice run differently, Lauren will do anything to clear Charlotte's name before André formerly charges Charlotte with Gerard's murder.<br/><br/>This new Hallmark Mystery movie is a series in the making. The script provides Hallmarkies with a detailed description of its leading protagonist, Lauren, at the beginning. And Inspector André has a complex backstory. The plot offers several suspects with rivalries, resentment, and revenge in the cut-throat fashion world. However, one statement from a goon will give the culprit away, but Hallmarkies will watch to uncover the motive. This film is a gripping start to a promising franchise.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Best friends Jenna and Emily move into their dorm with their mothers by their side. Madison approaches them and talks about the Beta Kappa Epsilon sorority. Emily worries about drinking, but the president, Brittany, says sisters under 21 are not allowed to drink. Madison, the vice president, and Brittany invite Jenna and Emily to a mixer.<br/><br/>Jenna and Emily meet several sisters at the BKE house, including Dana. Dana drinks tea and water because alcohol can negatively affect her blood sugar. The girls party but return to their dorms to make the first day of classes on time. Emily eagerly wakes up Jenna for classes. Jenna and Emily walk together and find Dana dead in the courtyard.<br/><br/>The police report that Dana was drunk and hit her head, but Emily knows that can't be correct. After more incidents, Emily decides not to pledge, but Jenna stays. Emily believes Madison and Brittany are corrupt leaders on a power trip. And Brittany hasn't gotten over her ex-boyfriend, Spencer, who dates every girl in the BKE house. Soon, Emily is alone, and the BKE sisters get injured, threatened, or disappear. Is Emily right to be concerned?<br/><br/>The title is deceptive because the body count is low. However, the plot does capture your attention with a juicy whodunit. You must watch this movie until the end because it wraps up quickly and puts a nice bow on everyone's story. If you are an adult watching this film, remember these young women are immature and figuring out life. This film is a fun way to spend 2 hours.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Historian Doctor Angelica sits in a shared office with her office mate, Dana, and discusses how much Angelica loves her job at the museum. However, Dana can see that Angelica has had her eyes on their boss, George, for years. George comes into their office and requests Angelica follow him.<br/><br/>Angelica stands stunned when George introduces her to King Felipe and Queen Leticia of Saint Pablo. It's tradition for the king to abdicate the throne at age 65 and crown his heir. The king will be 65 in two weeks but never had children. The king's distant family came to Miami years ago, and that family has an unknowing heir, Ramone. They want Angelica to help Ramone prepare to become a king. They will fund the museum and Angelica's research trip to St. Pablo if Angelica is successful.<br/><br/>The king and queen visit Ramone and inform him of his royal bloodline. They ask him to meet with a beautiful woman, Angelica, and have dinner at the most exclusive restaurant in Miami. At the dinner, he gets up, walks out, and invites Angelica to join him. He orders 12 tacos and hands most of them to homeless people. He informs Angelica that he has no desire to be king. However, Angelica believes he is a diamond in the rough.<br/><br/>George requests an update. Angelica tells George that Ramone is hesitant but thinks he will be ready. They need the king and queen's philanthropy to save their department and Angelica's job. Angelica's determination solidifies. However, the king's advisor, Carlos, watches to sabotage Angelica. If Ramone rejects the title, St. Pablo will become a republic, and Carlos will be the president. Can Angelica succeed in a royal makeover, or will Carlos reign supreme?<br/><br/>This movie has a gender swap with the guy discovering he is a king. Ramone second-guesses his ability because his mother taught him negative self-worth. However, Angelica and the audience can see he is benevolent, determined, and understanding. This film is funny, charming, and well-acted. But the backing track drowns out the actors several times. So enjoy this movie with your remote to turn up the volume.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Karla, Joli, Sharell, and Rebel planned a phone-free girl's trip at an exclusive spa. They board a private plane to the spa. Later, Karla wakes up in a field with burning plane wreckage around her. She stumbles around the site and finds Joli with an injured leg and Sharell. They yelled for Rebel, but she did not survive.<br/><br/>Karla's husband, Mark, invites Joli's husband, Jared, Rebel's husband, Evan, and Sharell's husband, Andre, into his screening room. Mark turns on the TV to watch the feed of the women in the woods. At first, Jared, Evan, and Andre think it's a joke or a new reality show. However, Mark tells them it's real and part of his plan. They will all be free of their problem if the women die. When Evan doesn't see Rebel on camera, he questions Mark. Mark congratulates Evan on getting the bonus prize because Rebel died on impact. Evan flies into a rage and tries to attack Mark, but Mark pulls out a gun and forces Evan into a panic room. Mark locks the door behind Evan and returns to the screening room. Andre and Jared privately discuss a way to save their wives while escaping a madman. Will Joli, Sharell, and Karla make it out alive?<br/><br/>This movie is a compelling idea with poor execution. The message is about housewives, lost in marriages, finding their self-worth to escape their husbands' control. However, this empowerment plot becomes hindered by bad acting, horrible graphics, and flat jokes. If you are not a Real Housewives fan, skip this film.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",
