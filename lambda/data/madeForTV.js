Later that night, Dr. Paul calls, not with a nutrition plan, but with a game plan for her heart.  Within a few dates, Grace is head over heels for Dr. Paul. Their relationship is going great, so she starts to believe in love again.  At a party, Dr. Paul sees a man touch Grace's arm.  He pulls her aside and starts chastising her, questioning her fidelity, and roughing her up. To ease his mind, she promises her commitment and loyalty to him.  Even with that promise, he is quick to anger, tracks her movements, and alienates her from her friends. She reduces her flight schedule and works with him on his new business venture of selling nutrition shakes.  With business booming, they move into a house together.  As she unpacks his boxes, she finds legal paperwork.  She finds sexual harassment, peeping, and stalking charges filed from ex-girlfriends and patients. After a push, Paul slaps her.  Before Grace calls it abuse, she will be on the wrong side of a gun, in hiding, and writing a letter of regret and warning.<br/><br/>Inspired by Ann Rule's Mortal Danger and Other True Crime Cases, this movie shows how the stigma of abuse will force its victims to keep quiet and make excuses for their abuser.  Grace doesn't want to call Paul's actions abuse because she doesn't consider herself a victim. When she sees the truth, Paul is pure evil. This movie is one to watch and discuss with those you love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"For six years, 13-year-old Nory waited for this day.  She is going to Sage Academy to practice magic with her best friend, Reina.  Nory can shapeshift into any combination of animals.  Reina can shoot fire from her hands. As they wait for the bus, Mr. Skriff appears from the woods. Mr. Skriff leads them through a portal, and they enter the well-manicured lawn of Sage Academy. The headmaster, Ms. Knightslinger, introduces herself and the Sage Way of magic.  At the academy, they have five schools of study.  Each student must take a placement test.  The test will determine their school selection and their level.  After the placement test, Professor Argon chooses Reina for Honors Flares.  Nory's report says UDM. Underground, three students and a professor wait for Nory.  Knightslinger explains the students failed their placement test because their magic is upside-down. In the past, a UDM, named Reginald Roberts, was consumed by shadow magic and tried to take over the school.  Sage Academy will not allow the UMDs to practice magic.  They must stay underground with Professor Skriff until their magic dies. While they are trying to hinder the UMDs, Shadow magic found its next victim and plans to destroy the school once and for all.<br/><br/>Based on the Upside-Down Magic Book Series, this movie isn't about changing yourself to conform to others' standards.  The UDMs (Upside-Down Magic) embrace their differences as a strength.  Not a weakness for evil.  This movie gives a great lesson for kids today.  Being different is wrong.  Doing different isn't wrong.  It's forcing others to change their differences that become detrimental, not only to them but to the world too.  Let's celebrate the Upside-Down is all of us.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Kristen is happy.  Her boyfriend, Ryan, has proposed.  She will gain a husband and a precious little girl named Lisa.  Then, Ryan has something to confess.  He believes his ex-wife, Nina, is calling him from a blocked number.  When Lisa was a baby, Nina drove drunk with baby Lisa in the car. Nina was declared unfit, and he got sole legal and physical custody. Ryan thinks he should see Nina and calm her down, but Kristen convinces him that's a bad idea.  She believes it will all blow over with time like she has done with ex-boyfriends in the past.  Kristen couldn't be more wrong.  During their engagement party, Nina throws a drink in Kristen's face and maces Ryan.  Now, the couple is on high alert.  Just one problem: Nina is secretly messaging Lisa through Instagram.  Nina is hell-bent on getting Lisa back, even if it kills her.<br/><br/>This one is worth the watch because there are no stupid people, bratty kids, or moronic cops.  The main characters have an unlucky sequence of events happening to them, so you get a compelling storyline with characters you care about and a fun twist. This movie is a mix of today's social media and classic stalking. Stalked by My Husband's Ex isn't your typical Lifetime movie with the same characters.  And the end puts a satisfying conclusion to each character.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
