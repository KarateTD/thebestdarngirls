    "review":"Robin and Sam walk into the police station.  Robin walks to Sheriff Watkins and explains Sam accidentally shot her husband, Javier while hunting.  Sam came to her aid and saved her from dying in the woods.  Sheriff Watkins takes their statement.  Sam goes to a local motel, while Robin goes home with her mother.  Robin starts to experience panic attacks and remembers more about what happened.  Sam purposely shot Javier and kept her hostage in the woods for several days.  He tortured, brainwashed, and raped her over 5 days.  He agreed to let her go after she promised to lie to the police. Watkins invites Sam to come back and tell his side of the story.  He offers to take a lie detector test. Their results come back and everyone is floored.  Sam passed, but Robin failed. It will take a fax to get to the truth of what happened in the woods.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, you must remember these events happened in the 70s.  People were a lot less skeptical of those around them.  Robin naively instructs Javier to follow Sam to the best fishing lake in the area.  After driving in circles, Javier wants to abandon the plan but Robin wants to keep going. Also, the script alters the real story for the sake of the plotline.  It will help the viewer to watch the real survivor talk about the events that led up to the kidnapping.  The acting and directing were spot on but the script needed more work.  Don't forget to tip your hat to the best mom on Lifetime, Celeste.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Eden tanked her marketing proposal, so her boss asked her to take a break to recharge.  She heads to her parents' summer home in Lake Tahoe with her best friend, Kate.  As they settle in, Kate notices a man in the backyard. Eden walks over to introduce herself and realizes he is her old friend Riley. Riley owns a hot air balloon company and offers to give the ladies a ride while they are in town. On the hot air balloon ride, Eden learns that business is hard for Riley, so she offers her marketing services to help drum up some new business.  As she works with Riley, she finds her passion.  But Kate wonders if she's found her groove with marketing or with Riley.  As soon as Eden thinks she has things figured out, her boyfriend, Michael, comes to Lake Tahoe for a surprise visit.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't get good until the end.  It tries to throw in a twist with Michael showing up after Riley realizes he has feelings for Eden.  But you know Michael is a non-factor in this story.  This movie is the typical plot of going to your old town to find yourself and finding love with an old flame.  With the predictable plotline, it doesn't make you laugh, cry, or gasp to break up the monotony of the story.  However, Eden's selfless act at the end is the saving grace of this movie.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Flight attendant Grace Tanner doesn't believe she will fall in love.  She is 38 and wants real love with a real connection.  Since her love life is on the rocks, Grace finds a new way to better her life.  She meets with a nutritionist named Dr. Paul.  Later that night, Dr. Paul calls, not with a nutrition plan, but with a game plan for her heart.  Within a few dates, Grace is head over heels for Dr. Paul. Their relationship is going great, so she starts to believe in love again.  At a party, Dr. Paul sees a man touch Grace's arm.  He pulls her aside and starts chastising her, questioning her fidelity, and roughing her up. To ease his mind, she promises her commitment and loyalty to him.  Even with that promise, he is quick to anger, tracks her movements, and alienates her from her friends. She reduces her flight schedule and works with him on his new business venture of selling nutrition shakes.  With business booming, they move into a house together.  As she unpacks his boxes, she finds legal paperwork.  She finds sexual harassment, peeping, and stalking charges filed from ex-girlfriends and patients. After a push, Paul slaps her.  Before Grace calls it abuse, she will be on the wrong side of a gun, in hiding, and writing a letter of regret and warning.<br/><br/>Inspired by Ann Rule's Mortal Danger and Other True Crime Cases, this movie shows how the stigma of abuse will force its victims to keep quiet and make excuses for their abuser.  Grace doesn't want to call Paul's actions abuse because she doesn't consider herself a victim. When she sees the truth, Paul is pure evil. This movie is one to watch and discuss with those you love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
