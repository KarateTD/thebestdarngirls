    "mtitle":"The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel",
    "review":"In Detroit 1963, Dr. Mattie has a 3-part harmony dream.  She wakes up her 5 daughters, Jacky, Denise, Dorinda, Twinkie, and Karen, to sing her dream.  Typically the girls sing the same note.  But with a little practice, they get the harmonies just right.  Ten years later, Dr. Mattie’s husband Pastor Clark is sick of Mattie being gone to attend to her ministry.  He wants her to be a proper first lady of the church, stay home, and attend his meetings by his side.  After abusing her and her daughter Jacky, Dr. Mattie files for divorce.  She puts all her focus on her daughters’ singing career.  With all the success, comes trials and tribulations.  Unlike most groups, The Clark Sisters have to deal with the secular and spiritual problems.  Can Dr. Mattie keep her girls together when heaven and hell are trying to pull them apart?<br/><br/>The true story of the Grammy Award-winning group The Clark Sisters, will move you to tears and bring a spiritual awakening with their harmonies.  With each pentacle of success they reach, the church tries to keep Dr. Mattie in her place.  She tries to navigate the church’s strict dress code, expectations of music, and demands of her musical ministry to keep her title in the church.  Eventually and sadly, something has to give.  Through it all, The Clark Sisters remained true to themselves and never lost sight of their true passion: bring the word of God to the world.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sinners Wanted",
    "review":"Pastor Leo Shepard travels from Georgia to DC to head a long-standing church.  The church elders greet him with a warm familiarity, food, and high praise.  They ask him what he needs.  He responds 'Sinners'.  During his first sermon, G.G. runs into the church and sits in the pew. Ignoring her weary look, the ushers ask G.G. to leave.  However, Pastor Shepard tells them to leave her be and let her stay.  When G.G. is confronted by her pimp, Wolf for his money, she tries to explain why she doesn't have any. She tells him she went to church.  He starts to beat her and leave her on the church's doorstep.  After praying, Pastor Shepard leaves and sees G.G. on the steps bruised and beaten.  He cleans her wounds and allows her to sleep in the church's bed.  The next morning, the elders are furious with the Pastor.  They don't want G.G.'s kind in their respectable church but Pastor Shepard will not change his ways.   If they are furious now, they will be inflamed when the Pastor courts and marries G.G., making her their first lady. What will Pastor Shepard choose: The church or his wife? Neither will make it easy.<br/><br/>If you ever wanted a movie to display what everyone dislikes about the church, this is it.  They talk about wanted to help the community but don't want the community to be apart of them. When One-Eye starts spilling the tea, your mouth will be left open. This movie will have you taking in a hard look at yourself and your church.  Another plus is for DC locals, this movie was actually filmed in DC.  Using historic landmarks, the transit system, and mambo sauce to set the stage.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"You're Bacon Me Crazy",
    "review":"Cleo runs a successful food truck in Portland. At the farmers' market, Gabe notices Cleo closely examining tomatoes.  They talk and realize they have a shared love for cooking. As she prepares for her next service, she sees a new truck in the area called Mo'Bacon.  The chef opens the door and she sees the chef is Gabe. While Cleo is focused on the truck, her family and friends believe she should start a restaurant.  Cleo believes a full menu is a very daunting task.  Also, she doesn't have the money.  Her niece Tessa found a solution on-line.  Famous chef and restauranteur, Norma Duncan is hosting a Food Truck contest. The grand prize is $100,000.  With that money, Cleo can start her restaurant or make improvements to the truck.  Gabe believes in her too and stays by her side to offer words of encouragement. Days later, Cleo and Gabe are having fun when Cleo gets a notification.  Her food truck is in the competition. Then Gabe gets a notification.  His truck won as a write-in.  Now, the two love birds are competitors.   Will their budding romance survive the competition?<br/><br/>Based on You're Bacon Me Crazy: A Wish Novel by Suzanne Nelson, this movie must be accompanied with food.  Preferably a carbonara or a BLT.  Their passion for cooking is as strong as their passion for each other. Unlike most Hallmark movies, they don't hate each other, have a romantic past, or are forced to work together.  They meet, they fall, they have good and bad days, and they work it out.  That is a real relationship on the Hallmark channel.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
