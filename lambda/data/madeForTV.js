    "review": "New evidence frees Monica after six months in jail. However, Trevor's sister, Detective Ebony, believes Monica or Simone should be behind bars. After some time, Monica considers returning to Houston on her terms. She wants to start a podcast discussing the number of innocent people behind bars. Monica tells BeBe, who is ready to leave Seattle.<br/><br/>Joy calls her mother, Simone, from college. Joy's classes are going well, but she's struggling to make friends. Simone understands Joy's turmoil and wants to help. Simone video chats with Sister Margaret. She wants to return to Houston to help Joy. However, Sister Margaret warns Simone that her past awaits her there. Simone doesn't heed the warning and flies to Houston.<br/><br/>Ebony asks her boss for time off to mourn Trevor's passing, but that's a lie. She flies to Houston to keep an eye on Monica. Later, Sister Margaret travels to Houston. She visits Monica to warn her that Simone could be in town. These women's lives will collide when someone kills Sister Margaret. This spree killer won't stop until everyone pays. But who is the culprit?<br/><br/>This movie, unlike its predecessors, isn't a revenge story. It's a murder mystery. A person in everyone's life dies or becomes a potential victim. So viewers are unsure of who to blame. The plot will have you guessing until one dinner scene. You will spend the remaining time watching to prove you are right. This final installment wasn't the series' high note, but it's a fun movie that closes the book on every character. And their conclusions are acceptable and entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Erin and Cade discuss their future scholastic plans. She wants to skip spring break and concentrate on finishing her project. Erin cuts Cade off to talk to her roommate, Kaley. Kaley warns Erin that Cade has a crush on her. Kaley then begs Erin to join her on spring break, but Erin says no. She and Cade will be some of the few students remaining on campus over the break.<br/><br/>Erin runs into Kaley in the hallway. After talking with her mom, Erin changed her mind about spring break. Kaley jumps for joy, but Cade isn't happy. He leaves, and Erin parties with Kaley in the dorm hallway. Later, Erin enters her room and finds Cade there. Cade hits Erin and knocks her out. Erin wakes up alone but can't open the door or window. Also, her phone is missing. Cade walks into the room and admits he has changed the locks. He won't let her leave until she realizes she loves him like he loves her. Can Erin escape?<br/><br/>This movie isn't the best entry for the 2025 Spring Breakdowns series. The start gives the audience some foreshadowing of Erin's eventual escape. However, Erin makes unforgivable errors. Also, Cade's dialog is a whiny regurgitation of the manosphere. The shining light in this film is Erin's RA, Anna. She listens to her instincts and sounds the alarm by contacting campus security, checking on Erin, and reaching Erin's emergency contacts. Viewers can skip this movie unless they need to scream at the TV.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Security guard Wayne calls his daughter, Robyn, on her 18th birthday to offer well wishes. However, he becomes upset at her dismissive tone. Wayne surprises Robyn by showing up at his ex-wife's home to take Robyn to a basketball game. The pair take a walk in the park, and he convinces her to go.<br/><br/>Robyn and Wayne look for seats when a woman, Donna, compliments Robyn on her boots.

But they assume Robyn ran away to be with friends. Pam permits Wayne to do anything to anyone to get Robyn home safely. He knows they are on borrowed time. Can Wayne save Robyn before she's lost forever?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this film gives an all-too-familiar sad tale of human trafficking and the police's slow response. The plot takes a moment to build because it focuses on Robyn and Wayne's strained relationship. This build allows the viewers to understand how Donna quickly lured Robyn away. The actors gave a stellar performance and allowed the audience to connect with each character. Also, the movie explains why some victims return to these horrific circumstances. The sets have noticeable budget constraints, but the well-choreographed fights ease those shortcomings. It takes time to build the climax, but the drop to the conclusion is fast-paced and exciting.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
