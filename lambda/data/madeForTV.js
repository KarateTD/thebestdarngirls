    "review":"Whitney has been groomed to win Homecoming Queen her entire life.  Her mother, Connie, and her Grandmother, Evelyn, have been queens.  It's Whitney's destiny to follow in their footsteps.  When Natasha, a recovering addict shows promises, Whitney doesn't know what to do.  Evelyn tells her to take control of her destiny at any cost.  Whitney's plan for control involves cyber bulling, catfishing, drugs, and murder.<br/><br/>This movie has a big build up but the ending falls flat.  You expect a fight but you get nothing but confused looks.  However, this movie offers a much better support system than any other Lifetime movie.  Normally, Natasha would not be believed becase she is a former addict.  However, her mother and the police believe and help her.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
