    "mtitle":"Revenge Delivered",
    "review":"Dr. Victoria Brooks is an awarded OB GYN at St. John's Hospital.  With Dr. Peter Evans's assistance, Victoria will guide three young doctors through their residency programs.  Claire is a bright student with a can-do attitude and quick leadership skills.  Luna is a guarded Dartmouth graduate with a minor in psychology.  Noelle took a year-long sabbatical from medical school, but she is ready to start the program.  However, Claire and Luna feel that Noelle has an unfair advantage because Victoria is Noelle's mother.  After the residents leave, Victoria finishes her paperwork when the printer jams.  She runs to the printer to check, and a message prints off that reads, 'I know what you did 10/22/95.'  Victoria remembers that day because she had to choose between saving a mother or a baby.  Victoria saved the baby's life, and the mother died.  Victoria passed the father, Russel Myers, in the hospital, and she could feel his rage. Victoria leaves work and finds her car vandalized.  She takes pictures of the damage and finds a rock with a note.  The note reads, 'Next time, it won't be the window I break.'  Victoria calls the police and tells them she suspects Russel of the attacks.  Detective Garcia takes Victoria's hunch seriously because Russel has been off the grid for eight years.  But Victoria's stalker is closer than she thinks and ready to deliver revenge.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of a slow burn with a low body count.  But the last 30 seconds makes watching the film worth every minute.  With a suicide attempt, an uncomfortable dinner, and an unfortunate tattoo, this movie points the viewer in several directions at one time.  Be ready for part two.  And hats off to the wardrobe department for Dr. Victoria's stunning looks.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Daddy's Perfect Little Girl",
    "review":"After losing her biological mom to an abusive boyfriend and her adoptive mom to cancer, Ella wants to keep her dad, Nolan, all to herself.  Since he worked overtime for the past few weeks, Nolan promises to take a long weekend from work and take Ella to adventure camp. Then, he gives Ella a bigger surprise.  His employer booked her favorite TV star, Juliette Lee, for a commercial. At the commercial shoot, Juliette brushes off Ella's selfie request and pays more attention to Zander, the son of the set designer, Cecily.  Ella's rage boils because she believes Zander is stealing Juliette. Later, Nolan tells Ella he has a date with Cecily, but he has to cancel adventure camp because his boss, Gabrielle, has to help her mom find a home in New York.  Ella likes Cecily, but Zander and Gabrielle are on her hit list because they are taking what she wants, Juliette and Adventure Camp, respectfully. What will it take for Nolan to see the flaws in his perfect little girl?<br/><br/>This movie is 'Bad Seed' with a history of trauma.  The writers ensure watchers understand that Ella has a history of abuse and trauma after witnessing her step-father, Gino, kill her biological mother. So it's easy for the viewer to understand why she forms such an unhealthy bond with Nolan.  She is willing to poison, self-harm, and kill anyone who may take him away or their time together.  This film is one to watch in horror as this little girl manipulates Nolan every step of the way.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"While people still come to her mother's restaurant, critics say Caroline's food lacks passion.  Then, Caroline gets sad news that her Aunt Doreen passed away and left Caroline her café in Australia. Caroline's mother, Denise, tells Caroline to take the trip and get away from the restaurant and the critics.  Caroline takes Denise's advice and heads to Australia to sell the Seagull Café.  At the Seagull Café, Caroline orders everything on the menu and takes note of what she does and doesn't like about the food.  After trying everything, Simon, her B and B host, comes over to her table and asks for her opinion.  Without hesitation, she tells him everything wrong and asks the waitress to bring the chef.  The waitress points to Simon. Caroline tells Simon and the staff that she will be selling the café to a franchise. Marla tells Simon to woo Caroline to make her want to stay. Simon refuses to help Marla, but he does offer to help fix the place if Caroline tries to negotiate job security for the staff while taking over his chef duties. With Doreen's recipes, Caroline discovers the passion for cooking she lost.  But what a New York Cheesecake vs. Meat Pie cook-off, Caroline will find her love for Simon.  Too bad her ex-boyfriend, Nathaniel, is on the way.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is a girl-finds-boy-while-finding-self story, but it unfolds differently.  Caroline knows she has feelings for Simon, but she chooses not to act on them. She puts business first and refuses to let love overcome her focus.  That tiny change makes this movie stand out among the Hallmark catalog.  And thanks for shooting in Australia with Australian actors.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
