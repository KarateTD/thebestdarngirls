    "review":"Charly finishes another mind-numbing interview and gets a call from her partner, Lark. Godfrey, their in-house designer, has been complaining to the board about Charly. Charly tells Lark if they don't like her, then they can fire her. But Lark knows this is an empty threat because Charly is the face of the company and owns 51%. Charly pulls herself together for the next meeting with the board. They want to go forward with production, but Lark disagrees. Charly gets a creepy doll, death threats, and harassing phone calls. Lark knows that Charly's death would tank their stocks, so she and the board insist Charly get a bodyguard. Charly disagrees.<br/><br/>Ex-marine Jonathan and Vargas are bodyguards for actors on a TV show. Jonathan hears a woman screaming for help in an actor's dressing room and barges inside. Jonathan hits the actor, and the woman escapes. The actor runs to the producer, and the producer fires Jonathan. Jonathan gets a call from Lark to protect Charly, and he accepts the job.<br/><br/>Charly leaves her home for work and finds a man kneeling by her car. Jonathan appears behind her and tells Charly to lock her doors. In fear, she sprays him with mace. She finds him attractive but lays down the ground rules. On the surface, Jonathan complies, but he won't let someone hurt a woman on his watch. Charly thinks a bodyguard is unnecessary, but she is wrong. Someone is out to kill her and will not stop until they do.<br/><br/>Is it wrong to like the killer? The murderer does their due diligence on police investigations, background checks, and trials in the public eye. But with all that homework, small things trip up the killer. It's easy to dislike Charly. She presents herself as a strong woman but has the decision-making of a 3-year-old on caffeine. Don't be surprised if you side with the murderer in this film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dying For a Family",
    "review":"Hannah and Darcie have a few drinks before meeting with their foster parents, Keith and Jillian, to celebrate Hannah's birthday. She and Keith decided to adopt Hannah and Darcie. They come home, and Hannah doesn't want to stay. She tells Jillian she wants to hang out with Caleb instead. Jillian forbids Hannah to see Caleb, and Hannah grabs the car keys. Jillian attempts to pull the keys out of Hannah's hand, and Hannah gets cut. Darcie checks on her sister and sees Hannah escaping. Hannah explains that she is going to sneak out and see Caleb. She wants Darcie to cover for her, and Darcie agrees. Darcie wakes up and can't find Hannah. Then, Darcie texts Hannah but doesn't get a response, so she confronts Caleb. Caleb says he never saw Hannah last night and walks away with his girlfriend, Tiffany. Panic and fear set in because Darcie thinks Hannah is missing, but she doesn't want to tell anyone. If Social Services find out, they could remove Darcie and Hannah before Jillian and Keith can adopt them. Darcie must find Hannah without losing her family.<br/><br/>Darcie is the adult in this movie as the police are useless, and Jillian has a mental breakdown. Darcie picks up the pieces, lists the suspects, and collects the evidence. She is a one-teen police force. Caleb isn't winning any awards either. He thrives on being a suspect and scary. One moment all viewers would wish for is the pimp slap. Jillian was so close to giving it, but a dumb cop stopped her. While this isn't the best movie Lifetime has to offer, it's an entertaining watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Joanna wants her daughter, Lizzie, to come home, but Lizzie has to work again. When Joanna suggests that Lizzie works too much, they argue, and Lizzie hangs up. Joanna drives to Lizzie's college to apologize, but her professor, Trevor, says Lizzie wasn't in class. Joanna waits outside Lizzie's dorm room and runs into Lizzie's R.A., Zoey. Zoey lets Joanna into Lizzie's room, and Joanna sees the room is trashed. Joanna sees a picture of Lizzie and Lizzie's best friend, Nicole, and asks Zoey about Nicole's location.<br/><br/>Joanna goes to the bar Nicole works at and asks the bartender for information. With some coercion, the bartender admits that Nicole and a few other employees left to become webcam girls. Joanna walks into Nicole's house and finds her webcam setup. She clicks on the computer, and her heart sinks when she finds Lizzie's video for clients. Then, Joanna finds Nicole in the bed dead, and someone attacks Joanna and leaves her unconscious. Joanna wakes up and calls the police. She is determined to find her daughter and bring her home safely.<br/><br/>This movie has a short list of vial suspects, but the writers understand that experienced Lifetimers can see the culprit. However, the motive is intriguing. The writers sprinkled hints throughout the story. So you won't notice it until the end. This film would be a welcomed addition to the 'Don't Mess With Mommy' marathon in the future.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Never Would Have Made It: The Marvin Sapp Story",
    "review":"In Grand Rapids, Michigan 1993, Marvin sneaks behind a dumpster with his best friend, Jackson, to drink and do drugs. When they finish, they come to school inebriated, and Marvin walks face first into a pole. Malinda bends down and asks if Marvin is ok, but Marvin is too stunned by her beauty to speak. Jackson tells Marvin to stay away from Malinda because she is dating a jock, JC.<br/><br/>Marvin and Jackson mistakenly ask a police officer to buy them alcohol and run home. Reggie is the boyfriend of Marvin's mother, Lodena. Marvin and Reggie get into a war of words, but Lodena breaks them apart before the arguing gets physical.<br/><br/>Marvin leaves the house to hang out with Jackson and sees Malinda in a car with JC. After an altercation, Malinda leaves with JC, and Marvin and Jackson have bumps and bruises. During lunch, Marvin sees Malinda alone and discovers she broke up with JC. Marvin hears a song on Jackson's boombox and sings. His voice inspired the congregation and gain recognition from people in the music industry.<br/><br/>Everyone can see that Marvin is a saint on Sunday and a sinner every other day. Henry, Marvin's father, warns Marvin to be a leader. And Kevin, the local drug dealer, refuses to sell to Marvin because Kevin can see Marvin's gift. Marvin hears them, but it takes death, epilepsy, marriage, children, and colorectal cancer, for Marvin to see his calling.<br/><br/>During each chapter in Marvin's life, he connects it to verses in the bible. He doesn't use this movie to excuse or gloss over his behavior. He delves into it to make viewers understand that nothing came easy. And each barrier brought him to the man he is today. This movie wants you to see beyond your failures and mistakes and to envision your purpose through faith and loved ones.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma is a sous chef for her boyfriend, Garrett. She wants to run a restaurant someday, but Garrett doesn't believe she is ready personally and professionally. After a critic compliments Emma's family-style serving and smoked paprika cashew aioli, Garrett takes the credit. Emma leaves Garrett, quits her job, and flies to Hawaii to visit her aunt June. Emma walks into a surf shop while June makes reservations.<br/><br/>Frankie can't help but notice his brother, Ben, slept in the shop last night. Ben lost his wife years ago and still mourns her today. Since then, Ben hasn't been able to surf, and he won't give lessons to wayward tourists. Frankie and Ben walk to the front of the store and see Emma looking at surfboards. She wants to know what will be best for a beginner and asks if he teaches surf lessons. Before Ben can object, Frankie accepts.<br/><br/>The first few lessons with Ben are not stellar, but they give Emma time with Frankie. Frankie loves to cook a fusion of Hawaiian and Puerto Rican cuisine. He entered the Annual Big Wave cooking competition with Katie Lee Biegel as a guest host and judge. On the first day of the competition, Emma learns the winner gets $15,000, and her nerves start to build. Then, she gets a gut punch. Garrett is the guest mentor. He came to Hawaii to win Emma back and have her join his staff. Then Ben walks into the competition, and they smile at each other. Garrett sees the subtle glance and knows he's on borrowed time. With a groundswell coming, can Emma stay on the board of life?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Groundswell by Katie Lee Biegel, this movie displays how knowing a person's pain points can allow you to manipulate them. This movie makes fun of other H.M.M. films by stating that Emma wants to surf to find herself. They build each other up to become a better version of themselves with a little pineapple rum trifle, tropical fruit pavlova, and mango mojito. Also, viewers learn about Puerto Rican history in Hawaii. While the film has a classic misunderstanding, the conclusion will leave a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
