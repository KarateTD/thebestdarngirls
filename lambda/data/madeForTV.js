    "review":"Barbara found the home of Delilah and Shawn's dreams. Delilah sees all the markings of a basement but doesn't see one.  Barbara tells Delilah that she will double-check the plans and let her know if there is a basement.  During a trip to the hardware store, Delilah runs into Jay, the man who designed her home.  He is curious to see what she has done to the house.  Delilah allows Jay to follow her home.  During the tour, the two start to click, and Delilah wants to work for him.  After a few short moments, Jay agrees to allow Delilah to work with him. As work starts to mount, Delilah is collapsing under the pressure.  Delilah sees figures moving, unknown decor appearing, and cabinets opening on their own. As the old saying goes, just because you're crazy, it doesn't mean they aren't after you. Someone is out to get her, and they want her to pay for a huge mistake.<br/><br/>Secrets in the Basement isn't what you would expect from the title, but it does cover the Lifetime basics.  You have the over-trusting lead going crazy, the husband trying to help, and the nosy best friend that never disseminate all the necessary information at one time.  While the movie does try to add suspense for the person in the basement, experienced Lifetimers will be able to figure it out in 5 minutes.  The killer's motives are what drives viewers to watch.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
