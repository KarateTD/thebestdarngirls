    "review": "Colleen's mom, Vanessa, doesn't understand why Colleen left New York for a cul-de-sac called Sunny Vista. Colleen walks home from the market as the neighbors take notice of the newcomer. Her bag rips open, and the contents fall on the street. Quinn picks up an item while saying hello but leaves Colleen to finish the retrieval. Dan runs over with a box to contain the food as Jared watches. Jared's wife, Kimberly, chats about Colleen with her friend Ashton on the neighborhood app. They attempt to learn about Colleen's marital status and job. Jillian, the H.O.A. president, forcefully reminds Colleen that the H.O.A. is having a meeting tonight and suggests Colleen change clothes.<br/><br/>The H.O.A. meets at Theo's home, and everyone gives Colleen the third degree. After the meeting, Colleen gets notifications from the neighborhood app. As Colleen reads other messages, she sees everyone discussing Edith's unkempt property. Colleen bakes a pie and walks to Edith's to offer cleaning help. She finds Edith dead with a fireplace poker in her abdomen.<br/><br/>Colleen collects herself at home when she sees movement at her back door. She calls the police and grabs a rolling pin. To Colleen's surprise, it's Theo with a jar of sauce. He disclosed that he has mushrooms, and they get high. Colleen wants to tell Theo about her past, but he receives a message. An anonymous texter accuses him of selling smut. Theo says he knows the caller and leaves to confront them but promises to return. Colleen comes down from her high in the morning, but Theo never returns. Days later, Colleen finds Theo's mangled body. Neighbors worry that Colleen is the killer because she was the last person with Theo. Can Colleen clear her name and find the culprit before another person dies?<br/><br/>Where to start? You should watch this film if you want a funny and unhinged movie. The mystery is compelling and gives viewers an unforeseeable culprit. After Colleen takes drugs, you won't be sure if she's still hallucinating these events. And you have to assume Edith's killer is the person wearing the mask. They never explicitly say who killed her. This movie has drugs, affairs, murders, and BDSM. Viewers should watch this movie with a glass of wine and a good sense of humor.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadly DILF",
    "review": "Elysium lives with her Aunt Kendra after Elysium's attacker killed her father. She is attending college and on the track team. A football flies into her backyard, and Elysium walks over to the neighbors to return it.<br/><br/>Rio and Tori are married. He is studying business in college, and she runs a gym. Tori is the stepmother to Rio's son, Gunnar, and they recently moved into the neighborhood. Gunnar answers the door and smiles at Elysium. They introduce themselves, but there is an attraction between Rio and Elysium. Later, Elysium babysits Gunnar and helps Tori with the gym's social media accounts.<br/><br/>Rio and Elysium spend time privately, and she unknowingly watches him from afar. Rio drinks heavily and sleeps with Elysium. She awakens and dreams of a life with him. However, he wants to forget the night and Elysium. Elysium won't go without a fight. This DILF will need to become deadly before Elysium takes everything from him.<br/><br/>Elysium's attack at the movie's start doesn't get an explanation or a meaning. Fans assume they will revisit the beginning sequence, but we never do. Viewers will feel bad for Rio until you discover this is his second affair. The final sequence has many poor choices and doesn't explain Rio's outcome. Also, Elysium's conclusion doesn't feel fair. The ending starts with Elysium's letter to Rio, but you don't hear the letter. This film has a wild premise and action but leaves viewers with unanswered questions.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

She agrees, but he must drive straight home.<br/><br/>Johnnie orders and sees a young man, Tim, harassing a young woman, Leslie. Johnnie tells Tim to leave Leslie alone, or Johnnie will disqualify Tim from making the baseball team. Tim lunges for Lesley again when Leslie's mother, Carlie, enters. Carlie forces Tim to leave and grounds Leslie for poor grades. Then, she turns to Johnnie and questions him about not going home like he promised. Johnnie asks Carlie on a date.

    "mtitle": "Nelly Knows Mysteries: A Fatal Engagement",
    "review": "Nelly reports to work and discusses her column with Fiona. Nelly cycles through her mail and finds a letter without a return address. The letter is from a woman who suspects her boyfriend of cheating. Nelly, from the small town of Babbleton, knows everyone and recognizes the hearts above the I's. The letter is from Dahlia, who is dating Blake. Nelly wants to handle this face-to-face.<br/><br/>Nelly arrives at Blake's workshop and finds the door open. She peers inside and finds Blake dead with $20,000 in his pocket. Nelly calls the police. Sheriff Burgi introduces Nelly to the new detective, Michael. Michael interviews Nelly about finding the body. Nelly reveals everything and hands Michael the cash. Burgi gives this case to Michael to prove himself, but she tells Michael to work with Nelly because Nelly knows the town. Dahlia says she spoke to Blake the night before, but he rushed her off the phone. She doesn't think he was cheating but keeping a secret. Nelly tells Dahlia to talk to Michael but convinces Michael to let her sit with Dahlia during the interview. Dahlia completes the interrogation, and Michael allows her to exit, but she remains a suspect. Nelly promises to clear Dahlia's name. Can Nelly and Michael find Blake's killer?<br/><br/>This plot has several moving parts and people with bad intentions. The night before Blake's murder, Blake had a poker game. Each player had a secret. Blake has a neighbor, Rumple, who dislikes him and his prior devious acts. Nelly is a new type of protagonist for Hallmark Mystery fans. She is unapologetically happy and keeps an earth-shattering grin on her face. However, you learn that her smile holds a lot of pain. The wrap-up pushes lots of information in 10 minutes and will require a second watch to keep up. Nevertheless, this film can become a series with a developing romance.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
