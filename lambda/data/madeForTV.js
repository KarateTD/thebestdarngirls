    "mtitle": "Miss Cleo: Her Rise and Fall",
    "review": "Youree runs lines before her sold-out performance at a community center. She leaves rehearsals early after a script disagreement, and the director, Carl, runs after her. Everyone knows she got a grant, and they want her to pay them now. Youree won't budge and drives home. She leaves with her daughters and the theater's grant money.<br/><br/>Youree arrives in Fort Lauderdale with her daughters, Crystal and Lena. She looks at the newspaper for jobs and finds one for the Psychic Readers Network. The manager hands Youree a document and tells her to sign it. It states that Youree is a psychic. She signs and gets on the phone. Youree goes off script, fakes a Jamaican accent, brings tarot cards to work, and calls herself Miss Cleo. She becomes Fort Lauderdale's #1 phone psychic.<br/><br/>Peter enters a frustrated Steven's office. Their telecommunications company dwindles, and Steven needs help. Peter gives Steven the Fort Lauderdale numbers and delightfully says they are from one operator. Peter tells Steven to arrange a meeting with Youree.<br/><br/>Peter and Steven meet with Youree. They ask her to become a spokesperson for the network. Steven likes her style but wants to change Miss Cleo's backstory. Youree agrees to become the face of the network after dinner. For Youree, this is another acting job. However, she's joined a billion-dollar scam.<br/><br/>First, The Lady of Rage pulls an award-winning performance in this movie. Next, the writers ensured they didn't make Miss Cleo a hero. Viewers should listen closely during Youree's first meeting with Peter and Steven. Steven uses many words to say they are collecting and selling customer information without their knowledge. During her fall, Youree's status makes her the face of the scam, and falsely, the mastermind. Some viewers may consider this unfair, while others say it's karma. This conclusion leaves that decision to the audience. So, watch and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Stepmom from Hell",
    "review": "Izzy returns home to pitch her app, Trusting Paws, to investors. However, they don't want to invest after they discover her father, Jack, isn't behind it. Izzy travels to Jack's home for a party. Jack is celebrating the 30th anniversary of his company. As Izzy and Jack converse, Jack notices Izzy's stepsister, Dana, walk past. Jack stands on the steps to give a speech to his dedicated workers. However, he forgets who they are halfway through.<br/><br/>Dana informs Izzy that Jack hasn't kept up with the expansion. Izzy is happy Jack has Catherine, but Dana speaks poorly about her mother. Jack sits down, and Dana tries to talk about the issues. However, Jack cuts her off and tells Dana to give the problems to his secretary, Terry. Jack tells Izzy he wants her to take over the business while she gets her app off the ground. Izzy relents.<br/><br/>Izzy enters the office on Sunday to look around. Days earlier, someone broke in and rummaged through the files but didn't steal anything. Izzy looks through the file room and sees a bank statement for $700,000. Someone transferred the money from Jack's business account to the Credence Account. Later, Izzy spots Terry shredding documents on the business's day off. She questions Terry, and Dana answers. Dana warns Izzy to back off and leave them to handle things.<br/><br/>Izzy visits his father and finds him on the bathroom floor with blood on his head. She begs Catherine to call 9-1-1, but Catherine calls Dr. Jeffery. Izzy pulls Dr. Jeffery aside and alerts him about Jack's memory loss. Dr. Jeffery tells Izzy to bring Jack into his office immediately.<br/><br/>Dr. Jeffery asks Jack questions and believes Jack has the early signs of dementia. Then, Catherine barges into the room and threatens Dr. Jeffery and Izzy. Later, Catherine serves Izzy with a restraining order. Izzy won't back down because Dana and Catherine are trying to take her father and his company. Can she prove it before they take it all?<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn with strange backing tracks and bad lighting. As the title states, Catherine is the perfect villain. She is loving, charming, and fun when you meet her. But Dana warns Izzy that Catherine has a dark side. She is pure evil. Her monologue blares with narcissism and contempt. This film seems slow. However, the last 30 minutes will thrill you if you stick it out.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "I Thought My Husband's Wife Was Dead",
    "review": "Pregnant Layla talks to her husband, Leo, on the phone while he is away for business. Layla ends the call and hears someone banging on her door. Shocked, Layla sees a homeless woman calling herself Leo's dead wife, Vikki. Through the doorbell camera, Vikki tells Layla she is alive and wants her life back. Vikki leaves and spends the night on a bathroom floor.<br/><br/>Vikki walks into Karing Salon for a job. So the owner, Kerin, offers Vikki a job in exchange for room and board while Vikki looks for a better position. Karin asks her to take a pregnant woman to the hospital because the woman is having complications. The woman, Layla, refuses Vikki's help until the pains worsen. Vikki drives Layla to the hospital.<br/><br/>The doctor puts Layla on bed rest, and Vikki drives Layla home. Vikki takes advantage of the situation and steals Layla's clothes and shoes. Vikki takes a nap on Layla's sofa and cooks after waking. Vikki jumps and lunges a knife when she hears a noise behind her. It's Leo, and she cuts him. He wants to know where Vikki has been.<br/><br/>Vikki explains that a man grabbed her while she was running in the woods five years ago. She calls him the monster. Then, he shot her and left her for dead. Vikki's father died before her kidnapping and left $80,000. She wants that money and one of Leo's cars to start over. Leo confesses that they are broke. Vikki demands the money by the end of the week or else. She takes cash from Leo's wallet and his car. Layla and Leo want Vikki out of their lives, but Vikki won't make it easy.<br/><br/>Based on Unmissing by Minka Kent, this movie is a visual chess game. Characters say things that feel trivial but return in the wrap-up. It will make viewers' heads spin. Layla is a greedy woman who purchases two of everything and knows their family's financial woes. Leo moved on from Vikki but traces of Vikki are in his restaurant in loving and disturbing ways. And Vikki is a forgotten woman scorned. You won't know who comes out on top until the last 3 minutes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
