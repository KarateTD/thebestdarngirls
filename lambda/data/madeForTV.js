Then, Luke remembers he forgot to bring cookies for Thomas's rehearsal and asks one of his brothers to get them from his home. Taylor says he will get the cookies.<br/><br/>Taylor arrives with store-bought cookies and gives them to Thomas to distribute. He is hyper-focused on the piano player Caroline.

    "mtitle": "Christmas on Call",
    "review": "Dr. Hannah Williams finishes her rounds for the evening when EMT Wes brings in another patient. He gives her a synopsis of the patient information, and Hannah saves the person's life. Hannah goes home, and her neighbor, Mrs. Martino, gives her a manicotti. It's the Philly way. Hannah sits at her table and calls her father. He encourages Hannah to explore the city and get away from the hospital.<br/><br/>Wes motivates the rookie, Julia, so she can stop second-guessing her abilities. Fire Chief Anderson enters the room and gives everyone their duties. Then Wes's cousin, Officer Danielle, arrives with her partner, Officer Sanjay.<br/><br/>Danielle and Sanjay shared a New Year's kiss but never saw each other afterward. They must work together after Sanjay's partner had an unexpected leave of absence. Now, they have to put their issues aside for their job. Luckily, they have enough crazy calls to distract them.<br/><br/>Nurse Emerson calls her daughter, Chloe. Chloe is in the military and stationed overseas. Chloe catches Emerson up on her activities, but the call disconnects. Emerson returns to her matchmaking duties. She catches Wes and Hannah conversing in front of her desk and states they are both single. Wes plans to show Hannah the Christmas side of Philly. These people are all on call for Christmas.<br/><br/>This ensemble movie is 9-1-1 for the holiday with less drama. Every first responder has a connection to the other, and they have an unbreakable bond. Danielle and Sanjay have a romantic past, but the flame died before it started. Emerson and Chloe miss each other but understand the distance. Hannah and Wes fall in love while dating someone with the same hectic schedule. This group needs each other and the city to have the life they want. This film has the potential to be a yearly series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Susan finishes work early and drives home. She calls her husband, Cliff, but he's not at work. She arrives home, and Cliff's there but won't let her inside. Then, Susan sees a man's legs on her living room floor. Cliff says someone came to hurt him, and that person is dead. Cliff tells her to walk away and leave everything behind because her life is in danger. Susan walks away without her phone or car.<br/><br/>Natalie arrives to talk to her estranged mother, Susan, but Susan isn't home. She runs into Cliff in the driveway. Cliff says Susan went on vacation, but Natalie doesn't believe him. Susan's car is there, and Natalie sees blood on Cliff's wristband. She fears the worst.<br/><br/>Later, Natalie breaks into Cliff's home. She finds Susan's phone and blood. This evidence confirms Natalie's suspicions. Natalie then asks her uncle Tom to help her get more clues for the police. During their search, the credit bureau alerts Natalie. Someone used her information to open a credit card and post office box. Susan could be alive and using Natalie's information. Can Natalie find the truth behind her stolen life?<br/><br/>Seriously! Everyone should know that running from a crime you didn't commit makes everything worse for yourself. Luckily, Susan walks to a town with sympathetic women. They help her earn money, find lodging, and purchase clothing. Natalie refuses to give up. The movie seems aimless because the monologue holds most of the plot. Lifetimers should skip this movie unless they need background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Book editor Harper asks her boss, Nancy, for a 1-month sabbatical. Harper lost her passion for books. Nancy agrees to give Harper the time off. Harper's friend, Jazz, asks Harper what her plans are. Harper has no clue until she gets a notification. Months ago, Harper signed up for Christmas in a bookstore. The winner gets to live in an apartment above the store rent-free if they work in the store. Jazz thinks it's a sign, and Harper chooses to go but won't tell people her occupation.<br/><br/>Harper arrives at The Book Cabinet and meets the owner, Sowyer. Harper questions why the bookstore has more wine than books. Sawyer explains they had to pivot like many brick-and-mortar establishments. Harper wants to implement some ideas, but Sawyer says no. Harper settles into her new home and pulls out a gift from her best friend, Kimberly. Kimberly created a holiday bingo card with several tasks for Harper to complete before Christmas. Harper laughs at the list but wants to complete it.<br/><br/>Harper gives Sawyer a few more suggestions after helping customers, but Sawyer isn't receptive. Then Harper overhears Sawyer's conversation. His parents want to sell the bookstore. They knew running the business wasn't his dream. Sawyer dreamed of being a writer.<br/><br/>Sawyer's friend, Joyce, invites Harper to the reindeer games. Sawyer warns Harper that he's won for several years. Harper takes this as a challenge and makes a side bet. He has to take her suggestions if she wins. Otherwise, he can continue to ignore her. Either way, Harper wants to lend her expertise to his manuscript. She will be his guiding light while he helps her cope with pain and guilt.<br/><br/>This plot is different because Harper's job isn't the big reveal. She tells Sawyer and her friends the truth when she decides to help Sawyer. The writers didn't have the main characters reveal their secrets at the film's conclusion. And they took realistic steps in their newfound relationship. It's a refreshing spin on the Hallmark Mystery plot.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Gracie put the finishing touches to the most lucrative design of her career, Happi Hotel. Gracie and her co-worker, Amy, talk after their boss, Lucy, praises Gracie. Amy sees splotches on Gracie's screen. Gracie assumes it's food and tries to wipe it off. Then, she notices they are plots of land that are one foot by one foot. She can't understand why the owners, The Carbells, would sell small pieces of land no one could build on. This information could halt production. Amy encourages Gracie to investigate.<br/><br/>Gracie goes to Marybeth in Happy Hollow, and Marybeth doesn't know about the mystery plots. She tells Gracie to talk to Jack at the historical society. He discovers that the Carbells wanted to boost town morale. So they raffled five plots of land on their Christmas tree farm. The winners kept the tree that grew on their land for free. He advises Gracie to meet with Coralie Carbell.<br/><br/>Coralie is a known recluse who doesn't get visitors. Coralie remembers the raffle and a brief description of two contestants. She politely yet firmly escorts Gracie out of her home. Jack takes pity on Gracie's plight and offers to help Gracie find the five winners. Gracie learns about Happy Hollow traditions and residents. She has to win their minds and hearts, but Jack has a secret. The first is that he's falling in love with her, and the second could halt construction.<br/><br/>Happy Hollow makes this movie worth watching. The mystery of the contestants will intrigue you. Also, Gracie has to ingratiate herself with each of them to convince them to sell her their plot. This film wraps a love story in an enigma, but the romance won't captivate you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
