    "mtitle":"The Evil Twin",
    "review":"Emily leaves her abusive boyfriend, Jared, and gets picked up by her best friend, Lena.  Since Lena will be out of town, she offers Emily a place to stay, a car, and a job. Emily heads to work, and the neighbor, Vera, gives her a dirty look and doesn't believe this woman came back to town.  Later, Blake rear-ends her car, gets out, and tells her to leave, or he will kill her.  But during the threat, Blake calls Emily Charlotte.  Emily's curiosity grows, and she tracks down Linda, a real estate agent who gives her dirty looks too. Linda explains that Emily had an affair with her husband a week before he died.  Emily assures Linda she is not the woman, and Linda tells Emily that she must have a twin.  And that twin is evil.  Emily asks for the twin's location, and she drives to find this twin.  The door opens, and Emily sees her twin, Charlotte.  They were separated at birth and adopted. Emily and Charlotte can't believe they landed in the same town at the same time.  Charlotte wants to continue the conversation, but Emily must leave for work.  While Emily is happy to have a twin sister, Charlotte creates a devious plan to get out of trouble and start a new life before Blake and Linda convince the police she killed Trevor.  Charlotte won't let anyone get in her way, not even her long lost twin sister.<br/><br/>This movie begins with a strong start, slumps in the middle, but picks up at the end.  Experience Lifetimers will get the hint that differentiates these twins for Emily's new love interest, David. It does help to pay attention in the middle because it gives Charlotte's backstory with the town. The conclusion doesn't leave room for interpretation or a continuation.  The end finalizes all the character's storylines.  While it's not an H.M.M. mystery, it's a decent Lifetime thriller.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Blueprint to the Heart",
    "review":"Tiffany ponders what her ex-boyfriend, Hayden, could want after he calls her for an impromptu meeting.  Hayden discovered her design talent and helped her become a home restoration TV personality. On the date, Hayden drops a bomb.  The network chose him to be a co-producer on her show, and he wanted to give her a heads up so she wouldn't be surprised. At the network offices, the boss tells Liz and Tiffany the ratings are down, they want to change the show's direction without alienating fans or sponsors.  Instead of renovating a home, the boss wants Tiffany to renovate a person and their lifestyle.  And they have just the perfect guy.  During the last renovation, the carpenter's wife went into labor, and Brooks had to replace him.  He and Tiffany butted heads, but it rated high with the focus group. If she doesn't get this right, Tiffany could lose her show while Hayden watches.  But the more time Tiffany spends with Brooks, she starts to wonder if the show is what she wants.<br/><br/>You must watch the first 20 minutes of this movie. It sets the tone and pace with a lot of laughs and uncomfortable moments.  From Tiffany's meeting with her ex-boyfriend to Brooks's shirtless and wet introduction to TV contestants, you will laugh from beginning to end.  While this movie is humorous, it packs a lot of heart. Brooks's minimalist tendencies have a deep-rooted cause that stems from his past heartbreak.  While Tiffany attempts to makeover Brook's life, he can see that she is unfulfilled in hers. You will be concerned about both and highly invested in the movie's conclusion.  Give this movie your undivided attention.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Producer Kelly took Wakeup Milwaukee from rating slump to rating darling in a year. She repeatedly misses important dates and gatherings to improve the show.  On New Year's Eve, Kelly sits with her friends at a restaurant and makes a New Year's resolution.  For the entire month of January, she will say yes to all invitations.  Next to Kelly's table, Marketing Strategist Tom sits with his friends. Tom bets, 'I can predict anyone's resolution.'  He goes to Kelly's table, and he gets everyone's right but Kelly's.  When Kelly tells Tom her resolution, he is intrigued. When Tom isn't looking, Kelly writes down her number and puts it in his pocket.  He calls her and hopes to see her again.  At her first 'yes' resolution, a polar plunge, Kelly sees Tom.  His company, Imperial National Bank, sponsors the challenge and other activities to promote their bank to the local businesses. But when she gets a hot tip about fraudulent bank practices at Imperial, Kelly will have to choose between Tom and a career-making story.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies in this genre, the sole focus isn't the love story.  The love story is the catalyst for the bank fraud mystery.  When Kelly tips Tom on the fraud, she begs him not to tell his bosses until she gets all the evidence.  Tom has to choose between helping the company he has been with since college or the woman he met a few weeks ago.  It's loyalty versus love. Hallmark should make a resolution to create a part two for this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
