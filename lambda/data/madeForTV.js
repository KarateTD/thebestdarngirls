    "mtitle":"The Bobby DeBarge Story",
    "review":"Bobby DeBarge wishes he could do it all over again as he thinks about his career and childhood.  He was the eldest son in a family of 10 with interracial parents.  His father, Robert, was physically, mentally, and sexually abusive to his children.  Now, Bobby's star is falling as his siblings' careers are taking off.  Jealousy is hidden behind more drugs.  Bobby's pain will lead to a family, prison, and a life full of regret.<br/><br/>First, you must get past the bad wigs to enjoy this movie. Next, DeBarge fans won't learn anything new about Bobby or the family from this movie.  Movie lovers won't get a true idea of this family's talent because only a few songs are displayed.  But, this is still a heartbreaking movie.  Seeing the children abused by their father and the pattern of abuse continue with the family will make you sick to your stomach.  It's amazing more of the family didn't turn to drugs.  This movie feels more like a Part 2 of the DeBarge movie than a Bobby DeBarge movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After spotting her dad's picture on another family's wall, Eve runs to her mom Sylvie with the horrible news.  However, Sylvie starts the conversation first and tell Eve she knows that her bulimia is back.  Eve decides to keep quiet about Mark.

They develop a friendship which allows them to move on and grow.  But when Sylvie betrays Grace, it will pull them apart.  Can they get back on track?<br/><br/>This movie will take you on a roller coaster ride.  Since this movie is based on a book, it doesn't give you the Lifetime movie of a dead husband.  Instead, this movie gives you adult conversations, reasonable solutions. and a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Anniversary Nightmare",
    "review":"Liz and Andrew celebrate their 10th anniversary in Hawaii.  However, she wakes up alone with blood on her.  When the cops investigate, they find a burning body and arrest Liz.  Liz is able to get back to the mainland because her mother pulls some strings.  Liz tries to maintain a sense of normalcy, but she is arrested for manslaughter and tampering with evidence.  In prison, she makes friends that convince her to investigate Andrew's disappearance on her own.  This first step in her plan: break out of jail.<br/><br/>This movie uses the Lifetime platform but changes your suspected ending.  The ending will throw seasoned Lifetime fans for a loop while still being unsatisfying.  This movie feels like a statement for prison and sentencing reform than a mystery plot.  Also, the backing track is often too loud and there is an outrageous number of close-ups.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amy is a script consultant for a local play.  While there is scripted drama on stage, the real show is happening behind the scenes.  Three men love the same woman, Bella.  Her husband Duncan.  Her ex Sebastian.  And her co-star Elliot.  But when a stage light almost kills Bella, Amy is worried but Bella wants to continue.  During the play, Lacey comes on stage and fires her gun.  To everyone's surprise, it fired a real bullet almost killing Bella.  Det. Travis stops the play and makes it an active crime scene.  The play is over but Bella still has the after party.  Duncan and Elliot fight and the party is over.  The next morning someone will be dead.<br/><br/>Record this movie and watch it 3 times.  There is so much going on because you aren't unraveling the case with Amy, you are a part of it.  The murder doesn't occur until after the 1st hour.  You may believe you have it figured out.  But you don't.  This is a strong mystery that needs your undivided attention.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
