    "mtitle":"Girl in the Shed: The Kidnapping of Abby Hernandez",
    "review":"Abby Hernandez is a spunky 14-year-old trying to gain independence while depending on her mom, Zenya, for wake-ups and laundry.  She runs out the door, sans socks, and misses the bus.  When Abby walks home, she sees Zenya driving away.  Abby decides to walk to school, but her feet start to hurt.  So she hitchhikes.  Then, Zenya finds Abby at Abby's locker and gives her a pair of socks.  Abby is grateful, but the boots have done their damage.<br/><br/>Later, Abby talks to friends but realizes it's late and runs outside.  But she misses the bus again and walks home.  Abby decides to hitch a ride home and gets into a car with an unknown man because her feet ache.  He handcuffs Abby, puts a hat on her, and makes her close her eyes.  With a shock collar, mask, and letter, Nate will keep Abby hostage for months while Zenya tries to convince the police and the world that Abby didn't run away.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this film will make your blood boil.  Nate held Abby hostage for months and made her commit crimes while spewing crazy 9/11 conspiracy theories and pretending to be in the military.  He was an unhinged drug dealer with explosive anger.  He watched the news and attempted to diminish Abby's hopes.  As Abby fights to stay alive, Zenya battles with the police, FBI, and public opinion.  Abby and Zenya made Abby's escape possible.  This film did a great job of displaying the challenges Abby and Zenya faced.  But it removed Abby's broken mental state after her escape.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Framed By My Sister",
    "review":"Alex's husband, David, waits in the car while Alex confronts her identical twin sister, Reina, for missing their mother's funeral.  Reina didn't want to go because she felt that Alex blamed her.  Furious, Alex leaves, and Reina follows, saying, 'I love you.'  But Alex never says it back to her twin.<br/><br/>Alex goes to New York, and David plans to meet with his mistress, Holly.  In less than 24 hours, Alex gets a call from the police.  They found David dead, and someone turned off his security cameras and stole money from the safe.  After looking through street camera footage, police see a woman that looks like Alex and Reina getting out of a car.  They examine the photo and learn its Reina's car.  Since Alex was out of town, they arrested Reina.  While the woman in the photo looks like her and Alex, Reina knows something is off.  Reina will dig into their mom's past to find it.  She will uncover her sister, Trinity.<br/><br/>Hats off to the editor! You forget that you're watching one actress play three roles during the final scene.  This sequence proves a film doesn't need the highest budget to create a perfect scene, just creative angles with excellent timing.  The script offers 'A Simple Favor' vibes but doesn't involve the same mystery.  But it's worth a watch if you need to kill two hours.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Haunted by Murder",
    "review":"After Liz recounts the Amityville case with the Real Murders Club, Aurora remembers the first body she and Sally found.  While in high school, Aurora bet Jake that Arthur could make the winning field goal.  Aurora had to spend 15 minutes in the Enshaw house because she lost.  Rumor had it that Enshaw's ghost haunted the home.  Once inside, Aurora, Sally, and Arthur hear sounds and 'Get Out Now' written on the mirror.  She reaches into a desk for a rag to wipe off the mirror and pulls a lever for a hidden door.  Aurora opens the door and walks down the staircase, and finds Frank Brunelli's dead body at the bottom.  Frank was a well-known ghost hunter and paranormal researcher.  The police ruled the death an accident, but something about that never felt right to Aurora.  Then Phillip mentions that Aurora's mother, Aida, bought the house, and Aurora wants to look around.<br/><br/>When Aurora gets to the house with Nick, Sally, and Phillip, they see Tom storming out and threatening Aida.  He is a realtor who wanted to tear down Enshaw's house and build a mansion.  Aida outbid him, and he vows to report her.  The contractor, Reggie, looks over the home to prepare a quote.  Aurora decides to look into Frank's work and uncovers that the paranormal society exists.  And to top it off, Lillian is their secretary.  Lillian tells Aurora that Frank's brother, Anthony, has Frank's papers, and Lillian calls Anthony to help.<br/><br/>Lillian arrives with Anthony while Aurora explains the situation.  The neighbor, Mona, comes over in a fugue state during the commotion.  Aurora remembers Mona because Mona's husband, Linden, helped contact authorities when Aurora found Frank's body.  Then, Tamara, Mona's daughter, comes charging in with a mouthful of apologies for Mona's behavior.  Anthony admits he considered Frank's work an embarrassment to his family, shocking Lillian.  Aurora and Nick hear music coming from the hidden door in the middle of the night.  Nick attempts to investigate, but someone or something pushes him down the stairs.  Nick is ok, but Aurora wants to prove that ghosts are not involved in Nick's fall or Frank's death.<br/><br/>Based on Real Murders: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery by Charlaine Harris, this episode has multiple suspects, motives, and criminals.  There are several crimes for Aurora to solve with many suspects over decades.  Having the crime span decades sets this mystery apart from others in the series.  You will watch it several times and keep it on your DVR.  But there is one question the film leaves you to answer: is the house haunted?<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Swim Instructor Nightmare",
    "review":"Sabrina got a call from Parker Scott to give his daughter, Ashley, swimming lessons.  Sabrina arrives for the first swim lesson, and she is smitten with Parker.  Parker says Ashley's mother, Ellen, is away for a while, and Ashley is afraid of the water after an incident.  Sabrina persuades Ashley to get in the pool, and the lesson goes well.  Sabrina goes home and looks up Parker on the internet.  Her mother, Vickie, tells Sabrina to stop fixating on Parker because it ruined her swim career.  A year ago, Sabrina fell in love with her coach, Coach Sharky.  When the coach didn't reciprocate, Sabrina attacked him.  She lost her chance to try out for the summer games and gained a reputation.  When Sabrina continues, Vickie grabs the phone to call Sabrina's doctor.  Sabrina grabs an iron skillet and hits Vickie in the head, killing Vickie instantly.  Sabrina believes nothing will stand in her way until she is face to face with Ellen.<br/><br/>While the plot is generic, the acting pulls it all together.  On the one hand, Sabrina's burst of anger, quick thinking, and manipulation will make you chuckle with evil delight.  On the other hand, Ellen's life falling apart after a stint in rehab will break your heart.  This open wound within the family dynamic is easy for Sabrina to infect with drugs and alcohol.  This movie boils down to sulfuric acid, trust, and a well-placed golf club.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Song of My Heart",
    "review":"Bonnie and her friend, Emmie, beam with excitement.  Their tea shop will have its grand opening in less than 24 hours.  Bonnie's father, Hank, is a well-known singer.  She watches him work on a song and helps Hank with the lyrics.  Hank wants to try writing songs again.  But after a betrayal, Emmie only wants to write poetry.<br/><br/>Ryder's manager calls because he wants Ryder to finish his album.  Ryder has the melodies but not the words.  He decided to find his favorite singer-songwriter to glean information.  He pulls over when he spots the High Street Tea Shop and enters during a poetry reading.  Ryder rudely interrupts the poet to talk to Hank.  Hank tells Ryder to wait until the poet finishes.  As Ryder sits in the back, the poet's words move him, and he wants to talk to her.  The poet is Bonnie.  Ryder follows and compliments her.  Ryder introduces himself to Hank and asks to set up a writing camp.  And while he would like to help, Hank was a co-writer on all his songs.  His wife was the lyricist.  However, Bonnie has her mother's gift.  With a bit of coaxing, Ryder convinces Bonnie to let him watch and learn her process, but she doesn't want her words to become a song.  He agrees.  They will find love one stanza at a time.<br/><br/>While the movie's concept is adequate, it is slow and uninspired.  Before the first commercial break, you will have the plot, issue, and resolution figured out.  Even if you miss a part, you won't feel a need to rewind to catch up.  Nothing is a surprise.  The saving grace in this movie is the music.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",
