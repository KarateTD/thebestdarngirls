    "review":"After the police catch her daughter, Kylie, at a college party, Tonya ground her from two weeks and tells her to stay away from her friends.  The next day, Tonya sees the new neighbors moving in and politely suggest Kylie helps them.  The new neighbors are Anna and her daughter Jessie.  Nine months ago, Jessie lost her sister and dad in a house explosion, so they moved to get a new start.  Kylie understands loss because her dad died in Afghanistan. Also, Kylie discovers Anna is an influencer. Kylie is in awe of Jessie's mom.  After several attempts to invite Kylie to their home for dinner, Anna approaches Tonya and asks to keep an eye on her while Tonya works. Tonya likes the idea and says yes.  So, Tonya is dismayed when she comes home early and sees a party at Anna's house and Kylie's attire. Kylie is furious and wishes her mom was more like Anna.  This change of heart brings pure, unadulterated joy to Anna.  She wants Kylie to be her new daughter.  No matter the cost.<br/><br/>Talk about child abuse.  Jessie deserves your full and unbridled sympathy.  She is manipulated, controlled, and demeaned by Anna to indulge Anna's sick desires.  In the end, Jessie is astute enough to understand she has control over her actions and takes blame for her role.  It's Jessie that becomes an adult during this ordeal.  This movie has the Lifetime plotline you love, but it gives you a fresh dynamic on the mother-daughter relationship.  Beware of mom is a fun watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Clara is a hard-working, divorced, dedicated mom of one.  She is very organized and works for the Parent's Group at her son's, Oliver, school.  Clara steers him towards activities like chess club and drama club to keep him from getting hurt. Alex is a hard-working, disorganized, dad of one.  His daughter, Emma, loves to play soccer but misses her mom.  Years ago, Alex, his wife, and his friend started an advertising business.  Since she died, he works day and night to keep the business running.  He pitches an idea to Hal of Hal's Sporting Goods. Since most consumers are moms, Hal should focus on gaining their trust.  Hal doesn't like the campaign and starts to walk out, then Alex gets a better idea.  He can shoot his next commercial at his daughter's school's Sports Day.  And it would look better if Hal donated $5,000 in equipment to the sports. Alex attends the next Parent Group meeting to tell them about the idea.  While some parents like the idea, Clara is quick to rebuke.  She believes that sports get enough money, so the money should go to other activities.  Also, Sports Day should change to include all school activities. They are electing a new president tonight, so Margaret decides not to vote on the matter. Clara and Alex are nominated.  The Parents Group takes a vote, and the nomination is tied.  Alex and Clara will be co-presidents until the next meeting, where they will vote again. The next meeting is the day before Sports Day. While Alex and Clara butt heads, they will learn about their children, themselves, and find love.<br/><br/>Talk about competition.  As Alex says, for someone who doesn't like sports, Clara truly is competitive. When discussing the children, the movie is quick to point out Alex's faults along with Clara. Oliver focuses on soccer with Alex, giving Emma a chance to focus on drama with Clara. When they see each other's children, they understand another point of view.  It's heartfelt moments like these, that will bring you into the story.  And the conclusion will leave a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Lily drops everything to assist Maggie.  She catches a flight to Harbor Island on a private plane flown by Marcus. Upon arrival, Christy admits Maggie doesn't know Lily is there.  Maggie's pride would have held her back from asking for help.  Lily takes a deep breath and goes along with the surprise. Maggie has some troubling news.  The inn is too much for her to take care of, so she isn't making enough money.  Maggie has decided to sell.  Lily calls her boyfriend, Bradford, and tells him she is extending her vacation.  Lily will stay until the inn sells.  Lily sees Marcus repairing the fence while assessing the needed repairs.  She comes up with an idea.  Marcus runs the Pilots for Pups program, but he has more dogs than beds. She offers to create a website if he helps with the inn's repairs.  Everything is going according to plan, and the inn has caught Bradford's attention.  Lily, who is falling for Marcus, gets a surprise visit from Bradford, then everything goes amock.  Who will have Lily's heart and her aunt's inn?<br/><br/>Starting with a funny aunt, loving cousin, and cute dog, this movie gets your attention.  However, when it falls into the typical cliches, you will feel your mind start to drift.  But, the plot grabs your attention when Bradford's business partner throws him for a loop.  While the setup and conclusion are intriguing, the story arc falls flat.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Robin and Sam walk into the police station.  Robin walks to Sheriff Watkins and explains Sam accidentally shot her husband, Javier while hunting.  Sam came to her aid and saved her from dying in the woods.  Sheriff Watkins takes their statement.  Sam goes to a local motel, while Robin goes home with her mother.  Robin starts to experience panic attacks and remembers more about what happened.  Sam purposely shot Javier and kept her hostage in the woods for several days.  He tortured, brainwashed, and raped her over 5 days.  He agreed to let her go after she promised to lie to the police. Watkins invites Sam to come back and tell his side of the story.  He offers to take a lie detector test. Their results come back and everyone is floored.  Sam passed, but Robin failed. It will take a fax to get to the truth of what happened in the woods.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, you must remember these events happened in the 70s.  People were a lot less skeptical of those around them.  Robin naively instructs Javier to follow Sam to the best fishing lake in the area.  After driving in circles, Javier wants to abandon the plan but Robin wants to keep going. Also, the script alters the real story for the sake of the plotline.  It will help the viewer to watch the real survivor talk about the events that led up to the kidnapping.  The acting and directing were spot on but the script needed more work.  Don't forget to tip your hat to the best mom on Lifetime, Celeste.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
