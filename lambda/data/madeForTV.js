    "review":"Dr. Debora Green has a scrapbook of her dreams.  She wants to become a partner at the Kansas City Medical Center, start a family, and buy a big house in an exclusive community.  She is on her way to becoming a partner and affording the home, but having a family is still a pipe dream.  Then her colleague Dr. Jim chimes in with his perspective.  He noticed Mick Farrar, a medical student, attempting to ask Debora out, but she is aloof to his advances. Within months, the couple marries in her home and starts their family.  Debora feels like her scrapbook is coming to life.  Seventeen years later, Debora has two kids, Kelly and Tim, and tries to juggle work-life balance alone. At work, her boss tells Debora that she won't make partner.  She is a brilliant doctor, but she is frequently late, behind on her paperwork, and has an awful bedside manner. Then, Mike tells the family that he is on the way to becoming the head of cardiology.  With resentment, Debora smiles and congratulates him.  As Debora sees her scrapbooked life disappear, she will go to fiery measures to make sure Mike doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Based on Ann Rule's true crime novel Bitter Harvest, you can debate what caused Debora to start the fire, but you can't argue if it was right to do.  The most disturbing part of the movie is hearing her say she loved her children.  Whether it was a bipolar disorder or extreme narcissism, Debora had a plan for her life.  As she started to gain a dependency on drugs and alcohol, her plan derailed. While Debora committed the crime, the plot explains that Mike's hands weren't clean. His solution was to drop her career, buy a bigger house, and have an affair. Debora had so much potential and a high IQ but lacked empathy and humility.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Grace is starting a new chapter in her life.  She divorced James, took over his restaurant and got a new boyfriend, Alex.  She double-thinks the age difference, but her friends, Kristen and Jaclyn, tell her to enjoy her single life.  Grace is single, but she is a mom to one daughter, Charlie. At night, Grace relaxes in the sauna while drinking wine.  Someone breaks into her home, and she runs to Kristen's house for safety.  The cops can't find the intruder, so her friends tell her to think about security.  While Kristen suggests an alarm, Jaclyn prefers a roommate or a dog. After several failed roommate applications, Grace sits at her restaurant looking over the finances when she hears a woman make a snide comment.  Grace laughs while the woman invites herself over. Lilith wanted to see if she and Grace could get along.  Lilith decorated Jaclyn's baby room, and Jaclyn thought Lilith was a promising roommate candidate. After the five-cent tour, Lilith wants to move in ASAP and rent Grace's furniture.  Grace says yes and starts to feel more secure.  This feeling will be short-lived because Lilith is a dangerous woman that cleans up her messes.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't focus on who is after Grace but why they are after her.  At first, with so many characters with bad intentions and suspicious behavior, it's easy to lump this movie into a mystery genre.  However, the film is a thriller. It's the 'why' that will keep you tuned in.  And when the plot reveals it all, you will discover that Lilith told you the truth.  You didn't listen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Desperate Widows",
    "review":"Paige, a thriller writer, decided to move to Iowa to give her and her daughter, Allie, a fresh start after her husband died. Paige's therapist tells her to give Allie time and join a local support group in Iowa to help her grieve.  Paige heeds his words and joins a group.  After her first group session, Willow approaches Paige, and the women talk about their loss.  Willow tells Paige the group session helps, but The Farm is better.  The Farm is a co-op of women helping women who lost their spouses.  Paige is unsure, so Willow tells her to meet with the CEO, Dianne. Paige likes the idea but worries that Dianne wants her and Allie to stay for three months. Within days, Allie and Paige are driving to The Farm's front gate.  The extensive security worries Allie, but Paige believes it's to keep the women safe.  Paige has no idea The Farm holds secrets of abuse, torture, and human trafficking.  Without a voice, Paige puts her faith in a man that doesn't speak.  Can Paige save herself and Allie before it's too late?<br/><br/>First of all, a lot is going on with The Farm.  It's hard to keep it all straight.  While the movie gives a lot of backstory for the women, it doesn't give too much information about Kianna, The Farm's CFO, and Dianne. It would be better if the plot explained where that deep loyalty originated. To switch a loving co-op to a devilish commune isn't done overnight.  The viewer should be aware of why and when it all changed.  The story is still entertaining without this information.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cindy is the head seamstress for Rebecca's dress shop, but clients don't know that the dresses are all Cindy's designs. Cindy hopes her loyalty will bring financial and verbal notoriety from Rebecca.  The Hamiltons selected Rebecca to design the wedding dress and bridesmaids' dresses for Brooke's wedding.  They want to look their best because this wedding will be on all the society pages and Prince Ronan will attend the wedding.  While hearing them talk about the wedding, Prince Ronan goes to Rebecca's shop to get a suit made that isn't so stuffy but still royal. After a gripping conversation, Ronan asks Cindy out to lunch.  Cindy says yes, but Rebecca shuts it down because they are not allowed to mingle with clients.  Cindy meets with the family to have them try on dresses, and Virginia, Brooke's future mother-in-law, loves Cindy's attitude and invites Cindy to the rehearsal dinner.  While Cindy is gleeful to spend more time with Ronan, Julia is furious. Now, Julia and some of the Hamiltons will do anything to push Cindy aside.<br/><br/>This modern telling of Cinderella has all the classic Hallmark clichés wrapped in each character.  But this story is different because Prince Ronan knows who Cindy is and what she does.  He even rolls up his sleeves and embarrasses himself to ease her stress. Also, Cindy doesn't take trolling lying down.  She quickly stands up for herself and puts her hecklers in their place.  And the chemistry between them is undeniable.  The characters' change in attitude makes this movie a Hallmark favorite.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
