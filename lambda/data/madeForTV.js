    "review":"Toby and her husband, Pat, are empty nesters, and Toby looks for something new to fill her time. Toby works at the local animal shelter, but a local news story inspires her. The program matches dogs with inmates to domesticate the animals so the rescue shelter can find the dogs a forever home.<br/><br/>Warden Jenkins approves the program, and Toby brings two dogs with her co-worker, Deb. Inmates Mateo and Darnell get dogs to train. As Toby gives training instructions, John walks over. He wants to join the program too. John is in jail for first-degree felony murder and robbery. He believes training dogs will bring him purpose behind bars. John gets approval, and Toby gives him a dog. After a few weeks, Mateo wants his sister-in-law to adopt his dog so he can check up on it. However, Toby can't get Mateo's family on the phone and has to give the dog to someone else. Mateo's anger boils over, and he gets in Toby's face. John steps in between them and calms Mateo down.<br/><br/>Toby meets with Warden Jenkins and requests a guard to protect her. Jenkins tells Toby that they are short-staffed and don't have the funding. John offers Toby protection and assistance bringing items from her van. Toby falls in love with John and gives him special treatment. Will she help him escape prison and leave her husband?<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Toby Dorr and John Maynard, the writers added some comedy and confessionals to this crazy love story. In the beginning, you learn that Toby lacks something in her mundane life. Helping dogs and prisoners become her mission, but you are unsure of John's motives. If you pay attention, John slowly tests her by asking for physical contact, adult pleasures, and a phone. If he can get her to bend small rules for the promise of a future, he could depend on her for more extensive favors. In honest comedic fashion, this couple's stupidity brings the story back full circle.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ice Road Killer",
    "review":"Helen drives to pick up her daughter, Lauren, for winter break. While on the phone with Lauren's school to iron out financial issues, Helen almost hits a woman on the road. The woman, Carly, says she was desperate to get someone to stop for her. Carly needs a ride to town to meet with her family. Carly agrees and gets in Helen's car. Carly opens the glove box and spots a gun. Helen says it's for self-defense, and Carly quietly nods. Carly tries not to show Helen that she is freaking out over the gun, but Carly texts her boyfriend, Boyd, the truth. Carly wants to stop their plan, but Boyd says no.<br/><br/>Carly waits for Boyd to attack when Helen picks up Lauren, but he doesn't, and the women drive to their next stop. Carly doesn't know, but a trucker blocked Boyd's car before he could attack. Carly texts Boyd again, but the trucker messages back that Boyd is dead and she is next. Helen and Lauren ride with the vengeful trucker's next victim. And he won't hesitate to make Lauren and Helen collateral damage.<br/><br/>A lot of suspenseful events driven by stupid decisions are the best way to summarize this movie. At first, viewers will believe that Boyd and Carly are the killers, but they are the least of Helen and Lauren's worries. As he hunts down the couple, you don't sympathize with them. Also, you will have little empathy for Helen because she keeps making countless mistakes. Lauren is the only person using their brain. This movie is frustratingly captivating.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma presented her latest idea to her boss, Danielle. Danielle believes Emma is the perfect choice to head their up-and-coming Seattle branch. Danielle knows Emma has a break coming for Emma's sister's wedding. She tells Emma to use that time to think about the new job.<br/><br/>Liam restores bikes but dreams of working on vintage bicycles, and he is happy to be the best man at his best friend's wedding. Liam and the groom, Brett, have been friends for years. At the mixer, Miranda and Brett introduce Liam to the maid of honor, Emma. They know Emma and Liam had one date that didn't go well, but they hope the two can get along for the wedding. Liam and Emma agree to put the past behind them and get along for the wedding.<br/><br/>With six weeks until the wedding, Miranda and Brett get called to their job site for an emergency. They don't want to postpone the wedding because it falls on their 5th anniversary. So they ask Liam and Emma to be their stand-ins and plan the wedding for them. Miranda and Brett want their wedding to be a surprise. Liam and Emma work together to create Miranda and Brett's dream wedding while falling in love.<br/><br/>While the actors try their best, this movie is slow and uninteresting. Predictable movies should be funny, dramatic, or heart-wrenching to keep your attention. However, this film doesn't accomplish any of those goals. Leave this film as background noise for a busy day.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Josh stands outside and gets a text message from his fiancée, Becca, asking him to meet her at the back of the building. Becca hands Josh his ring and says that she can't marry him. Devastated, Josh sits on a bench attempting to figure out what went wrong.<br/><br/>Hannah looks at herself in a wedding dress, and her sister, CeeCee, walks into the room with some unfortunate news. Her fiancé, Marcus, decided to call off the wedding. Too embarrassed to face her family, Hannah climbs out the window and walks to the bench.<br/><br/>Josh and Hannah converse and realize they got dumped at the alter on the same day. Hannah tells Josh how much she was looking forward to the Oahu honeymoon. He advises her to go without Marcus. Hannah asks Josh about his honeymoon plans, and Josh admits to having none. Hannah challenges Josh to take the first flight out and go on his honeymoon. They shake on it and leave.<br/><br/>Hannah goes through her checklist at the terminal to keep herself on task and sees Josh approaching. Later, Hannah checks into the hotel and sees Josh in the lobby. Hannah believes this is a coincidence, but the concierge, Kailani, thinks there is something more. After a few uncomfortable run-ins with honeymooners and each other, Josh and Hannah pair up to enjoy the island together.<br/><br/>Funny beyond words is the only way to describe this movie. You will laugh out loud and double over multiple times as Hannah says and does the most outrageous things at the best time. And let's not forget our new favorite couple, Cal and Nick. They hold nothing back and say everything you are thinking out loud. Sit back and be ready to have a good time.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After shopping for her future job in real estate, Sasha comes home and trips over garbage bags.

While two men grab Memphis, one shoots Sasha in the shoulder.<br/><br/>Sasha wakes up, handcuffed to a hospital bed with detectives questioning her. Sasha says nothing and demands a lawyer. Five years later, Sasha calls her friend, Jewel, from jail to confirm Sasha's release pick-up. Jewel can't make it, but she asked an old friend, Malik, to do it. Malik turns on the charm, but Sasha rejects him. Sasha is not over Memphis. Sasha learned Memphis died while she was in prison.<br/><br/>Sasha and Jewel reconnect, and Jewel offers Sasha a place to stay, clothes, and a car. However, Jewel doesn't tell Sasha the presents are from Malik. Malik comes to Sasha's job and succeeds by getting a date with her. Sasha thinks she has her life on track, but Malik hides a dark side.<br/><br/>Based on Lawainna Patterson's play, Bid for Love displays one woman's trip through self-discovery. For years, Sasha allowed Memphis to take care of her. After some time in jail, Sasha repeats these mistakes with Malik but with detrimental consequences. This film will confuse you because there is zero conclusion, only more questions. Rumor has it there will be a part two. And the sooner, the better.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
