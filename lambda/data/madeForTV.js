    "review":"After returning home from prison, Hoover J comes to the open arms of his family and gang. While filling up at a gas station, someone shoots J's car multiple times.  He runs to Leon at the Family Helpline to get his car out of the impound lot.  Before J goes to see Leon, Beverly, the associate director, runs interference before Joanne, the new intern can intervene. While waiting, Joanne talks to J and exchanges phone numbers with him.  He offers to show her an authentic look at Compton.  Joanne grew up a far cry from Compton in an affluent suburb.  While she works full-time for a game show, she wants to do something more meaningful with her time. Joanne meets J for lunch and listens to his ideas about improving the neighborhood.  She thinks he could be an asset to Leon, but Leon won't hire him. After turning down Joanne's request to hire J, Leon forbids her to see J again.  She takes Leon's advice with a grain of salt and uses it to fuel her next campaign with J by her side and in her heart.<br/><br/>As Shakespeare wrote, \"These violent delights have violent ends,\" and you wait for the impending doom to come.  As the world tries to pull them apart, it pushes them into each others' arms for safety and comfort.  With that said, the film progressed slowly and dedicated its time to justifying Joanne's actions instead of solidifying J's aspirations.  Hopefully, this movie and J's words can get others to change their actions and be a beacon for hope.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
