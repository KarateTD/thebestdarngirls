    "review":"The Fallen Angels book club convenes and discusses their latest book selection.  While this looks like an ordinary book club to some, the club members have one thing in common: their parole officer, Jerry.  Hollis and her friends, Rena, Gene, Rory, Abby, and Miller, are ex-cons.  But Hollis proclaims that she took the fall for her ex-husband, Bill.  While the outside world judges them, they believe in each other.<br/><br/>After discussing their latest book, Rory invites everyone to his home for cigars and drinks.  Everyone but Hollis says yes, but Rory persuades her to join them.  They laugh, smoke, and drink, but something about Rory's most expensive cigars catches Hollis's eye.  They remind Hollis of the cigars Bill smoked.  Hollis demands to know how Rory got the cigars, but he refuses to answer.  Then he politely but firmly tells Hollis to go home.<br/><br/>Hollis, Gene, Rena, Abby, and Miller wait for Rory at their next book club.  So they are happy when the doors open but shocked to see who comes through.  It's Detectives Faber and Lincoln.  They came to find information and clues about who poisoned and killed Rory.  The information dumbfounds Rory's friends.  After the detectives question all of them and retreat, Hollis remembers that Rory's murder mirrors the one from the book they're reading.  Hollis and the Fallen Angels book club will need to work together to clear their name and find justice for Rory.<br/><br/>This film can be the start of an intriguing series.  Like several H.M.M. franchises, they have compelling connections and a drive to solve crimes.  However, these characters have more complex backstories that only Lifetime can provide.  With interesting anti-heroes, this movie attracts anyone who needs or believes in second chances.  Also, the mystery gives viewers lots of suspects, red herrings, a decent body count, and the start of the next chapter.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lacy got a call from her boss, Sharon.  Sharon needs Lacy to fill in for a high-profile job.  Famous actor Desmond Gage needs an assistant while preparing for a role.  Desmond is a method actor, and he needs to live the part to give it life.  Lacy takes the job because she wants to make it big in Hollywood.  On her first night, Lacy introduces herself and prepares for the night.  But she starts to dream about Desmond.  During the day, Desmond is sweet, caring, and aloof.  At night, he is passionate and unhinged.  Desmond's script has his character falling madly in love with a woman.  What will Lacy do when his obsession becomes real and dangerous.<br/><br/>Lacy is one of the most unsympathetic characters in a Lifetime movie.  She keeps making the same naive mistake, and it's infuriating.  At certain moments, you start to think Lacy is unstable.  The saving grace in this film is the last 10 minutes.  Desmond gets an explanation about his actions.  Watch this movie at the risk of your sanity.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A bruised and battered Gena wakes up to see Quadir next to her.  He explains that he woke up in a private hospital after flatlining.  The only people who knew he was alive were his mother, Carlos, and his nurse, Maria.  Quadir planned to get better, have Carlos fly Gena to L.A., and watch her until he healed.  After that, Quadir wanted to meet her and fly away together.  But that plan came to an end when he saw Jerrell attack Gina.  Now, Quadir desires to stay in hiding until Gena's bruises heal.  Then, they can leave together with the money.<br/><br/>In Philadelphia, Jerrell's brother, Terrell, got out of jail.  Terrell decides to walk back to the neighborhood and take over Jerrell's operation.  While in L.A., Jerrell asked Saleem to find the snitch.  Saleem takes a hard look at the crew but still wants payback for the robbery.  Knowing something is wrong, Alia and Shoog beg Bria to cut Dalvin out of her life.  But when Dalvin comes to the house with Gucci shoes and Twizzlers, Bria can't say no.<br/><br/>Titus is the snitch, and he is working with Detective Joe.  Joe owes $40,000 to dangerous people.  Joe has 48 hours to get the money, or he will die.<br/><br/>In a state of bliss, Gena has no plans to return until Bria reaches out for help.  After a fight, Bria accidently shot Dalvin.  She calls Gena to help her.  Gena decides to return but tells Quadir not to come for his safety.  Quadir adheres to her request but says he will join her if she doesn't return in 72 hours.  Gena's presence will be the gasoline on an inferno that will leave a trail of ashes.<br/><br/>Based on True the Game Part III by Teri Woods and the sequel to True to the Game 2, this movie has all the blood and torture of an old-school gangster film.  You get every tooth-pulling detail set to the juxtaposition of Cameo playing in the background.  While the music choices are reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs, the story leaves viewers with more questions than answers.  This film represents the last book in the franchise.  With fans' questions, will it be the last movie?<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Angie sits at home with her little sister, Maddie, and waits for their parents.  Once again they are late, so Angie has to miss the party.  The next day, Angie walks with Maddie.  Maddie says she wants ice cream, so Angie pulls out her ukelele and sings for money.  Mario walks up to her and requests a song for $5.  When Mario spots Angie in the park again, he tells her he has an uncle that hires singers.<br/><br/>After her school recital, Angie's parents forget to attend or pick her up.  So Angie calls Mario.  Mario tells Angie he will take her home, but his uncle resides down the street and wants to hear her sing.  Angie walks into a room with Deacon and Ida .  Ida puts some makeup on Angie to add a pop of color, and Deacon walks her to the back.  As Angie starts to play for Rob, Deacon turns on a camera and leaves the room.  Rob gets up and sexually assaults Angie.  When Angie wakes up, Ida names her Angel and threatens to expose her assault if Angie tries to leave.  Angie is a victim of human trafficking, and escaping will only be 10% of the battle.<br/><br/>For survivors, some scenes can be triggering.  This movie stands out because it doesn't give a flowering end to escaping this modern-day slavery.  You witness survivors struggling with reconnecting with family, working with the police, and finding their voice.  And with physical or mental threats, some go back to their captors.  This movie is honest because everyone doesn't have a happy, clean-cut ending.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
