    "mtitle":"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff: The Kristine Carlson Story",
    "review":"Kristine sits in a car and tries to figure out what she got herself into by agreeing to write the Don't Sweat the Small Stuff book for women, but her husband, Richard, has confidence in her abilities.  After a segment on Oprah, Richard's books spent weeks at number one.  Kristine will have to get over her fear of public speaking to attend book tours, but she will handle that with Richard by her side.  That is until someone calls her.  A doctor in New York informs Kristine that Richard \"expired\" of a pulmonary embolism. She attempts to grieve with her daughters, Jazzy and Kenna, but the media and fans bombard Richard's private wake. Then Richard's publisher, Zach, calls.  They want Kristine to take over for Richard and write the book. Kristine starts to panic because she is not ready.  While Kristine deals with issues, she tries to motivate Jazzy and Kenna to keep Richard's dreams for their future going.  However, Jazzy and Kenna pull away from school and Kristine.  Kristine, Jazzy, and Kenna have to come together to survive the emotional, physical, and literal storm coming.<br/><br/>Based on Heartbroken Open: A True Story of Coming Alive Again After Profound Loss by Kristine Carlson, this movie shows how one family can triumph when they open up about their pain and stand together.  Bullying, selective mutism, and a child are only half of what this family goes through after Richard dies.  When they survive everything and bring their life together, you think that's the end of the movie.  But it's not.  The family is one more unexpected but familiar issue to overcome at a foreseen time of happiness.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
