    "review":"On a flight home, Alicia can't help but notice her seatmate's computer screen with a coffin website. She walks over to her friend, Nicole, who asks her to work. Alicia laughs at Nicole and reminds Nicole that she is a passenger today, not a flight attendant. Alicia decides to hide in the bathroom while Nicole grabs her things and moves them to another seat.<br/><br/>Daniel notices 'Hello' playing on her music device. He says hello and points to it. She laughs and explains that Hello is her 'rock bottom song.' Daniel says that 'Lose Yourself' is his. They talk for a while, and he asks her out on a date. She tells him it's New Year's Eve, and she has plans.<br/><br/>Outside of her apartment, Alicia hears Ms. Valentine practicing Auld Lang Syne for her wild New Year's party. Ms. Valentine's nephew, Officer Stephen, invites Alicia to the party. But being in a room full of police is not ideal for Alicia. Her ex-boyfriend, Troy, was a drug dealer and was murdered in prison. Ms. Valentine asks if she could store some extra champagne in Alicia's home, and Alicia happily obliges. Alicia gets restless and calls Daniel after some liquid courage supplied by Ms. Valentine. Daniel says yes and tells Alicia to meet him at a local restaurant.<br/><br/>After being an hour late, Daniel tells Alicia to stop with her attitude and chill. He was with his ailing mother and couldn't get to a phone. She understands, and they have a magnificent date. While Alicia slips into something more comfortable, Daniel puts on music. Alicia comes down in a red teddy and suggests a different song. Daniel understands it's emotional because Troy played it on their first date. Alicia stops in her tracks because she never mentioned her ex-boyfriend's name. Daniel knocks Alicia out with an elbow to the face. Alicia wakes up tied to a chair, and Daniel has one question: Where are Troy's diamonds? If Alicia doesn't tell him, he will kill her and anyone who tries to help her.<br/><br/>This movie will have you on pins and needles when Daniel hits Alicia. Everything before that helps set a running clock for Daniel to get the information from Alicia. And you have to watch until the end for the fully satisfying conclusion. The fight scenes, twists, and conclusion were all perfect. And the movie doesn't end with the romantic cinema cliché.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Shy Sky is returning to traditional education after being homeschooled for years. Sky's mom, Nicole, drops Sky off, and Sky runs into an old friend, Marnie. As they walk the campus, Heather, a basketball player, approaches along with her teammates. Sky loves computers and programming. Sky smiles and offers to tutor, but Heather only wants answers. Sky refuses to cheat, and Heather warns Sky not to cross her or other basketball players. For the rest of the day, Sky is alone and anxious. Marnie and Sky come to the practice, and Heather haphazardly says that Sky has computer skills next to their coach, Sandy. Heather thinks Sky would be the best replacement for their score and stat keeper, Sherri. Sandy agrees and makes Sky a member of the basketball team.<br/><br/>Sky enjoys her newfound friendship and all its perks. During a study session, Marnie gives Sky a bag of clothes. Marnie tells Sky that the girls give her clothes to sell on the dark web for Bitcoins. Clueless Sky replaced Sherri's role in a shoplifting ring after Sherri's disappearance. And the girls aren't giving their clothes away. They are stealing them using elaborate yet low-tech ruses. No one knows the puppet master amongst them or how high up it goes.<br/><br/>This movie mixes The Bling Ring and The Pregnancy Pact with mystery sprinkled into it. The script uses the mystery of Sherri's disappearance to keep you watching. The writer cleverly made everyone despicable, causing you to second-guess all of them except Sky and Nicole. Viewers will piece together all the clues you miss when the script reveals the mastermind. The motive is lackluster, but the mystery is compelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mindy's 50th birthday is in 10 days, and she is not handling it well. Mindy chooses to day drink and shop instead. Mindy's car breaks down on the way home. Sam walks by and offers comfort, but Mindy says no. Then she looks up and sees it's her high school sweetheart, Sam. Sam sits and catches up with the divorcée, but they part ways before exchanging numbers.<br/><br/>Mindy's daughter, Rita, is coming to town with Rita's girlfriend, Emily. Rita is 23 and dropped out of school, much to her parent's disappointment. Mindy divorced Mark 2 years ago after he left to find himself. Since then, he started dating someone new that is similar to her.<br/><br/>Emily and Rita arrive to plan Mindy's party, but Mindy tells them she is not in the mood to celebrate her birthday. Then, Emily's uncle enters. And to Mindy's surprise, Emily's uncle is Sam. Rita wants to buy an RV, go to Burning Man, and marry Emily. As Mindy spends more time with Sam, she decides to make drastic changes and have fun with her life. Mindy enjoys her mid-life crisis with Sam until she gets a human reality check: her ex-husband, Mark. Rita invited Mark to attend the surprise engagement. However, he wants Mindy back, Sam gone, and Rita in school.<br/><br/>Let's start by being honest: Rita and Mindy are adults. So telling their parents anything is a courtesy, not asking permission. However, this movie is about Mindy finding herself and seeing her mistakes. She eats what she wants, discovers new things, and finds her first love. Enjoy this entertaining watch with a nice bottle of wine, but expect some lulls throughout the script.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Also, Jamie works with Karina to find her voice. While Karina is accepting, Darren resists. Can Jamie help Darren, or will Ivy's life come crashing down on them?<br/><br/>This movie is Marry Me combined with bad lip-syncing, no wedding, and an average plot.

This movie is your best option for background noise for two hours.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Naomi and Simon ask a server to bring champagne to celebrate their announcements. First, they want their best friends, Jack and Barrett, to be the best man and maid of honor at their wedding. Next, they are moving up their engagement party and wedding to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the day they met.<br/><br/>Ten years ago, Naomi took Barrett to one of Jack's concerts, and Barrett dismissed Jack and his pop music, especially his hit song. Jack heard her comments and expressed she couldn't write something if she tried. Jack's manager, Simon, stepped in and offered to find Naomi something she could eat. And that's when Naomi and Simon met. However, Jack and Barrett have been at odds since that day. Jack worries that Barrett will nitpick over every detail and write everything in her notebook. Barrett worries that Jack won't take anything seriously. But they promise to put Naomi and Simon first.<br/><br/>Barrett plans the engagement party at Jack's home and gives him one job: the music. Then, Barrett gets an idea. Jack is a musician, and the happy couple loves his music. So she asks Jack to play. Jack hasn't played on stage in years, but Jack agrees to do it if Barrett sings with him.<br/><br/>Simon and Naomi think the best wedding gift Jack and Barrett can give them is a performance at their wedding. Jack isn't sure what to sing, but Naomi believes it should be an original song. Jack hasn't written anything in years, but Barrett is an English professor that writes poetry. Jack and Barrett agree to write an original song and perform it at the wedding for their friends. They will discover each other and themselves in their collaboration.<br/><br/>This musical tale is a slew of apologies wrapped in flashbacks. Viewers will see Barrett and Jack's first encounter through their viewpoints. Each perspective is hilarious and slanted in the narrator's favor. As Jack and Barrett reveal their struggles, they understand that they misconstrued each other from the beginning. The songs are divine, and Jack's relationship with his son, Teddy, is open and honest.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Sam runs the Wolf Creek Wildlife Refuge with the support of the town. She doesn't know if she can keep it open without more money. Sam's sister, Sunny, posts a video of Sam saving eagle eggs, and the video goes viral. Olivia runs the tristate animal protection fund. Olivia wants to visit the refuge tomorrow to see if it meets their criteria. Sam happily accepts the visit but panics because it needs a lot of improvements before Olivia's walkthrough.<br/><br/>Sam goes to the Wolf Creek hardware store to rent a drill, but someone checked it out earlier and won't return it until the afternoon. The hardware store's owner, Marietta, offers to drive it to the refuge after the renter returns it, and Sam graciously accepts her offer. After Sam leaves, a man, Calvin, comes for bullets, but the store doesn't sell them because Wolf Creek is a conservation town. Austin, Marietta's nephew, suggests Calvin go to the next city, and Calvin leaves. Austin offers to go to the refuge and deliver the drill because Marietta has macular degeneration.<br/><br/>Austin comes to the refuge and sees Sam working with a distressed horse. He offers to help and calms the animal. Then, George, a local merchant, runs to Sam. He accidently hit a wolf on the road. He tried to help, but the wolf ran off. If the alpha dies, it will devastate the entire wolf pack. Sam must find, examine, and possibly save the wolf if needed. Austin decides to go with Sam to cover more ground. It will take longer because Calvin is hunting the same wolf. The wolf's pelt is worth more than anything, including Sam and Austin's lives.<br/><br/>This movie is an adventure story with romance in the background. While Austin helps Sam track the wolf, they help each other conquer their fears. With a movie that has caves, yellow jackets, and a terrifying leap of faith, it isn't all doom and gloom. The writer interjects moments of humor to ease the tension. While entertaining the audience, the plot gently stresses the importance of conservation and lets Sam and Austin fall in love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
