    "mtitle": "Husband, Father, Killer: The Alyssa Pladl Story",
    "review": "Fifteen-year-old Alyssa meets twenty-one-year-old Steven in a chat room. Her parents force Alyssa to cease communicating with him, but Steven helps her run away from home. Soon, she is married and gives birth to a girl, Denise. Then, Alyssa sees his true colors. Steven rages when Denise cries. Alyssa gives Denise up for adoption to save her from Steven's abuse. Her adoptive parents have one condition: they change her name for a fresh start. Alyssa and Steven agree.<br/><br/>Seventeen years later, Steven can't keep a job and prides himself on being the fun dad. He and Alyssa have two daughters, Caroline and Jenna. Alyssa turns on the faucet, and nothing comes out. She threatens to pawn her ring for the money and get a divorce. She wishes she left with Denise instead of staying with him. Denise is now Katie. Before her parents serve breakfast, Katie tells them she wants to meet her biological parents. Anthony hesitates. But Kelly believes Katie should meet them. Katie finds Steven on Facebook and messages him. Steven runs to Alyssa and tells her with pride. Alyssa worries because of Steven's past abuse but invites Katie to stay with them for two weeks after her graduation.<br/><br/>Katie arrives with Anthony and Kelly. She is excited to meet her little sisters and biological parents. Katie and Alyssa spend time together and converse about the past. Steven becomes jealous. He tells Katie that Alyssa forced him to give her up and degraded him. Katie dreams of attending college, but Steven tells her that's a mistake. He says she can be an artist today and live with them until she starts her career. Within days, Steven lets Katie party, drink, and disrespect Alyssa. She decides to divorce Steven and take their daughters. However, Katie wants to stay. This fateful choice will lead to incest, child abuse, and three murders.<br/><br/>This movie is heartbreaking and feels unreal. Sadly, it's all true. Young Alyssa didn't understand that her parents tried to protect her from a manipulator. As she tells her story to a detective, Alyssa reveals that she left a lamb in a lion's den to fend for itself. It's disturbing to watch Steven use the same pick-up lines on Katie that he did with Alyssa. This film is a quintessential story of grooming, and the incest makes it worse. Everyone made mistakes, and three people paid the ultimate price. Viewers should watch this movie with their teens and open a dialogue.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "'Twas the Date Before Christmas",
    "review": "Jessie tells her sister-in-law, Shelly, about her string of horrible dates. Shelly wonders if Jessie intentionally picks the wrong men because she isn't over her former fianc√©, Shawn. Later, Jessie concludes her virtual team holiday party and prepares to put work aside for two weeks. Then, her mother, Laura, knocks. Jessie welcomes Laura, and they discuss the family's Christmas Eve festivities. Laura stops Jessie and gives her sad news. Aunt Lily decided to have the Christmas Eve dinner only. They don't believe Jessie is over Shawn and don't want to make Jessie sad. Jessie lies. She says she has a new boyfriend. Laura bounces and quickly exits to inform Lily. Jessie updates her online profile to say she's looking for a man for a blind Christmas date with her family.<br/><br/>Interim CEO Don tells his team he wants to evict their holdout before the new year. The tenet will cause significant delays in their affordable housing development. Bryan knows the company can't afford this but wonders if they could talk to the owner face-to-face. Don challenges Bryan to meet with the owner, but Bryan backs down. Bryan spends time with his friends, and they worry about him being alone for the holidays. So, Bryan's friend, Terry, grabs Bryan's phone and scrolls through a dating app. She finds Jessie's profile and likes her look. Bryan reads about the family gathering and likes the idea. They flirt via text messages, and Bryan accepts Jessie's invitation.<br/><br/>Before meeting Bryan, Jessie goes to Shelly's candle shop and reveals the truth. Shelly promises to keep Jessie's secret. Later, Jessie meets Bryan, and they drive to her parents' home. Laura and Jessie's stepdad, Marcus, greet Bryan with bear hugs. They pull him inside, and he meets Jessie's brother, Andrew. None of them are a match for Aunt Lily. She announces the start of the 23rd annual Chamberlain Family Christmas Olympics. Bryan can't wait to play.<br/><br/>After a game, Bryan goes outside to help Andrew with the lights. Andrew reveals that Shelly created the scents for the home. Bryan uncovers that Shelly is the holdout and will receive an eviction notice. He plans to fix it before Jessie learns the truth. The family chose not to reveal Jessie's past with Shawn. They want her to do it at her speed. And Jessie will keep the 'boyfriend' lie going. This year, the Chamberlains Family Christmas will be a hot mess.<br/><br/>Hallmark chose this movie to start the 2024 holiday movie lineup, and it's a solid film. It had terrific character growth, a genuine connection, comedic situations, and a heartfelt ending. Jessie looks forward to her family's traditions, so she lies to keep them going. Also, the plot doesn't immediately connect Bryan and Shelly. It allows them to build an honest friendship and understanding. As the audience gets familiar with the Chamberlains, you understand their concern stems from love. This film is easy-going, sincere, and fun.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Professor's Deadly Secret",
    "review": "Lauren is inconsolable as she caresses the gift her aunt Trish gave her. Professor Trish taught math at IMT and gave Lauren an engraved abacus. Lauren joins her parents, Helen and John, to honor Trish's life with the other mourners at Trish's wake. Later, Helen enters Lauren's room and sees Lauren's Math Summit application torn on the floor. The coroner reported that Trish died from a heart attack. Lauren states that Trish ran marathons, and the family has 0 history of heart problems. She deduces that someone killed Trish. Lauren doesn't have time for the summit because she will solve Trish's murder.<br/><br/>Lauren is lackluster in class until the new guest lecturer, Kristy, breathes new life into the class. Lauren goes to the market with Helen and criticizes Helen for not retrieving Trish's research journals. She steps away from Helen and rejoins her at the register. Lauren beams when she sees Kristy standing there. Helen sees the connection between Kristy and Lauren and invites Kristy to dinner.<br/><br/>Kristy plays peacemaker between Lauren and Kristy throughout the meal. Kristy mentions she was in the Math Summit, and John asks Kristy to tutor Lauren. Kristy accepts, and Lauren can barely contain her excitement. Helen hopes this will ease Lauren's life and help Lauren come to terms with Trish's passing. However, it will unlock two secrets Trish took to her grave.<br/><br/>This movie is The Big Bang Theory, with tears and two murders. Viewers who like bloody Lifetime movies should skip this film because it focuses on the growing connection between Lauren and Kristy. The script allows you to see why Lauren trusts Kristy more than Helen. If you can get past the crying, the movie simmers but picks up in the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Killer I Picked Up",
    "review": "Angela admits to her co-worker, friend DJ, that she doesn't have enough money to pay her daughter's future tuition. Angela's daughter, Brianna, plans to attend a great school, and Angela desires to help. So, Angela decided to be a rideshare driver.<br/><br/>Angela's first few rides are uneventful. She picks up a handsome rider named Aaron. Aaron thanks Angela for the ride and hopes he sees her again. She wants the same thing too. A few nights later, Angela picks up John. Angela arrives at his designated stop, but he won't leave and grabs her. Then, someone opens the back door and pulls John out. Angela jumps when she sees Aaron at her window. He saves her from John.<br/><br/>Angela and Brianna are shopping for food when Angela sees Aaron beside the frozen food fridge. Aaron introduces them to his nephew, Jason. Angela spies that Brianna is smitten with Jason. Brianna accepts a dinner date for Angela after Aaron asks. Angela sighs but looks forward to the night's events. The date goes well, but Aaron rubs her the wrong way sometimes. However, she overlooks it because he is smart, kind, and funny.<br/><br/>Over a few days, DJ warns Angela that her night job is negatively impacting her day job. She advises Angela to slow down. However, someone won't be happy if Angela is off the road. They want Angela and Brianna to themselves and will kill for them.<br/><br/>This movie is great for playing 'Spot the Red Flags.' Some are obvious, while others take time to notice. Angela overlooks the issues, but DJ doesn't. It takes time for Brianna to see them, but she immediately lays out her boundaries when she does. The plot is obvious, but the ride is fun. This movie maintains your attention for two hours, but it's not a classic.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Brian and Jane tour an abandoned asylum for the criminally insane to discover earth-bound ghosts. However, teacher Jane isn't finding any activity on her meters. She looks around the room and sees a heart of rose petals on the ground. Jane turns to Brian on a bent knee with a ring. Jane says yes.<br/><br/>Six months later, Jane kisses Brian goodbye. He will stay at their antique store while Jane, with her maid-of-honor, Rachel, prepares their venue for the wedding. Their venue is a haunted manor called Keystone Manor.<br/><br/>Proprietor Marianne begs a guest to stay as Jane and Rachel arrive. She explains that Angelique haunts the manor. Marianne cordoned off Angelique's old room and kept its contents the same to appease the ghost. Jane's curiosity takes over, and she enters the room after Marianne walks away. Jane finds Angelique's obituary. It states that Angelique was 26 at the time of her death and died on what would have been her wedding day. She looks around the room and finds a painting of Angelique and her fianc√©, Malcolm. Jane can't believe how much Malcolm resembles Brian.<br/><br/>Jane and Marianne sit on the front porch and sip beverages while discussing Angelique and Malcolm. Jane hears someone and assumes it's Marianne, but it's Angelique. For the first time, someone hears Angelique.<br/><br/>Brian rides to the manor with his best man, Steve. Brian desires to make Jane feel secure about their wedding. Her ex-fianc√©, Alec, left Jane on their wedding day and married another woman five months later. Brian plans to stay by Jane's side and help with the wedding while looking for ghosts.<br/><br/>Jane shows Brian Angelique's room and tells him Angelique's story. Angelique appears. To everyone's surprise, Brian and Jane can see her, and they will marry on the same day Angelique and Malcolm would have. Angelique explains that Malcolm died on his way to her. They will find Malcolm and bring him to her. When their first attempts fails, Angelique's rage boils over. She will doom their wedding day if she can't have her love. Jane and Brian must find Malcolm and bring him to her or risk losing their wedding.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic with series potential. Jane and Brian have the same passion but approach it differently. Jane uses the scientific method, but Brian goes with his gut. Angelique's character feels a smidge bratty, but be patient. And Jane and Brian's encounters with Malcolm are pure comedic gold. The writers pulled inspiration and tropes from your favorite paranormal TV shows and movies. So, keep your eyes and ears open.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
