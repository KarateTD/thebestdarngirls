    "mtitle":"Christmas in Notting Hill",
    "review":"Georgia flies to London to visit her sister, Lizzie. This visit is the first time they have seen each other in years. Lizzie promises to show Georgia a Notting Hill Christmas. Georgia looks forward to meeting Lizzie's boyfriend. Georgia reveals a secret to Lizzie before their father arrives.

Lizzie laughs in disbelief because she knows Georgia will make the safe and responsible choice: Indiana.<br/><br/>Soccer player Graham rewatches his injury video in rehab and worries about his future. Now, he agonizes that this injury will end it all. Graham meets his brother, Henry, at a local pub. Henry shocks Graham because Henry says he is ready to propose to his girlfriend. Graham worries Henry is moving too fast. Henry bolsters that he wants this, and Graham shouldn't be afraid to make changes in his life.<br/><br/>Lizzie takes Georgia to a Christmas market but has to leave early because her boss needs her. Georgia finds a beautiful hand-painted ornament that reminds her of her deceased mother. The shop owner lets her have it. Graham hides in his mother's booth at the Christmas market. Graham hastily leaves after taking pictures and signing autographs. He bumps into Georgia, causing her to drop her ornament and mess up her jacket. He wants to help and says she can clean up at his mother's home. She cleans up her jacket and exits the home. Graham believes he will never see the mysterious woman, who knows nothing about his fame, again. However, they are closer than they know.<br/><br/>This movie's storyline uses too much foreshadowing. Hallmarkies can piece the story together in the first 30 minutes. You will watch to confirm your hunches, not for entertainment. However, Georgia and Lizzie's bonding moments are cute and funny. Save this movie for background noise during your holiday decorating.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
