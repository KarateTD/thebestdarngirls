    "mtitle":"Mary J. Blige's Real Love",
    "review":"Kendra got a scholarship to attend Hammon College to the joy of her father. During Lift Every Voice and Sing, a student, Ben, approaches Kendra and asks for her number. She doesn't believe that he dares to interrupt this song. He explains that he has to do it because he is pledging a frat, and his big brother, Reggie, asked him to do it. Kendra laughs and confidently expresses her disinterest in Reggie.<br/><br/>Later, Kendra goes to the Bursar's office to apply for a job and sees Ben registering for classes. She talks about her passion for photography while Ben consistently puts his foot in his mouth. After Kendra leaves, Ben signs up for Intro to Photography. They make plans to see each other later. This choice will have a lasting impact on Kendra's education, safety, and love life.<br/><br/>Inspired by Real Love by Mary J. Blige, this movie hits on several issues in two hours. Kendra is a strong person with a good work ethic, but she is immature about love and how to navigate it. At first, Ben seems like a good catch. But he is stunted by his parent's expectations. Together, they learn that love is a journey with peaks and valleys. Part two can't come soon enough.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Betrayed By My Bridesmaid",
    "review":"Katie and her fianc√©, Tom, will spend one night with his mom, Mrs. Lin, before staying at their hotel. They will get married in one week, and Katie is excited. Mrs. Lin meets Katie and instantly dislikes her.<br/><br/>Katie and company go to the hotel and meet her other bridesmaids, Heather and Jamie. As they greet each other, Katie hears someone summon her from a distance. It's her sister, Connie. In the past, Connie got drunk and slept with Katie's boyfriend at Katie's birthday party. Since then, Katie hasn't spoken to Connie. Katie swallows her pride and accepts Connie into the wedding because Connie is the only family member Katie has left. Katie will regret her decision to trust Connie, get married, and have fun after a string of unfortunate incidences.<br/><br/>This film proves that everyone sucks. Katie is a disrespectful bride who makes everyone prove how much they love her. Connie is a succubus. Tom and Heather are cowards, and Amanda's a jerk. If that isn't enough, Mrs. Lin is the evil mother-in-law. Also, the final fight scene is a laugh riot. If you watch this movie, be prepared for an annoying but funny ride.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Danger Below Deck",
    "review":"Melanie stands outside the club, hoping to get in, but the bouncer says they are at capacity. Melanie goes to the back of the club and sneaks inside. Melanie tries to blend in, but Jules spots her. However, Jules doesn't rat her out because he likes her tenacity. Melanie meets Chloe and thinks Chloe is glamorous. Chloe is an influencer who promotes parties. While Chloe's life looks aspirational, Melanie doesn't recognize the trouble around Chloe. Soon, Chloe leaves the club after seeing a scary man watching her across the room.<br/><br/>Jules texts Chloe with a job offer, but she turns it down. Chloe sees the same scary man outside her apartment and runs out the back door. However, he catches up to Chloe and demands she pay the $40,000 she owes. Chloe takes Jules's job and contacts Melanie to work with her. Melanie sees this job as a godsend because Melanie's boss fired her for texting during work. Melanie wants to help her father pay bills and her education. They will cruise and document themselves on social media with hashtags and location pins. The free trip is fast money for Chloe and Melanie. But all money isn't good money.<br/><br/>Melanie's once-in-a-lifetime adventure leads her into a torrid world of smuggling, drugs, and violence. This cautionary tale drags as the plot sets up the background characters as Chloe and Melanie dance, take pictures, and drink. Viewers will predict the ending because it's a Lifetime movie. But they will all be wrong. This conclusion saves the film because it's dripping with honesty. One poor decision will change the course of your life forever.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Weding Wish",
    "review":"Jenny tells her friend, Billy, that she found the perfect lighting for her wedding. She can't wait to get married on her 35th birthday, as Madam Lotus predicted. Billy takes a deep breath and explains the flaw in Jenny's plan. She's single. Jenny refuses to believe she won't be married in 3 months. She booked a caterer, bought a dress, and sent invitations to family and friends. Then she gets a call from Carmen, an event manager. The Spanish Monastery Jenny booked wants to meet her and her husband to cement the date. Jenny tells Carmen her husband is a deep sea diver, but he will meet when he returns. Carmen gives Jenny two days to visit with her husband, or she will offer the date to another couple.<br/><br/>Jenny sits at Billy's receptionist desk while Billy talks to his boss, Clara. A man, Tyler, enters while talking on the phone about his next meeting. He doesn't hold back his resentment for the illustrator Clara hired for his new book. Clara exits her office and introduces Tyler to his new illustrator Jenny. Clara wants Tyler and Jenny to work together, but they dislike each other's work. She thinks his books are silly and shallow, and he believes her illustrations aren't kid friendly. Tyler's last book didn't sell well, and Jenny's art can advance his writing. Jenny leaves the meeting, and Tyler overhears her booking dilemma at the monastery. He offers to be her stand-in if she illustrates his next book. Tyler thinks Jenny's preparation is wild but bends backward to help her, including finding her future husband. Will this stand-in bring Jenny a husband?<br/><br/>Ok, what is this? Jenny is 100% delusional, and her friends go along with it. This movie is a study of shared psychotic disorder. Her delusion becomes sad, pathetic, and annoying. If Lifetime aired this film, she would be an insane stalker, not a dreamer. The conclusion tries to redeem the movie with Jenny's discovery of self-love, but it's too little too late.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars.",
