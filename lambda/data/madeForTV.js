    "mtitle":"The Twisted Twin",
    "review":"Before Tess's college freshman orientation, she notices someone is following her.  She hides in the bathroom.  Once she hears the footsteps leave, she exits the stall.  A figure in a hoodie jumps up and tells her not to scream. Sammy, Tess's twin, introduces herself.  Years ago, Mitch and Kim adopted Sammy because they only wanted one child.  Days later, Patricia adopted Tess.  However, Patricia was never told Tess was a twin. Sammy invites Tess to stay the night at her parents' mansion.  Tess wakes to her clothes missing and a note from Sammy.  Sammy decided to switch places to help Tess with her Spanish exam.  She tells Tess to enjoy the switch and be the best Sammy she can be.  Damon sees Tess and starts to kiss her, assuming she is Sammy.  Then he sees the housekeepers approaching.  He tells Tess to get rid of them.  She tries but she just can't keep them out.  Soon, one of the housekeepers makes a blood-curdling scream.  They found Sammy's parents dead inside the home.  Tess can't believe it.  The police come to investigate.  Tess tries to explain that she is not Sammy.   However, they can't find the note Sammy left her. When Patricia and Sammy, posing as Tess, denied they knew about the twin, Tess knows her mom is in danger.  Tess will do anything to save her mom and Sammy will do anything to stay out of jail.  Who will prevail?<br/><br/>While the ending is a bit sappy, kudos for having intelligent cops in a Lifetime movie.  These cops don't take things at face value and work their investigation.  Lorynn York did a great job of making Sammy and Tess different.  She changed her voice pattern, her walk, and her glare to keep the characters divergent.  Special effects and a body double allowed their interactions to be coherent. And the gun standoff was everything you didn't know you wanted.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Basketball County: In the Water",
    "review":"Prince George's County Maryland is the heartbeat of the state.  Right outside of Washington, DC it's separated by the Capital Beltway.  However, basketball brings it all together.  With 30 NBA players, scores of WNBA players, and countless NCAA players, some believe there is something in the water.  This documentary follows basketball's start from James Naismith's invention of the game to Dr. Edwin Henderson bringing it to DC.  In P.G. County, the love of basketball was nurtured by the best park system in the nation.  Then DeMatha's newly appointed coach, Morgan Wooten, made a revolutionary decision to integrate his team and create one of the best high school programs to date.  As you watch, you will see how indoor basketball courts, Go-Go, trials and tribulations, and the prodigal son made P.G. County the Mecca a basketball.<br/><br/>Disclaimer, this reviewer is from P.G. County - as the locals call it - so the story of basketball and the county is deeply personal. This documentary is a heartfelt and honest look at the county and how it quickly recognized the important role basketball plays to the community's youth.  The county has built countless basketball courts and community centers to protect the youth from the ails of the community. This is a story of P.G.'s love of basketball.  Also, its basketball's love letter to the county that has given so much greatness to the game.  You will wish it was longer.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Andy leaves his war correspondent duties and heads home to visit his mom's Forest Cove B and B.  Before he arrives, his friend tells him the B and B is falling apart.  After Andy fixes a few items, he finds overdue bills Helen hid in a dresser drawer.  Without enough revenue, she won't be able to pay the electric bill, let alone the fixes.  Producer Diane travels to the Shangri-La resort to prep for the Jaunts with Jared TV show.  She tries to make a U-turn and gets her car stuck in the dirt.  Helen sees the sad, soaking wet Diane and allows her to stay the night for free.  Won over by her hospitality and hot cocoa, Diane fires up her laptop and starts writing.  Only Diane's best friend, Gina, knows Diane is the woman behind the blog, E-Dining with Edina. When Jared, the host and Diane's ex-boyfriend, calls for a new show idea, Diana pitches Forest Cove instead of Shangri-La.  He wants to destroy the B and B on air to get higher ratings. She makes Jared an offer.  If she can fix a list of problems, he will give the hotel a nice review.  Well, at least that's what he says.  While Diane works with Andy to get the fixes done, she doesn't know that he is planning to sell the B and B.  Can Diane change Andy and Jared's heart about the Forest Cove B and B?<br/><br/>This movie is background noise.  The premise, subplots, and conclusions have all been done.  This movie is 3 Hallmark movies in one. The most watchable aspects are Jared's snarky remarks and Helen's love life evolving.  Everything else can be skipped about this movie.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Two years ago, Jackson won a state Senate seat.  Before he starts campaigning again, he and girlfriend Aubrey are going on a vacation to Bermuda.  For Aubrey, this is a babymoon. At dinner, Aubrey brings up the subject of meeting his mom but Jackson isn't ready. The next morning, they sit poolside and Aubrey starts to feel ill.  She tells Jackson to stay while she lays down in the room.  Hours later, she wakes up to find Jackson is still gone.  She tries to text him, call him, and look for him.  But no luck. Finally, she calls the police and files a missing person's report. Out of the blue, Aubrey gets an email from Jackson.  He has left Bermuda and gone home.  He felt like they are moving too fast and he wants some space.  Aubrey is devastated and the police call off the search.  But something doesn't sit right with Aubrey. Aubrey goes to the lobby to get more information and a woman introduces herself.  Her name is Rose and she is Jackson's mother. Rose believes Jackson is with the woman he truly loves.  Only one name comes to Aubrey's mind: Samantha. Aubrey will make deals with the devil to find Jackson and get out of hell.<br/><br/>You have to give your full attention to this movie.  It has flashbacks within flashbacks. And keep your eye on the bottom left side of your screen to get the date of the flashbacks.  This will make the twist much more revealing.  With Jackson's letter, a bloody bathroom floor, and an ex-girlfriend, you get a fun mystery of what happened to Jackson.  Soon, you will start questioning Aubrey. And in case you are wondering, The Bermuda Indenture and The Expectant Father are real books.  In films like this, a change of characters' appearances would have help with the flashbacks.  So stick with this movie for a good climax and a strong payoff at the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
