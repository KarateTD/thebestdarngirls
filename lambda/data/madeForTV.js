    "review": "Gangster Rapper Charlie Mega spends three months in Fulton Jail. During her time, she went viral and spent time in Peachtree City of Faith's bible study. Charlie exits the jail and gets into an awaiting black SUV. Charlie approaches her front door. Before she can enter, her manager, Dean, rolls up on the property. Dean warns Charlie that she is behind for her next album, and she has to do community service.<br/><br/>After a restless night, Charlie attends Peachtree City of Faith Church, and Pastor Kyrus captivates her. She arrives later for her community service, and Doris yells at her for being late. Doris gives her a package to deliver to the church, and Charlie bangs on the door. Pastor Kyrus asks if she's lost, and Charlie laughs. She's lost in more ways than one. Something inside her has changed, but she's afraid to follow it. Kyrus encourages her to keep going and attend church.<br/><br/>Later, the Pastor meets with Deacon Kevin and Sister Suzanne. Kyrus wants to move the church to a larger location because the lease on his current building will expire soon. However, he can't collect enough donations from the current members. Suzanne highlights another issue. His single status is a problem for the church board. They want a sweet, church-going woman in the front row to be first lady. However, Kyrus can't take his mind off of Charlie. When they connect, they reflect the best parts of each other. Can their love hold when everyone tries to tear it down?<br/><br/>This movie is the surprise hit you don't see coming. While the world sees Kyrus and Charlie as opposites, they are the same. The writers use this inner conflict to express their connection, not lust. And that jumps off the film with faith and prayer. Eagle-eyed viewers will see their favorites from their treasured church dramas. The music is a 'bop,' and the fashion blends perfectly. This picture will be your favorite of Terry McMillan's.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Soldier for Christmas",
    "review": "After several failed dates, Hannah is tired of men on dating apps. Her friends and family encouraged her to date after losing her husband, Andrew, in battle. Sadly, her dates run when they discover she has a 5-year-old daughter, Carmen. Hannah expresses her frustrations with her brother, Joshua, during their daily check-in. Joshua is in the military and stationed overseas. Hannah chooses to focus on work. She has a campaign that needs a perfect all-American soldier. Hannah volunteers at church, and a co-worker, Jackie, says her daughter mentioned a Christmas wish to the congregation. Hannah inquires about the wish, but Jackie won't elaborate.<br/><br/>An RPG strikes near Joshua, but Ryan tackles him out of the way. Joshua wakes in a medical hospital with Ryan by his side. He thanks Ryan for saving him and gets an idea. He calls Hannah and says he found the perfect soldier for her. She assumes it's a date and says no. He reiterates and says it's for her campaign. She agrees, and Joshua introduces Ryan. Hannah can't contain her surprise but offers to interview him for the job later. Ryan will be a wish come true for Hannah, but can she accept it, or will her fears creep in?<br/><br/>Unlike other holiday films, you don't have to wait for the end for the main characters to become a couple. Ryan and Hannah became a couple before Ryan returned to his tour. The writers skirted the line between making Hannah expressive and whiny. The director shot some scenes in a gym. Often, the background becomes louder when the actors aren't speaking. The sound engineers expertly avoided this issue. Because this is a holiday movie, the religious and magical elements go hand-in-hand. It doesn't bombard or slow down the story. This film is a sweet, magical holiday story for the entire family.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Relative Danger",
    "review": "Alice hides in the closet and calls her mother, Angie, on the phone. She is alone and heard footsteps in the house. Angie picks up the call, assuming Alice will question her whereabouts. Instead, Angie hears the panic in Alice's voice. She tells Alice to be quiet and call the police. Then, Alice screams as her aunt, Sydney, opens the door and says boo. In that moment, Angie was the victim of a hit and run driver.<br/><br/>Detective Marshall meets Alice and Sydney at the hospital. Angie is alive, but she has severe head trauma. The staff put her in a medically induced coma to give her brain time to heal. Marshall recounts what he believed happened in the parking lot, but something sounds off to Sydney. Sydney thinks it was deliberate. Marshall asks if Angie had any enemies, but Sydney can't recall.<br/><br/>Sydney stands in the room alone with Angie as Nurse Simon enters. He can't believe this happened on a night he took her shift. Sydney does a double-take. She thought Angie was working a double shift that night. Simon admits that Angie was going to meet with Alice's dad. Sydney thought Alice's father had died years ago. Simon says Alice's father is alive and well, and his name is Jordan.<br/><br/>Sydney runs to her mother, Louise, for an explanation. Louise tells Sydney that Jordan was a drunk and a criminal. Sydney states that Jordan was with Angie the night of the accident. Louise thinks Jordan is the number one suspect and alerts Marshall. Alice is in danger, but do they have the right suspect?<br/><br/>This movie will make you feel bad for the bratty teen. Poor Alice was born into a world of liars, killers, and manipulators. This film delivers a compelling mystery for the first hour as you peel back the layers of Angie's life. That changes when Jordan's family enters the script. The villain stands out like a sore thumb, but you won't care. Their crazy ways will make you chuckle. It's worth watching and will make you want more. The culprit saved this picture.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Mother Looked Just Like You",
    "review": "Tennis Camp Owner Sharon trains students and runs a thriving business. She checks over the equipment when Cara asks if her name is familiar. Sharon says they have the same maiden name, but she doesn't know anyone named Cara. Cara asks if Sharaon knew her mother, Diane. Sharon freezes because Diane is her identical twin sister. They haven't seen each other in 20 years. Cara somberly informs Sharon that Diane died. Cara has no other family. Sharon tells Cara that she must discuss this with her husband, Ben, first.<br/><br/>Sharon runs to Ben's office and updates him. He worries that Cara is a con artist. However, Cara had Diane's ID, birth certificate, and their mother's wedding band. Ben wants Cara to get a blood test to prove her genealogy. Later, the family settles when the test proves Cara is their kin. But they shouldn't ease into family barbecues too soon. Cara plans to destroy every member of their family. She wants to make Sharon pay.<br/><br/>This film feels like they typical long-lost-family-gone-crazy story, but the plot adds one more twist. This surprise closes all the gaps in the story along the way. The family is kind and loving, with everyday squabbles. Ben is an intelligent and attentive Lifetime dad. He is Captain Obvious of the script. The audience will praise his common sense and logical thinking. He is the dreamboat of this film. You shouldn't cancel plans to watch this film, but give it a chance if you have two hours to kill.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Newport Christmas",

Her father has something pressing to tell Ella, but she is nowhere to be found on the property. Ella burst through the door with grand ideas. She wants to use her wedding dowry to create a charity for underprivileged families in Newport.<br/><br/>Ella tells Arthur about her idea, and he scoffs at it. He has plans for the ball. He will announce her engagement to Everett Thornton. He comes from a good family and will secure her future. Ella sneaks away, jumps on her boat, and floats to the middle of the sea. She sees a comet in the sky and makes a wish. Ella wishes for a different life, to fall in love, and to have someone fall in love with the real her.

Nick tells her that her family home is a museum. But she can't sleep at the museum. So they give her a room at the bed and breakfast. With each passing day, they notice that Ella's history is slowly disappearing. She must return to her time to make her impact on the world. There is only one problem. Nick is falling in love with her, knowing she will marry another man in her timeline. Can Nick let her go, or will he tear a fabric in time?<br/><br/>This beautifully written movie is funny and whimsical. Ella was a woman ahead of her time. The audience will dream of a world of Ella and Nick while they fall in love. Also, you will delight in Ella's wonderment. The writers made Back to the Future jokes and offered a subplot romance. They also found a way to praise both eras without diminishing the other. The vanity and set departments wove both eras together with ease and grace. It is a pleasure to witness their work. This film will make you wish for time travel and unending love.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
