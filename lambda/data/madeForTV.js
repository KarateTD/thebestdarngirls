Not knowing that Rob and Becky met recently, Jen sets them up on a blind date.  They become inseparable.  But when Jen and her boyfriend Chris sees Rob's dark side, can they save Becky?<br/><br/>Lifetime has done plenty of teen abuse movies but this is the first time they have delved into why someone has control issues.  Rob's history of abandonment, abuse, and alcoholism isn't an excuse but it does give an understanding of why he needs control.  Also, Becky overlooks Rob's issues until he hits her.  Unlike most Lifetime movie, one hit is enough.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie is what happens when someone takes the crazy train to self-help.
