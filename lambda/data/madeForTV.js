        "mtitle": "The College Admissions Scandal",
        "review": "Bethany and Caroline want the best for their children.  Bethany wants her daughter Emma to go to Yale.  Caroline wants her son Danny to go to Stanford.  Emma and Danny have natural talents but they don't have the grades or SAT scores to get into the Ivy League.  They turn to Rick Singer.  He coaches the kids in practical methods at first.  When that doesn't work, he tells the women about the side door to the admissions process.  This side door includes bribery, special test proctors, and psychologist.  While these moms see the side door as a new preference, they have no idea of the lives and institutions they will damage.  Including their children.<br/><br/>Based on true events, this movie will make you sick to your stomach as each mom justifies her actions.  You will have sympathy for Danny because his parents left him in the dark about the side door while ignoring his true passion.  Emma will get less sympathy because she was complacent in the deceit.  If you are looking for the story of Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, this isn't the movie for you.  Try American Greed.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review": "Karen found the love of her life twice.  First, with her deceased husband and now with David.  The icing on the cake: David and her daughter Annie get along beautifully.  So, they are both rocked when David dies in a plane crash.  While grieving, Karen gets a call that her mortgage is 2 months behind.  She is confused because she paid off the mortgage with her first husband's life insurance policy.  But the bank manager has the document with her signature and David filed it.  She can't believe that David would betray her.  When she discovers her 401K, CDs, and Annie's collge fund are all gone, she has to find the truth.  Good thing she will hear it all from David's mouth.<br/><br/>You must root for the killer to enjoy this movie.  The overall plotline makes you furious.  Karen is the perfect victim and molds her daughter to be the same.  But lookout, the writers left the plot open to a part 2.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

        "review": "After her husband's murder, Sharon is getting her life back on track by going to work.  She wants her son Anthony to have the same peace of mind but he is getting picked on in school.  Anthony is bullied every day by Brent until Dylan steps in to help.  The two become fast friends and Dylan encourages Anthony to try out for football.  Anthony decides to have a pool party and his mother is elated he has made friends.  During the party, Dylan purposely gets lost and Sharon finds him.  The two kiss.  This kiss is the beginning of Dylan's plan for revenge.<br/><br/>This plotline is overdone and can be pulled apart the moment Dylan is on screen.  And Sharon's battle cry is a cheap grab for female viewer support.  It is 1.5 hours of build-up for a lackluster climax.  This movie can be skipped.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review": "Angie \"Dove\" Columba is a matchmaker on a popular TV show.  Six months after matching Aaron and Emma, Aaron wants to propose on air.  Angie is elated and gets an invite to the engagement party.  At the party, Angie notices Emma is acting stressed.  Also, Aaron is a no-show.  Then Angie looks up to see Emma, falling down the stairs.  Emma is dead.  Angie will use her keen sense to help Detective Carter solve the case.<br/><br/>This new series gives H.M.M's loyal viewers a more complex character with Angie Dove.  She is an adopted child to recently separated parents.  Her father is a retired detective and her mother is a free spirit.  It will be interesting to see how these dynamics play out in the future.  Now, the mystery is classic Hallmark in the best way possible.  You have plenty of suspects with sketchy behavior and strong motives.  You will be second-guessing your guesses to the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
