    "review":"On a flight home, Alicia can't help but notice her seatmate's computer screen with a coffin website. She walks over to her friend, Nicole, who asks her to work. Alicia laughs at Nicole and reminds Nicole that she is a passenger today, not a flight attendant. Alicia decides to hide in the bathroom while Nicole grabs her things and moves them to another seat.<br/><br/>Daniel notices 'Hello' playing on her music device. He says hello and points to it. She laughs and explains that Hello is her 'rock bottom song.' Daniel says that 'Lose Yourself' is his. They talk for a while, and he asks her out on a date. She tells him it's New Year's Eve, and she has plans.<br/><br/>Outside of her apartment, Alicia hears Ms. Valentine practicing Auld Lang Syne for her wild New Year's party. Ms. Valentine's nephew, Officer Stephen, invites Alicia to the party. But being in a room full of police is not ideal for Alicia. Her ex-boyfriend, Troy, was a drug dealer and was murdered in prison. Ms. Valentine asks if she could store some extra champagne in Alicia's home, and Alicia happily obliges. Alicia gets restless and calls Daniel after some liquid courage supplied by Ms. Valentine. Daniel says yes and tells Alicia to meet him at a local restaurant.<br/><br/>After being an hour late, Daniel tells Alicia to stop with her attitude and chill. He was with his ailing mother and couldn't get to a phone. She understands, and they have a magnificent date. While Alicia slips into something more comfortable, Daniel puts on music. Alicia comes down in a red teddy and suggests a different song. Daniel understands it's emotional because Troy played it on their first date. Alicia stops in her tracks because she never mentioned her ex-boyfriend's name. Daniel knocks Alicia out with an elbow to the face. Alicia wakes up tied to a chair, and Daniel has one question: Where are Troy's diamonds? If Alicia doesn't tell him, he will kill her and anyone who tries to help her.<br/><br/>This movie will have you on pins and needles when Daniel hits Alicia. Everything before that helps set a running clock for Daniel to get the information from Alicia. And you have to watch until the end for the fully satisfying conclusion. The fight scenes, twists, and conclusion were all perfect. And the movie doesn't end with the romantic cinema cliché.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Shy Sky is returning to traditional education after being homeschooled for years. Sky's mom, Nicole, drops Sky off, and Sky runs into an old friend, Marnie. As they walk the campus, Heather, a basketball player, approaches along with her teammates. Sky loves computers and programming. Sky smiles and offers to tutor, but Heather only wants answers. Sky refuses to cheat, and Heather warns Sky not to cross her or other basketball players. For the rest of the day, Sky is alone and anxious. Marnie and Sky come to the practice, and Heather haphazardly says that Sky has computer skills next to their coach, Sandy. Heather thinks Sky would be the best replacement for their score and stat keeper, Sherri. Sandy agrees and makes Sky a member of the basketball team.<br/><br/>Sky enjoys her newfound friendship and all its perks. During a study session, Marnie gives Sky a bag of clothes. Marnie tells Sky that the girls give her clothes to sell on the dark web for Bitcoins. Clueless Sky replaced Sherri's role in a shoplifting ring after Sherri's disappearance. And the girls aren't giving their clothes away. They are stealing them using elaborate yet low-tech ruses. No one knows the puppet master amongst them or how high up it goes.<br/><br/>This movie mixes The Bling Ring and The Pregnancy Pact with mystery sprinkled into it. The script uses the mystery of Sherri's disappearance to keep you watching. The writer cleverly made everyone despicable, causing you to second-guess all of them except Sky and Nicole. Viewers will piece together all the clues you miss when the script reveals the mastermind. The motive is lackluster, but the mystery is compelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mindy's 50th birthday is in 10 days, and she is not handling it well. Mindy chooses to day drink and shop instead. Mindy's car breaks down on the way home. Sam walks by and offers comfort, but Mindy says no. Then she looks up and sees it's her high school sweetheart, Sam. Sam sits and catches up with the divorcée, but they part ways before exchanging numbers.<br/><br/>Mindy's daughter, Rita, is coming to town with Rita's girlfriend, Emily. Rita is 23 and dropped out of school, much to her parent's disappointment. Mindy divorced Mark 2 years ago after he left to find himself. Since then, he started dating someone new that is similar to her.<br/><br/>Emily and Rita arrive to plan Mindy's party, but Mindy tells them she is not in the mood to celebrate her birthday. Then, Emily's uncle enters. And to Mindy's surprise, Emily's uncle is Sam. Rita wants to buy an RV, go to Burning Man, and marry Emily. As Mindy spends more time with Sam, she decides to make drastic changes and have fun with her life. Mindy enjoys her mid-life crisis with Sam until she gets a human reality check: her ex-husband, Mark. Rita invited Mark to attend the surprise engagement. However, he wants Mindy back, Sam gone, and Rita in school.<br/><br/>Let's start by being honest: Rita and Mindy are adults. So telling their parents anything is a courtesy, not asking permission. However, this movie is about Mindy finding herself and seeing her mistakes. She eats what she wants, discovers new things, and finds her first love. Enjoy this entertaining watch with a nice bottle of wine, but expect some lulls throughout the script.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Also, Jamie works with Karina to find her voice. While Karina is accepting, Darren resists. Can Jamie help Darren, or will Ivy's life come crashing down on them?<br/><br/>This movie is Marry Me combined with bad lip-syncing, no wedding, and an average plot. Viewers will not care about any of the characters and lose interest in a foreseeable conclusion. If you watch this movie, you have to watch the beginning. It gives an Entertainment Tonight recap of Ivy's rise to fame, issues with her label, and relationship woes with Becker. This movie is your best option for background noise for two hours.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
