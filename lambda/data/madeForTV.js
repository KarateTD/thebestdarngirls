    "mtitle":"Yoga Teacher Killer: The Kaitlin Armstrong Story",
    "review":"Kaitlin Armstrong manages her boyfriend's career and teaches yoga while handling their rental properties. Kaitlin's boyfriend, cyclist Colin Strickland, gave their relationship another try. After four months together, Kaitlin feels Colin slipping away again. He doesn't want to get married or have children anytime soon, and Kaitlin, who is 35 years old, can feel her biological clock ticking. Then he leaves without saying I love you or Happy Birthday.<br/><br/>After crying to her sister about Colin, Kaitlin confides in her friend. Kaitlin hopes Colin will change his mind after putting more effort into their relationship.<br/><br/>After her race, Colin approaches a fellow cyclist, Moriah Wilson, a.k.a Mo. They share a lot of interest, career changes, and competitive energy. Colin returns to Kaitlin and says he wants to break up. Kaitlin panics and mentions their businesses. Instead of giving up, Kaitlin doubles down on their relationship to prove her worth. After a few months, it works, and Kaitlin has Colin back. Kaitlin is delighted until someone breaks into Mo's home and murders her. Kaitlin falls apart when the police question Colin, but what will she do when they suspect her of the crime?<br/><br/>Kaitlin was an obsessed woman with sunk cost fallacy toward her relationship. And she was preoccupied with her biological clock. She never considered other alternatives like IVF, freezing her eggs, adoption, or finding another man. Her obsession festered into cyberstalking, harassment, and false allegations. Viewers can see that Kaitlin is a backup plan for Colin. The writers ensured that Mo wasn't the antagonist. Mo was the only victim in this story. Kaitlin was a woman with many talents but no identity without Colin. This story is a lesson for those willing to listen.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hotel owner Francesca helps her friend, Malorie, put the finishing touches on her hair and make-up before Malorie's wedding to Jon. After Francesca leaves, Malorie's ex-husband, Ryan, enters and begs for a second chance.<br/><br/>Jon checks out the altar before the wedding and bumps into his future mother-in-law, Pamela. Pamela doesn't hide her disdain for Jon because he didn't fight her resignation. Despite her anger, Pam decided to walk her daughter, Malorie, down the aisle. Pam gives Jon one of his favorite energy drinks to make a temporary truce. Jon heads to his suite and runs into his daughter, Bridget. Jon is happy to see Malorie and Bridget bonding.<br/><br/>Jon straightens his tie in the groom's private suite, and his cousin, business partner Zach, enters with tumblers of scotch. Zach asks Jon to reconsider Zach's girlfriend, Amy, for the promotion. Then, Zach warns Jon that he saw Ryan going to Malorie's room earlier. Jon b-lines for Malorie but crosses paths with Amy first. She wants to discuss the promotion, but Jon doesn't have time. She gives him coffee, and he takes a few sips before going to the bridal suite.<br/><br/>Jon interrupts Ryan's outpouring of emotion and sternly asks him to leave Malorie's suite. As Jon and Malorie kiss, a housekeeper brings a glass of champagne. Jon pours some in a second flute and hands it to Malorie before he takes a sip.<br/><br/>Malorie walks down the aisle with her mother by her side. Then everyone watches in horror while Jon coughs up blood and collapses to the ground. Jon dies at the wedding. Amy returns to Jon's home to grieve while Malorie goes to hers.<br/><br/>Malorie calls Zach and Bridget to meet at her home, but Bridget is too sad to leave Jon's home. Zach arrives, and Malorie gives Zach and Pam somber news. She is two months pregnant with Jon's baby. Then, Detective Levine enters Malorie's home. The autopsy revealed strychnine in Jon's system. So, the police will treat his death as a homicide. Who killed Jon?<br/><br/>Lifetimers have a pen and paper handy because this movie doesn't have a lot of characters but has plenty of motives. Everyone has a grievance and hides a secret from each other. Even Malorie isn't squeaky clean. This script sets itself apart because Malorie isn't the only one looking for clues. The killer's unveiling feels uneventful, but the plot is worth the price of admission. The only thing missing from this wild ride was a murder board.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gemma's phone rings before she leaves her office for a meeting. Rosa passed away in her sleep. Gemma worked in Rosa's restaurant during high school and developed her love for baking. She looks through old photos and finds one image of her high school friend, Max. Gemma's co-worker, Kat, asks about him now. Gemma proudly states that Max is a chef in New York after working in Rosa's restaurant. Days later, Rosa's lawyer, Marvin, calls. Gemma is in Rosa's will.<br/><br/>Max creates another dish at the restaurant but questions his integrity. He doesn't believe that the food is about taste but showmanship. Max asks his friend, Noland, if he can sleep at his place until the reading, and Noland agrees. Noland questions Max about Gemma because she is in town. Max admits he hasn't seen or spoken to Gemma in years.<br/><br/>Max and Gemma meet in Marvin's lobby and catch up before the will reading. Marvin informs them that Rosa left them her restaurant, but their is one caveat. They need to be married in 3 weeks to obtain ownership. However, if neither marries in 3 weeks, Rosa's nephew, Santos, will get ownership. Max grimaces because Santos will tear it down for a condo development. Max believes the stipulation is wild, but Gemma thinks it's possible to find 'the one' and marry in 3 weeks. They are racing to find true love, but the finish line is closer than they think.<br/><br/>This movie is one and a half hours longer than necessary. In real life, Gemma and Max would get married, obtain the business, and get an annulment. The audience will laugh at Gemma and Max's doomed dates, but they are time fillers. You know how the story will conclude, so the movie becomes white noise. Also, if you watch the trailer, you've seen the entire film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ella dries her tears during a product meeting as her new boss, Cole, introduces new products in their food line. He congratulates Ella on her contribution, Croque Monsieur with comté cheese. As Cole speaks, Ella's co-worker, Desi, secretly texts Ella. Desi believes Ella should have gotten the promotion over Cole.  Ella pretends to be happy and meets with her mother, Laury, at a potential home. Laury wants Ella to buy a house and freeze her eggs to prepare for her future self.<br/><br/>At the taste test, Ella beams because she gets to try her latest creation. She tells Desi that comté cheese changed her life when she visited Paris years ago. She takes one bite and spits it out. This blunder is the last straw, and Ella suffers an anxiety spiral. Desi stops Ella by saying she needs a vacation. Ella immediately announces she will take two weeks off and flies to Paris.<br/><br/>Ella arrives in Paris and walks to the La Fromagerie. Ella prattles, but the owner has little to say to the American. He believes her palette doesn't extend beyond cheddar, but she shocks him by ordering comté. She eats her cheese and travels to the dock. She flirts with Gaston but doesn't go any further. Ella arrives at her rental apartment and meets the hostess, owner Clotilde. Ella loves the room and takes it for her trip.<br/><br/>Ella commiserates to Clotilde that she wants to stay, and Clotilde encourages Ella to do it. Ella quits her job and extends her trip for three months. She interns for the cheese owner, Serge, dates Gaston, embraces fashion, finds a new passion, and falls in love.<br/><br/>Based on Fromage à Trois: Paris. Love. Cheese by Victoria Brownlee, this movie is best with wine and an assortment of new cheese. Ella falls for Paris and Gaston simultaneously but worries that she is sinking into a new groove. Serge tells Ella to start a reverse bucket list to enjoy the life she has today. Serge thinks Gaston is a cad, and Gaston believes Serge is a grump. While one man denies the accusation, the other charmingly leans into it. Hallmarkies must watch the screen because translations, alerts, and private communications appear as on-screen notification bubbles. This movie is a treat for the senses and makes the audience crave part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
