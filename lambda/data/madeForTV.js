    "mtitle":"Doomsday Mom: The Lori Vallow Story",
    "review":"Lori Vallow often worries about the biblical teachings of end days. While most brush her off, her husband, Charles, and her brother, Alex, believe as she does.  Lori has a daughter, Tylee, with her ex-husband and a son, J.J., with Charles.  During a yard sale, Lori finds a book written by Chad Daybell.  He discusses the end of days in great detail and prepping for them.  She decides to go to a preppers convention.  Lori doesn't like shooting guns, but she listens to Mel talk about motherhood.  They connect over having sons with autism.  As they talk, Mel tells Lori that she met Chad at a convention, which amazes Lori. The next day, Mel calls and tells Lori that Chad is coming to a local convention.  Both women attend, and Lori approaches him to get her book signed.  He asks to meet with Lori in private after the event, and she agrees.  Later, Chad tells Lori that they were married nine times before and fought for the Lord each time. This meeting will set off a chain of events that starts with a welfare check and ends with dead bodies.<br/><br/>You think you know Lori's story, but you don't.  She is an extreme apocalypticist which causes her to look for signs of evil in the most insignificant actions. But there is a lingering question that comes to mind.  Would Lori go to these depths of depravity if she never met Chad? Or was she always capable of doing this without Chad? This could be a case of Shared Psychotic Disorder.  Regardless of the answer, several people, including two innocent children, suffered the ultimate price.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"To Catch a Spy",
    "review":"Travel writer Chloe won't let traveling with her ex-boyfriend and boss, Tom, dampen her trip.  She has her friend and photographer, Sara, by her side, and she plans on meeting her college friend, Elias, at his new hotel in Malta. In the hallway, Chloe sees a man fussing with his electronic key, and she helps him.  He smiles and introduces himself as Aaron.  Chloe tries to get some sleep, but there is a loud commotion in the room above her.  Soon, she hears a crash and runs to the balcony.  Chloe sees a man dead on the ground and runs for help.  She knocks on Aaron's door.  Aaron reveals he is FBI and tells her to go back to her room.  After talking to the hotel manager, Bree, Chloe discovers that the disturbance came from Elias's room, but, according to Bree, he checked out an hour ago.  When Aaron looks for the body, he can't find it. Now, Chloe has nothing to back up her claim, and the police speculate that she made it up.  Chloe will use her love of crime novels to solve this mystery.<br/><br/>The villain will leave you wanting more, but revealing the villain isn't the most compelling moment. The villain's swagger, laughter, and hypnotic disposition will make you want a series following their wrongdoing. This movie focuses on Chloe using her love of crime novels and talented friends to find a body and a killer. But she had no idea the reality involved espionage, secret documents, and diplomats.  While this won't be your favorite movie series on H.M.M., it has the potential to be more.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cradle Did Fall",
    "review":"Before going to Stockholm for business, Dean checks to see if his wife, Taylor, is ok.  After having their daughter, Mia, Taylor suffered from Postpartum Depression.  Taylor tells Dean she will be ok and promises to ask for help if she needs it.  Taylor takes Mia for a walk but feels like someone is watching her.  She tells her friend, Lindsey, but Lindsey tells Taylor to relax. On the next trip to the park, Taylor walks into Katherine's picture. The women spark a conversation, and Katherine admits she wanted to try infant photography. Katherine offers to take pictures of Mia for free to create a portfolio, but Taylor says no.  Later that night, Taylor hears a loud noise coming from Mia's room.  When Taylor investigates, she sees that someone disturbed Mia's window, so Taylor calls the police.  The police find no evidence of a break in, so they write Taylor off.  A few days later, Taylor sees Katherine at the park again and takes her offer for free photos. Katherine comes to Taylor's house with her assistant and daughter, Skylar. That night, Taylor wakes up to a parent's worst nightmare: Mia is gone. Now, this momma bear has to take on the police, past employers, and self-doubt to get Mia back.<br/><br/>Based on true events, this movie is the weakest of the series.  It adds too much to the story, and in turn, becomes a stereotypical Lifetime movie.  When you read the story, only the kidnapper's profession is the same. You can skip this entry in the series.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
