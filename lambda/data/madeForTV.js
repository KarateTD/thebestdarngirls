This movie just doesn't capture your attention and the story line is over done.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

Rachel will do anything to get Anna's baby as a replacement for the baby she lost.  This movie is predictable from beginning to end.  Even the twist is boring.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars.",

Bad cinematography choices, boring storyline, and flat joke, makes this a movie you can skip.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",
