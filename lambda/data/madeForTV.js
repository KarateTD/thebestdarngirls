    "review":"Heaven left her small-town life behind for her mother's family.  She is taken back by their wealth and feels instantly out of place.  Her grandmother, Jillian only wanted her around for a few days, her step-grandfather, Tony, offers to make the stay permanent.  She just has to give up her father's side of the family and give in to his needs.  Heaven agrees and becomes a lady of wealth.  But when she gets engaged, lies told by everyone are exposed and leave a path of pain, destruction, and death.<br/><br/>Book lovers beware, this movie hasn't fixed the mistakes of the first movie.  Movie lovers, get ready for some of the biggest shocks in Lifetime's history.  One remarkable aspect is the costume and set design work.  As Heaven transforms, her clothes do too but they stay within the margins of the period.  This attention to detail is paid to the sets as well.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After Hades attempts to escape on V.K. Day, Mal decides to close the barrier around Auradon for good.  This change in ideals hurts King Ben so she decides to keep it secret.  When a thief takes the crown and Malificent's scepter, Mal is hit with a dose of magic that can only be reversed by Hades's amulet.  The V.K.'s go back to the Isle to retrieve the scepter and learn the thief has cast a spell on Auradon.  Now, Mal has to depend on the villains she knows to stop a villain she has never encountered.  What will happen to Mal's friendships when her decision to close the barrier is exposed?<br/><br/>A bittersweet movie for Disney's Descendants franchise will bring joy, and a little sorrow, to every fans' heart.  With the untimely passing of Cameron Boyce, this movie should be deemed as a celebration of his life, talent, and passion.  With memorable songs, costumes, and choreography, this movie still maintained a strong plot.  It differed from the first two films because it didn't rely on the bad guys you know.  It creates new characters and delivered a powerful message to kids and adults alike.  See this movie with the whole family.  Also, donate to The Cameron Boyce Foundation.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

With 15 million reasons, can Jake convince Brooke to go with his plan.<br/><br/>So, who is running the game and who are the players?  Record this movie because you will need to watch it twice to keep up.  With so many people having a play, it's hard to see who is in control.  There are a few unanswered questions with this movie but the original plot makes up for the holes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Tiffany knows Shawn wouldn't want that.  And Amber's lack of respect for Shawn leads Tiffany to believe that Amber his behind his murder.  She has 3 days to find evidence or Shawn will be cremated and Amber will go free.<br/><br/>The last movie in the Love, Lies, and Murder promo fall flat of the others.  This movie feels more like a Lifetime movie than TV One.  Since the ending is predictable, the journey must be worthwhile.  This one missed the mark.  The best moment is the revealed secret at the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Katherine convinces her sister Amelia to try out for the lead in an Italian movie.  She is flabbergasted when she gets the part.  However, she doesn't know how to handle all the new demands.  To get ahead of the media, her director Dominic hires a local paper to write about her.  The writer happens to be Philip.  Philip was her bellhop and pretended to not speak English when they met.  As he interviews her, they get close.  But when he breaks a promise, will this budding romance survive his writing?<br/><br/>Inspired by a book, this movie just doesn't capture your full attention.  The side characters are more interesting with the lengths they go through to keep them together.  This is a movie to watch if you want to kill 2 hours.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
