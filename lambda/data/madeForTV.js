    "mtitle": "Surviving My Father: The Rachel Jeffs Story",
    "review": "Rachel Jeffs sits with her husband, Richard, for the first time. He's ready to explain how a man and a wife make a baby, but she already knows. This knowledge perplexes Richard because the church bans women from knowing until their wedding day. She knows because she suffered sexual abuse at the hands of her father, Warren Jeffs, for eight years. Richard runs to Warren, and he begs Richard for forgiveness. The two men promise never to speak of this again and shake hands. Rachel believes she has found the lord's grace and can live peacefully. Her devotion to the prophet will sink her deeper into the hands of the devil. Can Rachel escape?<br/><br/>Based on the memoir Breaking Free: How I Escaped Polygamy, the FLDS Cult, and My Father Warren Jeffs by Rachel Jeffs, this film makes you want to throw your remote at the television. The costume department carefully studied the women's clothing. The vanity department gave the actress a signature plain look with big hair. You will wonder why Rachel doesn't walk away. Viewers must remember the control these men enforced on the women. They stole their children, individuality, and faith. The actresses will rip your soul apart as they cry and beg for their kids. However, your blood will boil as they blame their sins for the abuse they suffer. This film will evoke every emotion. This movie is a must-watch, but only with a compassionate heart.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "While They Were Sleeping",
    "review": "Detectives Rachel and Adam arrive at the home of William and Zoe. Zoe called 911. She woke up and found William dead with a gunshot wound to his head. Rachel interviews Zoe and discovers that Zoe is William's second wife, and they got custody of William's daughter, Jess, from his first marriage to Robin. Rachel and Adam examine the crime scene. They deduce that the culprit was familiar with the layout and entry points. She questions Zoe about William's enemies and competitors, but Zoe says William had none.<br/><br/>Rachel enters Robin's home. Robin tells Rachel she lost her daughter because of her drug addiction after a car accident. On the night of William's murder, Robin was at a bar with her new boyfriend, Dean. They stayed until the last round. Then, Rachel unearths a life insurance policy with Zoe as the beneficiary. Zoe swears she didn't know about the policy, but her signature is on it. Zoe explains that William signed her name to documents. Rachel doesn't believe her. She thinks Zoe killed her husband for the insurance. But can she prove it without solid evidence?<br/><br/>This movie starts with an intriguing mystery that's Dateline-worthy. A woman wakes up next to her dead husband after sleeping through the gunshot. She has no residue on her hands, but the killer knew the home. The writers took a step back and allowed the audience to uncover the culprit with Zoe. While the characters turn on her, the audience knows she's the easy suspect. You will create several suspects and motives. Let's say that yours is better than the conclusion. It's a letdown for a steady climax. Hopefully, this 2025 Shocktober kickoff isn't a sign of the season to come.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Adventures in Love and Birding",
    "review": "Celeste escapes her nosy co-workers with her best friend Eva. Eva wants Celeste to step out into the world and be more adventurous. Since her divorce, Celeste hasn't thought about love. Eva receives a call that an opportunity has opened up, but she promised her friend, John, that she would help him with his birding competition. Then, she gets a bright idea. Celeste will join him and get out in the world. John attended these competitions with his ex-girlfriend, Breena, and they won for three years. Breena cheated on him with her now partner, Lazlo. As Celeste asks questions, Eva takes another phone call. Celeste inquires if this is a fake girlfriend setup. Eva replies Yes, but to the person on the phone. Celeste agrees.<br/><br/>Celeste arrives at the competition first and meets President Linda. She tells Linda that she's John's partner, and Breena overhears. John greets everyone, and Celeste embraces him with an overly dramatic hug. She tells everyone she's John's new girlfriend and partner. John hides his confusion until they are alone. He explains that Eva was only going to be his partner, not a pretend girlfriend. However, they decide to keep up the lie. John informs Celeste that he must win this competition to beat his ex-girlfriend and start a bird-watching business. Celeste will use her time to be adventurous in birding. But will she gain a passion for love?<br/><br/>This film has what you would expect from a Hallmark film. You have a competition, two people working together, and a unique hobby. The love story is predictable, but the setup isn't. There is a bonus storyline about Celeste and her college-bound daughter, Morgan. This subplot will stun Hallmarkies more than the main one. The actors did their best to present compelling characters, but your interest will wane after the 2nd act.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "I Was a Child Bride: The Courtney Stodden Story",
    "review": "Courtney Stodden cries to her mother, Krista, because she's the victim of bullying. Krista decides to pull Courtney out of traditional school. She can homeschool Courtney and give Courtney the chance to pursue their dream of being famous. Krista seeks a talent manager for guidance. Krista's friend, Tim, recommends Doug Hutchison. Doug has a program called The Art of Stillness. Krista jumps at the opportunity to have Doug coach Courtney. Krista's need for fame and fortune will send Courtney into a tailspin of grooming, abuse, assault, and drugs while being fodder for tabloids and public ridicule.<br/><br/>This film shows that Courtney was a lamb to the slaughter. Krista and Courtney's father, Alex, made it easy for Doug to clean the bones. Her religion lulled her into compliance. Courtney's film explains the abandonment and devastation she faced at home and in public. She was shamed online and abused in her relationship. This movie is a cautionary tale of grooming, vicarious parents, and the dark side of fame. While Courtney forgives her parents, Lifetimers won't. Hopefully, this script will spark a conversation about child brides and their portrayal in the industry.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadly Desire",
    "review": "Nurse Brittney prepares to have dinner with her boyfriend, James, James's friend, Ben, and Ben's new friend, photographer Tanya. After dinner, Tanya enters the bathroom with Brittney, making her feel uncomfortable. Brittney doesn't plan on seeing Tanya again, but James invited them for game night.<br/><br/>During game night, Ben is rude to Tanya, and it rubs Brittney the wrong way. Tanya calls Brittney to spend girl time together and release the tension between them. Brittney gives Tanya a second chance and visits Tanya's home. Tanya convinces Brittney to let her take a few photos. Brittney thinks this will be harmless fun between them. However, Tanya will use these images to dismantle Brittney's life, all for revenge. Will Brittney survive with her life intact?<br/><br/>This film is a weird and convoluted waste of time. The plot is all over the place with zero substance. The actors did the best they could with an unbearable script. And sadly, the conclusion hints at a part two. The writers shouldn't waste Lifetimer's time. Skip this film at all costs.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
