    "review": "Ava and her boyfriend, former football player Ellis, take a private jet to Ireland for the International Gastro Gala. Ava needs help opening a new restaurant. Her current contract prohibits her from starting an establishment within 5 years of quitting. She needs a restaurateur to invest in her to create her dream job. After they land, Ava and Ellis join a party. Ava asks the gala chairperson, Karen, to let her join the competition. Karen says no. Karen's scathing words when Lily, a social media brand manager, introduces herself. She gushes over Ava's talents and historic rise to fame. They exit the bathroom and run into restaurateur Chef Rene. However, Rene doesn't believe Ava can live up to her Michelin Star. He does ask Ava to train the competitors for the sous chef competition. She agrees. Ava returns to the party, and Ellis calls her over to meet a new acquaintance. Ava stops in her tracks when she sees her ex-boyfriend, Luke. Before Luke can react, his girlfriend Lily calls his name. Ava relaxes and focuses on her date. However, they can feel the attraction between them.<br/><br/>Later, Ava goes to the market while Ellis plays golf. She runs into Luke while shopping for ingredients. They chat about his time in Paris and his new relationship. They hug goodbye while ignoring their feelings. Ava takes her ingredients to the competition and meets the contestants. She stumbles on her words when she sees Luke. She can't ignore the attraction between them anymore. Who will they choose?<br/><br/>This sequel solidifies the meaning of love. Both Ava and Luke are torn between two lovers. The writer created a romantic rectangle. Viewers know that Luke is the love of Ava's life, but Ellis is a good man with great potential. Lily is the bright, only child with rich parents. Lifetimers shouldn't judge the young, hopeful woman too harshly. Ellis and Lily aren't oblivious to the trouble looming in their relationship. The plot pushes them confront their relationship head-on and create funny but uncomfortable situations. While this story can stand on its own, it's up to the viewer to determine if it's better than the first. Either way, it's beguiling.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jenna and Grant unpack and settle into their new home. Grant reminds Jenna that his boss, Matt, wants to be the first dinner guest. Matt brings his wife Rainy, who can't believe how much Jenna looks like Grant's deceased first wife. Jenna never knew Grant was married. Matt reveals that Grant is a magnificent pianist, which is more information Jenna didn't know. During the dinner, Matt and Jenna have a heated argument about ethics in the legal profession. Jenna apologizes to Grant, and he forgives her. Rainy drunkenly stumbles into the car, noting how she looks exactly like Grant's ex-wife. Jenny can't hide her rage after Matt and Rainy leave. Grant hid a significant part of his life from her, and she can't sleep next to a stranger. She tells him to sleep on the couch.<br/><br/>Jenna wakes to find that Grant isn't there. He left early for work and didn't want to bother her because she had been upset previously. Jenna's curiosity gets the better of her, and she looks up Grant's first wife online. Then, someone calls and threatens her to stop digging. After a business meeting, Jenna receives a knock on her door. It's a piano delivery. Jenna is clueless about the package, and Grant tells her to reject it. Later, Detective Diane rings Jenna's doorbell. Diane questions Jenna about their dinner date with Matt and Rainy. Jenna tells Diane about Grant's secrets, the argument, and the threatening phone call. It piques Diane's interest because someone murdered Rainy, and Grant is now their number one suspect. Jenna's world is upside down, and she has no one to trust. Can she find the truth before the killer comes after her?<br/><br/>This film goes from wild to outlandish to crazy over the course of two hours. It combines 3 cliché Lifetime plots into one movie. However, it remains entertaining. Also, Jenna's father is one of the best written comic reliefs on Lifetime. He has platinum dad jokes, great one-liners, and a comedic edge. The killer has the strangest motive. However, the storyline has been so eccentric that you just accept it. Viewers should watch this film when they need a good laugh with a zany plot.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Shenae offers her daughter, Brooke, breakfast, but has forgotten that Brooke is now vegan. After Brooke leaves, Shenae gets a call from Laura, her husband's attorney. She flashes back to her husband's trial. Four years ago, her husband, Leo, was on trial for killing Robin and Brooke's best friend, Danika. Shenae testified against him. The jury sentenced Leo to death. Shenae ignores Laura's phone call.<br/><br/>Later, Shenae gets a call from Brooke's school. Brooke didn't attend her classes and is failing. When Brooke returns home, Shenae confronts her. Brooke admits to spending time with Danika's father, Alexander, at his diner. Shenae supports Brooke's fatherly relationship with Alexander, but it doesn't excuse missing school. Brooke wants to focus on saving Leo from the death penalty.<br/><br/>Brooke goes to the prison to talk to Leo. She doesn't believe he's guilty, and she's working with Laura to prove it. When Brooke doesn't come home, Shenae begins to worry and contacts Laura. Laura directs Shenae to the storage unit. Inside, Shenae's worst fears come to life. She finds signs of a struggle and blood. She must locate Brooke before the culprit ends Brooke's life. That can only happen when she does something she never wanted to do: re-open Leo's case.<br/><br/>This film starts as a whodunit, but there is only one viable suspect. So, the mystery falls flat. Viewers should respect Shenae's struggle for justice and respect. The writers ensured she didn't accept the police's lax attitude about her missing daughter. The editing team should steer away from text messages on screen. They were often hard to read and poorly lit. This plot has such a strong lead that it sacrifices the mystery. Mystery fans may not find this film intriguing, but fighting moms will.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Annie's best friend, Joanna, gave Annie her spot on a wellness retreat. Joanna also provided Annie with her clothes and luggage. As Annie enters the hotel, she stumbles in Joanna's heels, and Jake catches her. They make flirty eye contact and have a polite exchange. The concierge gives Annie a personal tour of the facilities before directing Annie to her room. He informs Annie that the owner, Robert, will make a guest appearance at tonight's welcome dinner. When he sees Lara make a mistake, he informs Annie that Lara's new to the hotel.<br/><br/>Annie arrives at the welcome dinner and sits with influencer Kimberly. Kimberly notices Annie looking at the handsome man at the table across from them. Annie briefs Kimberly about their meet-cute. Kimberly tells Annie that his name is Jake and he is a venture capitalist from Chicago. Then, Kimberly goes around the room and gives Annie information on the most exclusive guest. Annie's neighbors are Carolyn and Peter. Peter is a workaholic, and Carolyn focuses on philanthropic pursuits. Colin made his fortune in professional gambling, while Rebecca is a duchess with refined taste. Then, Robert enters and warmly greets everyone.<br/><br/>Annie walks around the facilities and sees Jake using the wrong lens to take photos of birds. When she looks back, she sees him change the lens and take photos of Carolyn and Peter. She knows something is off with Jake. He confirms her feelings when she catches him sneaking around in her room. Jake tells her the truth. He is a private investigator. Someone stole the Crestfall Diamonds from the museum. And his source told him the buyer would be at the hotel. He decides to use Annie's charms to his advantage. Guests believe they are a couple in the making. So they will play along to gather information. Annie's jovial about joining Jake's team and becoming his Girl Friday. As they search for the buyer, will she become more?<br/><br/>This film doesn't have the intricate plot of a Hallmark Mystery movie, but it is funny and enjoyable. While this is a Winter Escape film, the movie doesn't focus on the landscape or the culture. The script puts the couple and the mystery at the forefront of the storyline. The writers created a new male detective in Jake. He doesn't try to push Annie away when she wants to join his investigation. He encourages her and learn some of her techniques. This movie sums up one season of a Hallmark Mystery series. This could become an annual Winter Escape movie with the proper direction.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Evelyn, Jennifer, and Vanessa become friends while competing on the reality show, The Gentleman Suitor. Vanessa makes the final two against Alex for Jasper's affection. Jasper picks Alex, breaking Vanessa's heart. Afterward, the women sit and discuss their future. Widow Evelyn worries about her son, Will, attending college, while Jennifer fears how this exposure and loss will affect her business. They promise to support each other and remain friends.<br/><br/>Months later, Evelyn and Vanessa meet Jennifer. She has an idea. Jennifer wants to leave Los Angeles for the south. While they support her, they refuse to leave. However, they changed their mind later. Vanessa's business is floundering, and Will's overprotective behavior is getting on Evelyn's nerves. They call Jennifer, and she bounces with excitement. These women will find love, freedom, and strength in their friendship, jobs, and relationships.<br/><br/>Inspired by the hit song Breathe Again, these three women run from a problem that resurfaces. It is the overarching theme of the movie. They lean on each other to overcome their overwhelming issues. This film is one of the healthiest displays of female friendship. The script offers heartfelt and intelligent conversations while having a good time. The dialogue is gentle and understanding. While the film is a deviation from Lifetime's shock and awe, it is missing a hook to reel you into the plot.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
