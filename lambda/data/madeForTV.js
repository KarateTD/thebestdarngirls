    "review":"Tara works at a local station as a meteorologist. She is the most accurate but only number two in the ratings. Sam, at another station, is number one. Tara's assistant, Mia, found a viral video of a national meteorologist flipping out and quitting on air. Tara thinks it's her time to shine and calls for an interview. Don answers and says she is the first to call for the position. He tells her he is familiar with her work and will call back when he has time for an interview. Tara hangs up and sees Sam behind her, making a phone call to Don. From what Tara can hear, Don likes Sam too.<br/><br/>At 2:40 am, Don calls Tara. Don wants to see her that evening for an interview. Tara says yes but knows there is a snowstorm coming to the town. She believes Don is testing her abilities. So she goes to work early to figure out the logistics. It's too late to book a flight or a train, so Tara must drive.<br/><br/>Tara leaves, but the GPS keeps rerouting her because of road closures. She drives toward a police-enforced detour and begs to go forward. The officer won't let her through, but he informs her an inn is within miles. She drives to the Mistletoe Inn, and Sam is behind her. Olivia, the innkeeper, says they are closed for the off-season. Olivia says she has one bedroom with a couch available. Tara offers the couch to Sam.<br/><br/>Sam and Tara call Don to update him. In a static-filled call, Don tells them to record a short news segment and send it to him, and he will decide based on their segment sample. Sam wanders into the basement and finds a trove of Christmas decorations. After the Christmas festival flopped a few years ago, the mayor decided not to have it. And they never had it again. Tara wants to cover the Christmas Festival for her segment. Sam wants to bring Christmas back to the town and report on the party. Who will win?<br/><br/>In any other movie, Tara would be the out-of-touch, evil boss, and Mia would be the main character. Tara's jealousy is center stage. She believes opportunities fall into Sam's lap without him trying. However, he has a relaxed approach that invites others to give him information and assistance. While Tara and Sam have chemistry and the townspeople are charming, this movie blends in with all the others this season, like Cloudy with a Chance of Christmas.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara wants to pitch her dating app to tech genius Elliot Everest face-to-face. Tonight, she plans to crash Elliot's holiday staff party. She hacks the guest list and has several color bands in her purse. Tara's aunt Rhonda applauds her tenacity but tells Tara to be careful.<br/><br/>Tara walks to the party confidently and runs into Tre with coffee. It spills on his suit and her. The tux is his design and can withstand spills. Tara can tell Tre is also a party crasher and decides to help him get into the party through the kitchen. Tre wants to show his designs to Elliot's daughter, London. London is a social media influencer who can make his brand global overnight. Tara sees London arguing over FaceTime with her boyfriend, Canyon, and overhears Canyon breaking up with London. London ignores Tara but makes a B-line for Tre because she can use him to make Canyon jealous. Tre and Tara pretend they are cousins to get into the party.<br/><br/>Tara tries to pitch her app, but it won't open. Elliot walks away, telling Tara to make an appointment. Then Tara sees a decoration spark and fall. She pushes Elliot out of the way and saves him. Elliot is grateful, but his wife, Sapphire, sees Tara's a crasher and wants to kick Tara and Tre out. Elliot wants Tara to stay, and London pleads for Tre.<br/><br/>Sapphire gets a call from her Christmas Brunch planner. He can't plan her party, and no designers can work with this short notice over the holidays. Sapphire pulls Tara aside to talk, and Tara says her last name is Aries. Sapphire asks if Tara is related to party planning expert Calvin Aries, and Tara lies. Tara says she is Calvin's niece. So, Sapphire hires Tara as her party planner, and London hires Tre to make her dress after feeling his suit. Tara has to plan a party, keep up a lie, and find time to cleverly present her app with Elliott while falling in love with Tre as he falls for London. Sure, she has it under control.<br/><br/>This movie amps up the crazy quickly. Tara uses high-tech and quick wit to sneak into homes. But her gift of gab doesn't translate into her pitches. Tre operates as her sounding board and advisor and believes in her and her app from the moment they meet. And the writers helped viewers see the love the Everest family has for each other. They put the fun in dysfunctional. Tara's lies are the antagonist in this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mercedes is a married mother of two and works as a marriage counselor. Her husband, Matthew, reminds Mercedes that their daughter, Ashley, has a recital at 1 pm. Mercedes promises to make it but doesn't come because she meets with her financial advisor instead. Mercedes comes home in time for dinner with their friends, Faith and Caleb, but only talks about herself, her clients, and her business. Caleb interjects and tells Matthew to announce his good news. He will head the biggest project in the company's history. Mercedes is proud of Matthew but states he should be a partner.<br/><br/>Later, Matthew decides to leave Mercedes because she puts work in front of everyone and everything. Mercedes goes to a bar to drink her troubles away and talks to a man, David, sitting next to her. She wishes he could see what her life would be like without her. David grants her wish. Matthew will get a life without her, but Mercedes will get one without him. Can she handle the truth?<br/><br/>Mercedes values success and the appearance of success more than anything else, and family comes second. Mercedes has wealth, a mansion, and a successful practice in her new life, but she doesn't have Matthew, her children, or her friends. The writers did a great job of recapping Mercedes's life before her husband. She used an old video camera, news clippings, and photos to review her childhood and rise to the top. Mercedes uncovers an unlikely friend in a burlesque dancer named Candy. Candy shows Mercedes true and unwavering friendship and kindness. This film warns viewers to be careful what they wish for, because they might get it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Noël is the youngest daughter of Garvin and Sheryl. When Noël was younger, Garvin and Sheryl put their life savings into a production company. Now, Garvin is an entertainment mogul with Noël by his side, destined to take over one day. Noël older sister, Naomi, focuses on being the life of the party. She married Marcus, and they have one child, Ryan. Naomi and Noël fight like cats and dogs.<br/><br/>On Christmas, Noël hears Garvin yelling on the phone and checks on him. Garvin tells Noël not to worry and happy birthday. The family dances after dinner and talks about the New Year's Eve party. Then, Garvin collapses and dies of a heart attack. Sheryl, Noël, and Naomi meet with Garvin's lawyer, Miles, after the funeral. To Noël and Naomi's surprise, Garvin left the production company to both of them equally. Miles says they are broke, and the company will have to shut its doors if they don't make changes.<br/><br/>Eleven months later, Noël feels the pressure, and her current movies flopped. She is working on a streaming deal with Samantha with little help from Naomi. When Ryan looks up to Noël, Naomi wants to prove her worth, but in her way. Noël and Naomi want to save the company but constantly bicker. Miles meets Sheryl and warns her that she will have to sell her home if the company doesn't prosper. Noël must succeed but will it be at the expense of her family?<br/><br/>This family goes through it! Their dad dies, they're broke, and they could lose their company. Bad news comes in threes for them. Although the family does argue with low blows, the writer made sure you understand everyone's perspective. The family doesn't have a bad guy. There is an antagonist, but they are outside the family circle. This movie is better on BET+ because the commercials break up the storyline too much and for too long.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Justine Valentine has the number one song in the country, the number one trending topic, and dominates all forms of social media with her latest single 'Never Cared About Christmas.' Sway asks Justine about her family during the holiday and their feelings about the song. Justine tells Sway her family's fine with it, but they call to voice their displeasure. Justine wants to make it up to them and show them how much the holidays mean to her. So she decided to have Christmas dinner, Feast of the 7 Fishes, at her home with a reality TV camera crew. Justine invites her family, friends, and boyfriend, Conceited. Justine's cousin, Izzy, comes to the house and pushes Justine to start preparing soon. She has three days to shop, decorate, and cook. But no matter how prepared she is, this family brings loud and fun drama with a holiday lesson.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit hard to describe. It mixes an SNL skit with My Big Fat Greek Wedding (Italian style) and a splash of Wild-N-Out. It has plenty of guest stars from film, TV, and reality TV but skips the fall-in-love romance angle. If you don't take the movie seriously, like Dumb and Dumber, the movie is a good laugh. Otherwise, this film will annoy you.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
