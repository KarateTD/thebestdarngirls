    "review": "At work, Sonja meets her client, Robert, and submits updated architectural plans. He approves the designs and asks Sonja to meet him in his hotel room that night. Sonja declines because she wants to work on her marriage. She wants to give her husband, Jason, another chance. Sonja and Jason leave the city to stay at a cabin. It's close enough for Sonja to drive to work for emergencies. Jackie calls Sonja out of the blue to discuss the designs. Sonja tells Jackie that Robert approved them, but Jackie never got the message. Sonja updates Jason and promises to return to the cabin after an overnight business trip.<br/><br/>Mia reads love notes from her husband, Robert, around the house. Robert tells Mia she has to stay late before she leaves. The next day, an officer knocks on Mia's door with grim news. Robert died in a hotel alone, and they suspect that he died from autoerotic asphyxiation. The police return Robert's artifacts, and Mia goes through them. She smells a scarf and taps his phone. However, the phone is dead. She charges it and leaves it behind to go to Robert's workplace.<br/><br/>Sonja stands at the front desk waiting to meet Jackie while Mia asks for parking validation. Mia recognizes a familiar scent coming from Sonja as Sonja walks towards Jackie's office. Sonja meets with Jackie and hears that Robert died and his wife will take over momentarily. Sonja never knew Roger had a wife. Mia returns home and opens Robert's cell. She sees a string of explicit text from Sonja dating back months. She screams in the shower and makes a plan. Days later, Mia knocks on Jason's cabin, pretending to be their neighbor, Claire. Mia will slowly worm into Jason's life to seek revenge. Can Sonja catch Mia in time, or will Sonja pay the ultimate price for Mia's vendetta?<br/><br/>This film opens with two stories that don't gel for 20 minutes. It can be hard to follow if you don't pay attention at the beginning. Sonja and Jason's marital problems make it easy for Mia to infiltrate their relationship. The movie shows you Mia's fantasies too. This imagery can be distracting, but it expresses Mia's resolve. This film's conclusion allows the writer to give the viewer a part two, but it will need a more compelling story for viewers to watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Killer with No Name",
    "review": "Podcaster Fiona returns home for her parents' anniversary party. They invited the town, including retired Sheriff Raphael. At the party, Marcus Holt, owner of Holt's Vineyard, praises Barry and Cecily on their commitment to the community and raising a famous podcaster. Fiona's friend, Daisy, greets Fiona warmly and alerts Fiona about Dr. Joseph, Fiona's high school ex-boyfriend. Then, Marcus's wife, Emily, approaches and gushes about Fiona's podcast. Fiona blushes at the compliments, but Rafael distracts her. She follows him and finds him sitting on a back porch.<br/><br/>Rafael tells Fiona about a poker game he had with friends recently. They talked about old unsolved cases, and Rafael mentioned the girl with no name. A woman, Vicky, walked her dog around the trailer park. The pup picked up a scent, followed it, and dug up a baby's corpse. No one claimed the baby. So, the town buried the infant. One of Rafael's poker buddies saw someone put flowers on the grave every year. Fiona deduces that the person must know the child. Rafael gives Fiona the case files because he wants a fresh perspective. He invites Fiona to his cabin in the morning to discuss the files.<br/><br/>Fiona arrives at Rafael's home and discovers the front door open. She gingerly enters and sees Rafael dead. She calls the police for help. Sheriff Walker assumes Rafael succumbed to his heart issues, but Fiona thinks Walker is wrong. She asks Joseph to report the coroner's findings and look into the 'girl with no name' case. Fiona has unearthed a dangerous can of worms that will rock the town and threaten her life.<br/><br/>This movie's title is misleading because Lifetime changed it. It's the deceased infant that doesn't have a name. Then, the plot changes after the first commercial break. Fiona switches from solving a cold case to looking for Rafael's killer. The script builds Fiona as an astute crime solver, but she trusts the wrong people, lets down her guard, and talks too much. If you stay, the plot will treat the viewer to corruption, greed, and the ultimate betrayal. This movie is entertaining if you are patient and accept the twist.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Family Nightmare: Secrets of Maple Street",
    "review": "Archer asks his girlfriend, Brittany, to go for a walk. He states that Brittany is drunk and wants to take her home. She tells Archer her parents, Betsy and Dr. Pete, aren't home when they arrive, but Archer refuses to enter. Brittany cautiously stalks through her home but doesn't feel alone. Then, she wakes up in her parents' bed with a bump on her head and a splitting headache.<br/><br/>Pete examines his daughter and explains she had a nasty fall. He found her at the bottom of the staircase, reeking of alcohol. They called the police because they didn't know what happened. However, nothing was missing or disrupted. Brittany believes someone broke in and hit her on the head.<br/><br/>Brittany stops Archer before school because she wants him to skip practice and go to the police station with her. She believes her parents are holding something back. Brittany asks Detective Vaughn to pull up the police report of her parents' call. However, Detective Vaughn didn't find it because they never reported Brittany's accident. Brittany decides to raid her father's weed stash in his garage. While looking for drugs, Brittany finds a wallet belonging to Tony Dale. She has no idea who he is or why Pete has it.<br/><br/>Detective Vaughn visits Pete and Betsy's home a few days later. Their neighbor found a dead body while fishing. Detective Vaughn inquires about the dead body, Tony Dale. Both Betsy and Pete say they don't know him. Brittany knows her parents are lying and don't know why. She demands the truth at dinner. Pete relents and confesses. He found Tony in their home with Brittany on the floor. Pete flew into a rage, killed Tony, and threw Tony's body into the lake. Betsy and Pete will keep quiet about Tony's murder and expect Brittany to do the same. But something plagues Brittany about Pete's confession. They are at the beginning of a family nightmare.<br/><br/>The second installment of the Secret of Maple Street series opens with shiny mornings and deceitful nights. Pete is a respected doctor, while Betsy is the neighborhood gossip. Their daughter, Brittany, is a bright troublemaker who won't back down from the truth. This plot and score will give you Desperate Housewives vibes because it's saucy and comical. However, the conclusion may not sit well with viewers. There is one victim in the movie, and their fate is horrible. This movie is entrancing if you give it time. But the ending will make you upset.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Very Vermont Christmas",
    "review": "Joy skis the slopes with her mother, Mary, but leaves early to brew beer at Mogul Joe's Brew Pub. Her dad, Joe, started the brewery with very little. But business is slow now. Then, Joy's ex-boyfriend, Frosty's owner Greg, enters her pub. Greg wanted Joy to sell her company to Schultz Distribution, like he did, to save her pub, but she turned them down. Schultz is having an inaugural Vermont Christmas Brew-Ski competition. The winner will get a distribution deal. Joy promises to consider it.<br/><br/>Joy stands near the ski lift, texting, when a man, Zac, bumps into her. She guides Zac to the milder runs for the other skiers' safety. Later, Joy sees Zac at the café and gets to know him. Zac is a Schultz salesman, and they want him to open a craft beer division. Joy rages about big companies ruining smaller businesses and excuses herself. Zac walks into Mogul Joe's that afternoon and sympathizes with Joy's plight. She challenges him to a beer tasting. He aces it because he's studying to be a cicerone. He impresses Joy.<br/><br/>Joy sees Zac at the café again. She approaches him and asks for help. Joy is creating a holiday brew for the competition but can't get the flavors to balance. He will help her if Joy teaches him to ski. They agree and work together. Greg sees the time Joy spends with Zac, and Greg's jealousy grows. He wants to stop their relationship and has the selfie to end their romance. Will Greg succeed?<br/><br/>Zac is the most mature character ever written in a holiday movie. He is honest, fun, and admits his faults. It's easy for experienced Hallmarkies to assume the new guy will keep the secret corporate plan until the film's conclusion. You will ponder what the point of the movie is until Greg's bitterness takes center stage. It will all come together but lose your interest. Viewers should allow this film to play in the background while doing something else.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Ellen jogs on the Errington College track when her student, Shannon, challenges her to a race. Shannon easily defeats her advisor. They laugh, and Shannon asks to use Ellen's computer to write a paper. Ellen says yes without hesitation.<br/><br/>Shannon comes to Ellen's office, and they talk. Shannon admits she feels out of place because the other students have money. Ellen doesn't pry because Shannon is a straight-A student. Ellen asks Shannon to meet her after Thanksgiving for lunch. Shannon accepts with a smile.<br/><br/>After Thanksgiving break, Shannon doesn't come to Ellen's office for lunch. Then, Shannon's teacher calls Ellen. Shannon missed the midterm, didn't turn in homework, and didn't attend class. Ellen knows something is wrong and goes to the dean. The dean assumes Shannon dropped out and doesn't offer help. Ellen's worried someone kidnapped Shannon. And Ellen's correct.<br/><br/>For weeks, King seduced and learned about Shannon. She revealed that she has no friends or family and doesn't live in the dorm. He drugged her drink during dinner and chained her inside a trailer. He will sell her in 12 days to the highest bidder. Ellen has 12 days to save Shannon, but can she get anyone else to care?<br/><br/>Ellen is an advisor who goes above and beyond for her students. Shannon falls through the cracks on campus but is on Ellen's radar. She gets stellar grades but doesn't speak to her professors. King fakes a relationship to gain her trust. He sees Shannon as an easy mark. Her time in captivity will make your flesh crawl as King taunts, assaults, and belittles her. The movie states race disparities among missing women in the media and offers ways campuses can improve security. Lifetimers can spot the script's foreshadowing, so it eases the ticking clock. Viewers can use this film to teach college-bound students about predator techniques.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
