    "mtitle":"Stolen by My Mother: The Kamiyah Mobley Story",
    "review":"Lexi wants to gain independence by getting a job and making money. Lexi eats her free cake on her 16th birthday and sees her favorite waitress is due any day. She asks if a position will open soon. The waitress tells Lexi the job is hers if she wants it. She can start tomorrow. She just needs to bring in her social security card and fill out the paperwork. Lexi and Gloria get in the car. Gloria tells Lexi to turn down the job offer and return her apron. Lexi doesn't understand and begs Gloria for an explanation. Gloria tells Lexi her real name is Kamiyah Mobley. And she kidnapped Kamiyah from the hospital when she was 8-hours old. Kamiyah's curiosity gets the best of her and she looks up her mother, Sanarah, on the internet. Kamiyah makes one phone call that blows up her world.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Kamiyah Mobley's kidnapping, this movie is a textbook case of Stockholm Syndrome.  This movie is tough because you have more sympathy for Gloria than Sanarah. Remember, Gloria was the kidnapper. While she didn't physically abuse Kamiyah, she mentally abused her. Always remember who was the real criminal before you pass judgment.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Who Wants Me Dead",
    "review":"Carly finishes a photoshoot when she is approached by a lawyer.  Her estranged sister, Nikki, died and left everything to her daughter Zoe. Zoe's guardian will be in charge of the money and Nikki chose Carly to be her guardian.  If she doesn't move and take care of Zoe, Zoe will be placed in the system.  Carly and Nikki grew up in foster care so Carly doesn't want that happening to Zoe.  She flies to the west coast and greets an angry Chris.  Chris was Nikki's husband. In a matter of days, Chris lost his wife, home, and his daughter - because he never formally adopted her. Bumpy at first, Zoe and Carly find their groove.  Then, Carly starts working in Nikki's flower shop with Madison and April.  Things seem to be going great, but Zoe screams at night and believes someone is trying to take her away.  When Carly is told her sister was poisoned, she starts to see things and believes someone is after her.  Can she find her sister's killer before she becomes the next victim?<br/><br/>This gives a fun twist to the Lifetime murder-mystery drama we all know and love with a good body count.  While the killer's motive is typical, you are never sure how many people are involved in the overall scheme.  This keeps you watching and playing along.  Carly's willingness to sacrifice everything to learn the truth and save Zoe is wonderful.  And the conclusion is extremely adult for this type of movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Beautiful Place to Die: A Martha's Vineyard Mysteries",
    "review":"Jeff has retired from the harsh streets of New York to his hometown in Martha's Vineyard. While helping a friend, Jeff hurts his back and goes to the hospital for help.  He can't believe Zee is his doctor. Not only is she the Chief's daughter but she is Jeff's ex-girlfriend. She takes a closer look at his X-ray and sees the cause of his problem.  He was shot a few months earlier and the bullet is still in his back.  It's too close to his spine.  While it's causing him pain, taking it out may cause paralysis. On a whim, Jeff goes to the gala.  On the surface, everything is grand.  But Zee and Jeff see something is brewing.  Peyton has thrown Jackie, a reporter, out of the gala.  Bradley and Stacey are trying to keep Ray away from their dad, Gerald.  Bradley and Ray got into a physical altercation before Jeff broke it up.  The next day, Jeff sees a blue jacket with blood along the cliffs.  As he walks closer to the edge, he sees Ray's body in the water. When Zee declares Ray's death as murder, the Chief asks Jeff to look into the case as a consultant. Jeff's ambition drives him headfirst into the case with Zee right by his side.  Much to the worry of her father, Zee and Jeff will work together to discover who killed Ray.<br/><br/>This movie has a great mix of characters with different but strong motives.  The main characters are introduced to the audience and gives you great sympathy for Zee and Jeff.  Seeing Jeff's trauma makes you want to look deeper into his backstory.  His heart is still in the job, his body is just not there yet.  It will be amazing to see how the writers will deal with his injury in the future.  This new mystery has plenty of potential for growth.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
