    "review":"Dan got his basketball team to the playoffs. His parents, Tim and Martha, beam with joy, and Dan's girlfriend, Kim, can't wait to celebrate. Dan and Kim go to Tim and Martha's house. Dan got a partial athletic scholarship to attend Stanford, and he wants to have a party to celebrate. He asks his parents to get beers. Martha has reservations, but Tim wants to get a keg.<br/><br/>Martha meets with friends to talk about hosting a teen party with alcohol. Joey's mother thinks it's a bad idea, but the other mom thinks it's okay. Dan tells his friends about the party at school. Everyone is excited except Joey. Joey works at the pizza shop every weekend, so he never gets to go. Lisa, Kim, and Nikki will be there, along with people who invite themselves. Kim gets waitlisted, and it breaks her heart. She tells Dan she will get a job near Stanford and save money until she gets accepted.<br/><br/>They go to the party and see Dan with Heather. Dan tells Kim it's over. Kim goes to the living room and gets drunk. Kim finds spare keys in the garage and drives away in Martha's SUV. Nikki gets Joey on the phone and asks him to pick them up. Nikki realizes Kim is not in the house and calls Kim on her phone. Nikki hears that Kim is in distress and then a crash.<br/><br/>Police officers arrive at Martha and Tim's home. The officers tell them their SUV was in an accident, and someone is injured. Kim wakes up in the hospital with Robin by her side. Robin informs Kim that she hit Joey on the way to the party to pick her and her friends up. Joey is still in surgery and may not make it. Kim's blood-alcohol test was over the legal limit. So, the police arrest her. This entire town will have a ripple effect of blame, court cases, and forgiveness.<br/><br/>If you followed the Murdaugh trial, you know this movie holds a sad reality. This tragedy wasn't one girl's poor decision. It was an avalanche of mistakes. Joey had the moral high ground because he didn't attend the party or drink. Tim was too busy trying to be the 'cool parent' and raised a son with zero compassion and no responsibilities. Then they provide kegs to underage teens. Also, Kim bases her life and self-esteem around one guy. Then falls apart when she doesn't get what she 'deserves.' This movie will leave you angry but provides valuable and realistic lessons about drunk driving.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Nurse To Die For",
    "review":"Corrine tries to blow out the candles on her birthday cake, passes out, and goes to the hospital. Her cystic fibrosis caused mucus to clog her lungs and restricts her breathing. Dr. Caldwell tells Corrine's dad, Liam, that Corrine can go home, but Corrine shouldn't go outside or do too much. Dr. Caldwell knows Liam has a demanding work schedule, and his wife, Amy, died in a car accident. So, she suggests Liam hire a home-care nurse for Corrine until her lungs clear.<br/><br/>After several bad candidates, Liam interviews Victoria. Corrine comes downstairs for Victoria's interview and has a coughing fit. Victoria steps in and helps by drumming on Corrine's back. Everyone gives Victoria glowing reviews, and Liam hires her. Liam begrudgingly refocuses on work and gives Victoria the reigns. But when Victoria's story falls apart, and Corrine doesn't get better, will Liam and Corrine survive looking behind Victoria's mask?<br/><br/>This movie doesn't deliver a body count but amplifies the creepy factor. The audience has no idea why Victoria stalks this family until the first hour. And you must pay attention because the why is in a news article. Of course, the protagonists make obvious Lifetime mistakes. They don't double-check with the agency and leave cryptic voice messages. However, Victoria's sneaky ways make this movie watchable if you like yelling at the TV.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"If I Can't Have You",
    "review":"Michelle works late nights on her radio show with her producer, Lily, and sound engineer, Keith. She advises on people's love problems and plays their requests. Michelle got a call during her broadcast from a caller with unrequited love. She tells him to be upfront about his feelings because women like strong, confident men. Their station manager, Stan, sees their numbers rising more in some demographics than others and desires for them to research why. Michelle leaves her meeting with Lily to spend time with her boyfriend, Aiden. Aiden tries to get physical, but she pushes him away and falls asleep.<br/><br/>Michelle leaves for work to find a rose with a note attached. Her neighbor, Mr. Sklar, returns misdelivered mail opened. She warily returns to her home and calls Aiden to show her appreciation for the rose. But he didn't give it to her. Michelle starts her show, and the caller with unrequited love phones again. He took Michelle's advice by leaving a rose at her door. And asks her to play 'If I Can't Have You.' Lily hangs up the call and reports it to Stan. Stan can't do anything about it and tells her it's good for ratings. Michelle tries to escape to work, but the caller phones again. Lily tells Michelle to call the police, Keith says to get a gun, and Aiden thinks marriage is the way. Someone is stalking Michelle but who and why.<br/><br/>Even with Lifetime veterans, nothing can save this movie. The plot is boring, slow, and overdone. The lead character is unlikeable and garners zero compassion. She is asinine, and it will irritate you to your core. This film is one of Lifetime's worst stalker movies. You will beg for a body count that never happens. This tragedy is a waste of talent.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Blessing Bracelet",
    "review":"Justin convinces his mom, Dawn, to celebrate Galentine's Day with her friends. Dawn has been having money problems and doesn't want to be a burden on them. Three years ago, Dawn's husband made bad crypto investments. It put their family deep in debt. They got a divorce, and he hasn't returned since. Dawn could lose her house and car if she doesn't find a second job. Before they go out, Dawn goes through her jewelry box to find accessories. She finds the old Blessing Bracelets she made in high school. Dawn would use the beads to count her blessings in times of stress or worry. Before their Galentine's dinner, Cassie and Dawn see a 'help wanted' sign on the door. Dawn talks to a man about the job. And by coincidence, he is the owner and gives the position to her. Cassie thinks Dawn's blessing bracelet worked. On Dawn's first day, Flancy shows Dawn the ropes. Flancy tells Dawn that she gets more tips by handing out candy. So Dawn decides to give customers blessing bracelets. A customer suggests selling the bracelets and Dawn thinks the bracelets may save her home. Will the bank have faith in her?<br/><br/>Ben works at the local bank but hates his job. His co-worker, Jordana, calls him benevolent Ben. He believed his job would help people achieve their dreams. Not destroy their lives. At the vet, Ben's dog runs up to a woman, Dawn, and he is impressed with her connection to the animal. Ben asks Dawn on a date, but she says no. Later Ben goes to Dawn's 2nd job, and she serves him and his parents. He tells Dawn he works in finance but not at her bank. Dawn has no idea that Ben makes the financial decisions. Since Dawn's paperwork is in her married name, Ben has no idea she is the client. As they date, Dawn keeps counting her blessings. Will this relationship be a blessing in disguise?<br/><br/>This movie, like the bracelets, remind people to acknowledge God for the small miracles. No matter how tiny or insignificant, they could lead to something bigger. It's so easy to focus on the negative. So having a trinket to refocus and repurpose that energy is helpful. This film has a touch of spirituality everyone can use to see the beauty in the world during stressful times. And it reminds you to count your blessings in good times and bad.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
