    "review":"Gabby has a stereotypical suburban life.  Husband, kids, and the white picket fence.  On the inside, she is angry at her husband Elliott.  He secretly got a vasectomy when he knew she wanted another child.  While Elliott is away with their children, Gabby meets Matt.  The two spark of a friendship that becomes a business relationship.  Their texts become more intimate each time they talk.  On a surprise visit, Gabby's emotional affair becomes physical.  Regretful, Gabby draws the line in the sand and tells Matt they are just friends.  That would be true if she wasn't pregnant.  Now she will see the ripple effect of her decision.<br/><br/>You will feel every possible emotion with this new book-to-screen movie.  Gabby is never painted as a victim or a villain.  She is a misguided woman who made a mistake and is trying her best to fix it.  Just keep that in mind before you judge Matt, Elliott, or their children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bailey doesn't have the money to attend a geology project at the Grand Canyon.  Instead, she will be going home for college summer vacation.  At home, her mom, Tina, has made some changes.  She is working out and eating vegan.  Bailey accepts her mom's changes until she sees the reason why.  Hugo, a healthy life consultant, asked Tina to elope and get married.  But Tina could never get married without her daughter.  However, Tina wants to get married this Saturday.  Bailey tries to be excited until a webcam, a wallet, and too friendly hands, forces her to change her mind.  What will it take to get her mom to see Hugo for who he really is?<br/><br/>It's difficult to review a movie you can't hear.  The environment noise, in outdoor scenes, were too loud.  And the backing track drowned out the actors constantly.  The evil stepfather plot was updated with blockchain but you could barely hear it.  The director needs to work with a new sound engineer and editor.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Valentine has an opportunity to save her family's wedding shoe business by designing a shoe for the biggest name in wedding fashion.  But when the dress sketch is less than inspiring, Teodora invites Valentine to go to Italy with her for inspiration.  It's there that Valentine finds her grandmother, inspiration, and love.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Adriana Trigiani, this movie is more complex than others on Lifetime and it offers a healthy dose of reality.  You will notice that Valentine slowly gains confidence, strength, and love for herself when her fears are mirrored by Roman.  And that is the true lesson behind this movie.  In the end, you will want to be her grandmother, Teodora.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

The event planner tells them she has a date, but it's over a year away.  The closest available date is 3 weeks away.  The two decide to take a leap of faith and get married in 3 weeks.  While that's not easy, their families are arriving early to uniquely help.  With meddling, jaded, judging, and extremely different in-laws, will Clay and Laurel make it down the aisle?<br/><br/> The second installment of this series is too funny.  While you feel the happy couple's pain, you can't help but laugh at their parents butting heads.  This movies' realistic view of a wedding is wonderful and it offers practical and fair solutions to their problems.  Watch with the family and your in-laws today.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
