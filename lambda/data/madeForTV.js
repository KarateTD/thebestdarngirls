    "review":"Liv returns to New York hoping to settle back into her everyday life with her friend, Kat, but Kat has a piece of good news.  After several months of dating, Kat got engaged to Dylan.

She will schedule the party at a working ranch to convince Kat that ranch life isn't for Kat.<br/><br/>Liv slowly reveals the ranch's focus but not her master plan after they arrive.  However, Kat's gung-ho spirit confuses Liv.  Liv meets the owner, Wade, and Wade's son, Travis.
