"mtitle":"Thank God: Christmas at Keller Ranch",
"review":"Greg, manager for hockey player Wes, worries that Wes isn't healing fast enough. It's been months since Wes's injury, but he still walks with a cane. Greg heard about a ranch in Nashville that focuses on equine therapy. He begs Wes to give it a try. Wes says no, but Greg calls.<br/><br/>Maggie runs the Keller Ranch, but it's losing money, and she's behind on the bills. Her assistant, Laurie, thinks renting out the barn and taking new clients will help, but Maggie refuses. Maggie wants to focus on her son, Dawson, this holiday. It's the first Christmas since his dad's passing. Then, Laurie gets a call from Greg. He wants Maggie to train Wes. Maggie says no until Greg offers triple for his player. When Maggie hears the word 'player,' she asks for the client's name. Wes is Dawson's favorite athlete. She agrees to Greg's conditions. She has three weeks to get Wes on the ice while bonding with Dawson. Will Wes be ready in time?<br/><br/>Inspired by Thank God by Kane Brown and Katelyn Brown, this film isn't as religious as the title suggests. The movie is slow, with Greg and Maggie holding secrets on the tip of their tongue while exploring the town. Their connection to Dawson is intriguing. The writers carefully introduced us to their struggles early so audiences wouldn't judge Dawson too harshly. This film is sentimental and romantic, but the lulls outweigh the entertainment.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle":"Christmas in Alaska",
"review":"Co-workers Megan and Oliver attend a meeting. Their boss, Kate, wants to step down and name her successor for editor-in-chief. However, she has two superb candidates to choose from: Oliver and Megan. They pitch the same idea for a non-traditional place to spend the holiday. It's Tokyo, Japan. Megan pulls Kate aside because she wanted to spend the holidays with her son, Daniel. Kate informs her that an editor-in-chief must be flexible. So, Megan agrees to go.<br/><br/>Their flight makes an emergency landing in Alaska. They can't find a flight or a hotel to accommodate them. So, Oliver relents and states he knows a place. They drive to the Aurora Inn, and the owner, Samantha, greets him with a knowing smile. Oliver admits to Megan that Samantha is his sister. Megan wants to know more, but Oliver refuses to talk about it.<br/><br/>Megan and Oliver try to go to Tokyo, but there are zero flights. So they contact Kate. Kate says Alaska is close enough to the North Pole, so they will pivot like a great editor-in-chief. They will discuss all the fun activities you can do near Santa. Megan and Oliver agree to the switch, but both have reservations. Megan hates being away from Daniel, and Oliver doesn't want to confront his family's issues. They will deal with their problems and gain so much more.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about this movie. The writers describe Megan as an uptight, workaholic who struggles with work-life balance. Oliver is a free spirit who hides from family issues. However, both are excellent at their job. The movie is less about their competition and more about overcoming family problems and expectations. This film has a few funny moments within the standard plot. It's not boring, but it's not DVR-worthy either.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle":"A Runaway Bride Christmas",
"review":"Emma calls her sister, Nikki, before her Christmas wedding. She ran away from her last wedding after having second thoughts, but she feels good about marrying Ryan. Nikki reassures Emma that she's making the correct decision. Emma ends the call and walks downstairs. She overhears Ryan expressing his doubts to his groomsmen. His thoughts are unfiltered and unbelievable. She calls off the wedding and runs out the front door.<br/><br/>Emma runs to her car and tries to open the door. Mitch, recognizing Emma from high school, asks why she's breaking into his car. She says it's the vehicle she rented and shows him the reservation on her phone. He laughs because it's for the right city, but the wrong state. He offers her a ride to Nikki's home.<br/><br/>Nikki embraces Emma. They commiserate over Emma's second failed wedding. Emma feels like a hypocrite because she's a life coach who doesn't have her life together. Nikki has an idea to help. The school fundraiser isn't going well because it's centered around their failing basketball team, coached by Mitch. Nikki wants Emma to help Mitch guide the team to a winning season using her life-coaching skills. Emma agrees. Nikki warns Emma to be careful because she knows Emma had a crush on Mitch in high school. Emma tells Nikki she's over her teenage fantasies, and it will be all business. Is Emma right?<br/><br/>This film is captivating because of the relationship between Mitch and his son, Owen. The writers made them the heart of the storyline. It makes the relationship between Mitch and Emma more believable. It's romantic, charming, and wonderful. The added stress about the fundraiser is a time filler. This movie encourages conversations about father-and-son bonding and what's deemed acceptable. Otherwise, this picture won't capture your full attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle":"My Mother the Madam",
"review":"Lauren cries at her father's funeral. Police Chief Jon was so proud of his daughter's journalism career. As she sobs, Lauren deals with her mother, Elizabeth, trying to set her up on a date. Lauren brushes her off and continues with the services. Lauren admits she's experiencing more stress than normal. Since Jon died from a heart attack, she worries about something happening to her. Elizabeth tells Lauren to see her old pediatrician, Dr. Melanie McEntire. Lauren scoffs but takes Elizabeth's advice.<br/><br/>During her appointment, Lauren expresses her concerns about hereditary heart diseases. Melanie tells Lauren that she should manage her stress better, but Jon's heart problems won't concern her because she's adopted. Lauren does a double-take. Melanie apologizes for the slip-up as Lauren runs out the door. Lauren confronts Elizabeth about her birth mother. Elizabeth explains that her mother was the town's madam and an addict. But something doesn't sit right with Lauren. She enters Jon's office and goes through his papers. She finds her birth certificate with her birth mother's name, Jean. She wants to meet Jean and know the truth. Lauren will uncover the seedy underbelly of the town and the puppet master behind it all.<br/><br/>This film is a wild, pearl-clutching good time. It brings viewers back to old-school Lifetime. With outlandish plots, devious characters, and several bodies, the script has everything for you. First, everyone in this town is in each other's bedrooms. Second, there are only a few 'morally good' characters. Third, the conclusion leaves room for a part two, and a sequel with the same writers will be greatly appreciated. While you may scream at the ending, it's worth the ride.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle":"Single on the 25th",
"review":"Nell receives Christmas cards from her friends and family. She sees happy marriages, engagements, and baby announcements. She's happy for them, but has nothing to report on her life. She tells her best friend, Julia, that she created a schedule for her family's visit during the holidays. Then, Julia announces that she's expecting, and Nell jumps for joy. She can't wait to share this information with her family. Until they call her and cancel plans. Julia extends an offer for Nell to spend the holidays with her family, but Nell doesn't want to intrude.<br/><br/>Nell starts her holiday with takeout. She steps outside to get it, but the door closes behind her. She is locked out because she forgot her key. Nell asks her handsome neighbor, Cooper, to buzz her inside the apartment building. He does. Nell knocks on Cooper's door, and he lets her inside. She groans and admits Christmas plans are ruined. Cooper tells her to enjoy the holiday as a single woman. This time of year doesn't have to be dreadful if you have fun. Nell declares that she will do everything she planned with her family alone, but asks for his help. He agrees. They will be alone together on the 25th.<br/><br/>Inspired by the song Single on the 25th by Lauren Spencer, this movie starts with a promising premise of self-discovery. After the 10th complaint, it feels like whining or self-loathing. The movie can help others deal with their singleness during a romantic holiday. It shows viewers how to handle intrusive questions and uncomfortable parties with class and style. Once Nell has fun, the film becomes enjoyable. Sadly, it takes too long to get there.<br/><br/>* out of 5 stars.",
