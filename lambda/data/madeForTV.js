    "review":"This year is the first the Jenkins will have without their patriarch, Bernard.  His daughters, Beverly and Baneatta, want to get the family together to celebrate Christmas and his life.  Bernard was a pastor, but Baneatta's husband, James, took over the church.  As James mulls over the Christmas sermon, Beverly gets a phone call from Bernard's estate lawyer.  Bernard provided another inheritance if his entire family got together on Christmas. As she prepares the house for the family, Baneatta hears a knock at the door.  A woman gives Baneatta the basket and introduces herself as Baneatta's sister.  But it's not Beverly; it's Brianna.  Brianna tells Baneatta that her mother had an affair with Bernard, and she knows about the money.  Brianna thinks Baneatta will let her in, but she gets the door slammed in her face.  Baneatta wants to keep her father's legacy untarnished so she will leave her family in the dark.  To create a perfect holiday, Baneatta enforces her will on everyone in the family while neglecting their feelings.  What will it take for the family to get Baneatta in line?<br/><br/>This family holds so many secrets that the bed montage is heartbreaking. But like most first ladies of the church, Baneatta gave into the sin of vanity. This family drama will serve the tea while pulling you into the story.  While the views are cliché by today's standards, the overall theme rings true.  In the end, holidays with your family will be a breeze.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
