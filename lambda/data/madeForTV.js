    "mtitle": "Sister Wife Murder",
    "review": "Chloe's mother, Lois, yells at Chloe to wake up for work. Since Chloe's father died, Chloe's life has been in a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol, and parties. Lois won't allow Chloe to lay around the house. She tells Chloe to get out of bed, get a job, and attend church.<br/><br/>Chloe gazes at Caleb preaching the word at the pulpit and becomes entranced. Afterward, Caleb pulls Chloe aside and discusses ways she can get involved in the church. Also, he runs a foundation called Sacred Heart, which helps needy families. He offers Chloe a job, and she says yes.<br/><br/>Margo meets Chloe at Sacred Heart and shows Chloe around the office. Chloe meets with her friends, Alexis and Dalton, and drones about Caleb. Alexis reminds Chloe he is a married man. Chloe laughs because she was only looking.<br/><br/>Chloe gets familiar with Sacred Heart while spending time with Caleb. Soon, Caleb and Chloe become intimate. However, Chloe doesn't want to be his dirty secret and wants to know if they have a future. Caleb explains that his wife, Anna, knows about their relationship. Chloe pretends to accept the arrangement, but her jealousy grows. Later, Caleb asks Chloe to skip Alexis's party for a retreat. He convinces Chloe to say yes.<br/><br/>Chloe shares her hardships with the retreat attendees and connects with Anna and Caleb. Chloe wakes at night and walks around the canteen. She finds Caleb kissing Margo and runs out of the room. Caleb admits he is married to Margo and Anna and wants Chloe to join their family. They invite Chloe to dinner to meet everyone and see how they live. After dinner, Chloe leaves home, marries Caleb, and becomes a sister-wife. She believes she is following God's path. But the devil has her fooled, and one sister-wife pays the ultimate price.<br/><br/>This movie spends time on character development to make Chloe's change from party girl to sister-wife believable. Once Chloe is in the home, it doesn't take long for cracks to form. Your skin will crawl when Caleb defends his abusive actions with the bible. Then, you will wait for each woman to see the light. This film is entertaining, but the murder takes time because of well-written character development.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Then, Shane and Oliver notice something on the wall: the 2017 Great Mailbox Breach letters. The POstables can't contain their excitement and open the first letter to find the owner. Someone sent it to Maria. The sender reprimanded Maria for her actions and suggested that jail is a better option to help Maria build character.

Charley arrives with Eleanor, and Norman offers to take the baby for a walk. The POstables realize Charley went to the same school as Maria. They question her, but Charley doesn't have answers. Then, Charley admits to the group that the breach was her fault. She and her friends, Marlon and Barry, like to play pranks.

    "mtitle": "Deadly Wives Club",
    "review": "Jack gets a fabulous opportunity to work at a better company for more money, and his wife, Anita, is excited until she learns they must move. Anita is socially awkward and hasn't been able to make friends after their daughter, Jilly, got better. Jack assures Anita it will be easy because their new neighborhood has a country club with events. After Anita agrees, they get a call from their social worker, Kendra. Kendra asks Anita to consider opening Jilly's adoption, but Anita vehemently refuses.<br/><br/>Jack and Anita move to Predator's Ridge with Jilly. Anita and Jilly eat treats while window shopping, and Anita loses sight of Jilly. Anita frantically searches for Jilly and finds Jilly talking to Marti. Marti and the other wives want to welcome Jack and Anita to the neighborhood with a party at Joy's house. Anita agrees.<br/><br/>Anita admits to having an emotional affair, her social anxiety, and Jilly's illness in one conversation at the party. She apologizes for talking too much and asks for water. Anita walks into the garage for water and finds a ladder with a fixed rung. Then, the garage door slams shut and locks. She screams for help until Sarah opens it. Later, Anita finds a photo of four women together. It's Joy, Marti, Sarah, and Patrice. Sadly, Patrice died years ago.<br/><br/>Jack and Anita eat with his boss, Hank, and Hank's wife, Bonnie. Bonnie gushes about moving away from the wives club because she thinks they got away with murder. During a party, Patrice fell off a ladder, obtaining a frisbee. The police said it was an accident, but Bonnie blames the wives.<br/><br/>Later, Anita has dinner with Joy, Sarah, and Marti. They commiserate about their husbands and give Anita a gold TWC pin. While the acronym means many things, one rule holds: loyalty has no limits. They ask Anita to join, and she graciously says yes. Anita believes this is the first step of friendship, but should she heed Bonnie's warning?<br/><br/>Anita has zero survival skills. So, your frustration will grow watching her. The wives are worse than gangs. However, their foundation is shaky. The wrap-up has a lot of action around the culprit's monologue, so piecing the motive together is complex. Also, you need to remember two key characters from the beginning of the script. The film may be confusing, but it's a captivating watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Couples Retreat Murder",
    "review": "Rebecca leaves her home and drives to a bar after arguing with her husband, Jim. Rebecca tells her friend, Paulina, that Jim's work motivation has become an obsession since he got a new job. Rebecca confesses that she admires Paulina's relationship with Paulina's husband, Phil. Paulina admits that she and Phil attend couples retreats to help their marriage and encourages Rebecca to attend the next retreat at Lotusland.<br/><br/>Rebecca looks up the retreat in the morning and convinces Jim to attend and save their marriage. Jim relents and drives there. On the road, Rebecca admits this trip was Paulina's idea. Jim pulls over and screams because he doesn't like Phil. Frustrated, Jim agrees to keep up appearances for their marriage.<br/><br/>Counselor Alan greets Jim and Rebecca. After the other couples arrive, they learn the rules. The retreat removes their phones and doesn't have meat or alcohol, so the couples can focus on each other without being weighed down or distracted. Jim, a lawyer, scoffs but gives in. The couples hope this will reignite their relationships, but someone will die.<br/><br/>Lifetimers will rejoice when Rebecca discovers that she has cell service at the remote retreat. When Alan takes their phones, it dashes your hopes. It's the first sign that things will go wrong. The editors made one flaw by having a commercial break during the culprit's monologue. It makes the confession disjointed and distracting. Experiences Lifetimers will spot inappropriate behavior, brief interactions, and glances throughout the film. This movie is a solvable mystery with a comfortable motive, and it fills the holes during the conclusion. However, viewers must assume the survivor is okay.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Amish Affair",
    "review": "Hannah finds Aaron waiting for her at the train station. He takes her in his horse and buggy to his home that he shares with his wife, Sarah, and daughters, Rachel and Grace. Hannah inquires if the congregation knows about her sorted past. While the police cleared Hannah, her Amish community didn't. Aaron believes Sarah has ALS, but she refuses to see a doctor or take modern medicine. Hannah eats dinner and settles in for the night. She will take over Sarah's household duties while caring for Sarah.<br/><br/>Hannah is working in the barn when Aaron approaches her. She rejects his advances earlier but gives in to temptation. However, Hannah stops the affair after watching the tribunal shun Miriam for tempting a married man. Soon, Hannah meets two of Aaron's employees, Jacob and Laura. He asks Hannah out on a date, infuriating Aaron. Aaron tells Jacob about Hannah's past to coerce Jacob to break up with Hannah. To Aaron's surprise, Hannah still won't date Aaron while Sarah is alive. Days later, Sarah dies, and Aaron turns to Hannah for comfort. The police investigate after hearing about Hannah's past. When gossip spreads around the small community, Hannah must discover the truth or lose her freedom.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie slowly entices viewers into a sexy murder plot. While the audience knows the killer, you will be unsure when the crime started. Aaron uses Hannah's fears to push her into a relationship with him. And her community solidifies her concerns by shunning Mariam. While the conclusion gives the characters a happy ending, it's obvious the community's mindset doesn't change about who they punish. This film will whet your appetite.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
