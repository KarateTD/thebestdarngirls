    "review": "Lauren works with her friend Rae when she gets a notification from her dream school. Lauren believes it's her acceptance letter, but the notification's link doesn't load. Lauren calls her mother, Julia, to check. So, Julia checks the mailbox and finds an acceptance letter. Lauren jumps for joy until she goes home. She overhears her parents arguing about the cost. Lauren's father doesn't want to saddle her with loans. So, they will encourage Lauren to apply for more grants and scholarships.<br/><br/>Lauren discusses her options with Rae when she remembers a customer, Helena, who had come into the caf√© the day before. Helena was in the pageant circuit with Julia. Julia used her winnings to pay for school. Lauren researches a local pageant and discovers that Miss Teen Starfire's registration will open soon. The grand prize is $50,000. Lauren thinks this is an easy win for her future. However, she will let her school, work, and friendship suffer. As Lauren faces harassment, corruption, and intimidation, Rae will fight for her life. Will they come out on top?<br/><br/>This movie starts with a devious pageant plot. However, viewers should remember that GSK sponsored this film. They can advertise their vaccine while entertaining. However, the advertisement takes too long and is too late. If you need a backstabbing pageant story, allow yourself two hours for this one. But only if you can look past the 15-minute ad.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Dean and Iris award Lena with the contract to redecorate four of their hotels. She finalized her divorce today and needed to smile. Iris and Dean look at each other and suggest another deal. They both like Lena and invite her to be a third in their marriage.<br/><br/>Lena meets with her friend, Kathy, for coffee. Kathy knows about the famous couple as Lena tells Kathy about their proposition. Kathy inquires if Lena will take it, and Lena confirms. Lena asks Kathy to watch her daughter, Madison, while she goes on a date with Iris and Dean. Recently, Madison's school called because Madison missed several days of school. In turn, Lena is using supervision as a punishment.<br/><br/>Lena has a great date with Iris and Dean, and they invite her back to their home. Lena spends the night with Iris and Dean. Lena wakes up to an empty bed. She puts on her clothes and tiptoes down the stairs. She enters the kitchen and finds Iris in a pool of blood. Lena calls 9 1 1 and waits for the detectives to arrive.<br/><br/>Detective Michaels arrives at Lena's home to question her about her relationship with Iris and Dean. Madison eavesdrops on the stairs to give them a semblance of privacy. But when the detective's questions become too invasive, Madison runs downstairs. She warns Lena to obtain a lawyer and demands the detective leave. Internet sleuths believe Lena murdered Iris. Lena tells Madison to ignore it because it will all blow over. Besides, she has one person in her corner: Dean. But something about Dean rubs Madison the wrong way. Can she find the proof before Lena falls in love?<br/><br/>This film is uncomfortable to watch because Lena is too old to be making these mistakes. Luckily, Madison has a good head on her shoulders and suspects everyone. Lifetimers will see the writing on the wall, so this film isn't a mystery. The writing and plot is unorginal for Lena's character, but highlights Madison. For the first time, Lifetimers will cheer for the ill-mannered teen and her sweet boyfriend. Otherwise, this film will anger you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery",
    "review": "Hannah helps a well-dressed customer, Victoria, at the counter when Hannah's mother, Delores, enters and gives Victoria a death glare. Victoria orders four banana cream pies, makes a quip towards Delores, and exits. Delores explains that Victoria is her competition. Hannah laughs and promises to come to Delores's opening performance.<br/><br/>Hannah and her sister, Andrea, arrive at the Murrayville theater and meet the manager, Tonya. Tonya gushes over Victoria because Victoria has a dedicated fan base that ensures the theater will stay in business. Hannah and Andrea agree not to tell Delores. Hannah bumps into Victoria's nephew, Roger. The sculptor is uninterested in the theater or Delores's performance. Hannah and Andrea sit and watch the play.<br/><br/>Later, Hannah brings the pies to Victoria's home and sees Victoria on the ground. She drops the pies, breaks a window, and enters the home. She checks Victoria's pulse, but it's too late. Hannah smells something burning and runs to the stove. She finds an empty frying pan on top of a burner set to high flame. She turns off the burner and calls 9 1 1 for help.<br/><br/>Sheriff Ron surveys the scene with several officers and A.D.A Chad. He takes Hannah's statement but warns her to stay off the case. However, things change when Ron makes Delores his number one suspect. Hannah has to uncover the dark secrets in Victoria's life to prove her mother's innocence.<br/><br/>Based on Banana Cream Pie Murder by Joanne Fluke, this movie gives Hallmarkies the scene we are begging for: a kiss between Hannah and Chad. This film also expands on Hannah's assistant's life. This mystery is easier for Hallmarkies to uncover, but it delivers funny, inspirational, and loving moments. So have your banana bundt cake and butterscotch crunch cookies ready. You will keep this on your DVR.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Home to Die For",
    "review": "Anna's book sales are down, and she's reeling from her divorce proceedings. Her friend, Crystal, suggests Anna take a vacation. Anna confesses that money is tight. Crystal knows a way to save money: a home swap. She tells Anna about the WanderNest website. She can swap homes with another person for free.<br/><br/>Anna tries the website and matches with a woman named Aurora from Greece. The only catch is that Aurora is coming to Los Angeles tomorrow. Anna throws caution to the wind and books a flight. When her estranged husband, David, calls, she chooses to keep the trip a secret.<br/><br/>Anna arrives in Greece and makes herself at home in Aurora's place. Then, Anna hears something fall. She grabs a weapon and walks toward the sound. Anna screams when she sees Niko in the living room. Aurora asked him to keep an eye on Anna. Anna puts down the weapon and gets travel tips from the handsome stranger. Anna thinks Greece is a much-needed refresh. However, she is in someone's crosshairs. Will Anna survive her trip?<br/><br/>This potential Hallmark movie comes with a surprising twist that experienced Lifetimers won't see coming. The director changed this with a gray overlay. Viewers know something more sinister will happen to Anna. This picture disappoints with the motive. It's out of step. However, it doesn't take away from the stalker's shock value. Viewers should watch this before someone ruins the twist.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
