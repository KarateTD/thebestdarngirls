    "mtitle":"Merry Liddle Christmas Wedding",
    "review":"Jacquie works side by side with her wedding planner, Garrett, to make her Winter Wonderland wedding come true.  She is ready to marry the man of her dreams, Tyler, but his kids, Coco and Josh, haven't warmed up to her, although his parents have.  As she sits with Tyler and his family, she gets a text that her family arrived early. Her mom and dad come with a van full of gifts, decorations, and a tree.  Her sister, Treena, and Treena's husband, Julian, come with their daughter, Ava, but leave their baby at home.  And Jacquie's baby sister, Kiara, left her dog at home and her son with his dad.  Jacquie pleads with her family to stay on their best behavior and away from Garrett. Later, Garrett bumps into Kiara and Mrs. Liddle, and they continue to tell him how to decorate.  When Jacquie walks in, Garrett quits and takes his vendors.  Jacquie tries to run after him but smashes into the cake instead.  Seeing the emotional pain in Jacquie's face, Mrs. Liddle calls a family meeting.  She asks her family and Tyler's family to band together to create the wedding of Jacquie's dreams in 3 days.  Can it be done with this family?<br/><br/>This Merry Liddle Christmas sequel is full of the same family hijinks, drama, and love. While you will blame one person for being the source of the disaster, that person tries hard to mend everything, figuratively and literally.  Though you may not handle the situation the way Jacquie did, she did it the only way she knows how: with grace, dignity, and love. At the end of this movie, you will only have one question: when will someone start watching those meddling kids.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Benevolent Lucy races home to see her family, but gets a shock first because there is a sign in the front yard that reads, Ralston Inn Bed and Breakfast.  While she and her siblings, Will and Amber, lived their lives, their father converted their family home into a B and B..  Her father, Ted, started to feel alone with them gone, so he created the B and B to get more activity in the house.  With a little nudging, Ted admits the B and B isn't doing well.  All three siblings decided to come together to help Ted get the B and B on track.  Lucy thinks they need Bea Turner to write a review.  Lucy believes she's in town, but Ted deduces she will be staying at another, more successful hotel.  Plus, how would it look for a reviewer to come to a B and B with no guests? As Lucy devises a plan, a woman rolls into the driveway with a flat tire.  Her name is Beth Thompson, but Lucy sees the initials B.T. on her purse, and she believes the woman is Bea Turner, undercover.  Lucy runs inside the house and tells her siblings to pretend to be guests. The entire family agrees, and everyone, but Amber, plays their role as Beth checks into the B and B..  Instead, Amber introduces herself as the chef.  While performing the ruse, Jake walks into the B and B check-in also.  Lucy remembers Jake from the bakery because they had a knowledge-off about sassafras and candy canes, and he was the winner, but he gave her the sassafras candy cane.  The family will work hard to appease Beth and get a 5-star rating in her review.<br/><br/>Give it up for Grandma and Grandpa.  These two comic reliefs are worth the price of admission and the snacks. But two surprises come out of this movie: Amber's talent and Bea Turner.  The script pushes the love story between Jake and Lucy in the background so you can enjoy the family helping Ted. But this reviewer wants to know, did you see the twist coming?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dear Christmas",
    "review":"Natalie wraps up episode one of her Dear Christmas segment of her Holiday Love podcast, and she plans to finish it in her hometown, Lake Tahoe. Natalie can't wait to get home, but on the way, she gets a flat tire.  The tow company sends Mr. Christmas, who has hot cocoa, decorations, and Christmas music in his car.  She believes they met, but he says he has a familiar face.  Back at her parents' home, Natalie and her sister, Emma, realize they are simple guests now. The sisters look through Natalie's old stuff and find years of diaries, dating back to the 1st grade.  Natalie looks through her 1st-grade diary and reads a history of failed love interest. For Natalie, this is proof of her romance-challenged life.  In the morning, Mr. Christmas wakes her up because he is putting up Christmas decorations next to her window.  They wanted to open the store on time, so her parents, Randy and Jenny, hired Mr. Christmas to put up their decorations.  With a budding attraction, Natalie offers to help.  As they work on the house, Mr. Christmas reveals that his name is Chris Massey, and they were in the 8th-grade band together. Later, at a café, they discover they traveled to the same places but only a day or two apart. As Natalie watch stories of true love, she wonders if this is their love story in the making.  Natalie can only get the answer in her 8th-grade diary.  If only she could find it.<br/><br/>This movie is a cute story about star-crossed lovers with little to no drama. However, you will look forward to the mystery the 8th-grade diary could unlock for them.  As said before, with so many movies this season, this one will be lost and forgotten.  It's a Hallmark movie on Lifetime, nothing more.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
