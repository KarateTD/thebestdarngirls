    "mtitle": "My Amish Double Life",
    "review": "Emma runs to get trowels to dig sweet onions with her father, Mr. Miller. Emma says hello to her mother, Mrs. Miller, as she grabs the trowels and returns to an empty field. She searches for her father and finds him dead. Then, Emma looks and sees someone running away.<br/><br/>As the family mourns the loss of their patriarch, Bishop David arrives for the family's land documents. David tells Mrs. Miller he will handle the land to ease her burden, but Emma thinks David should focus on telling the community to work with the police. David reminds Emma that she has a place in the Amish community and should hold her tongue.<br/><br/>Emma finds her friend, Rebecca, in the woods. Rebecca sneaks into the English world and has a secret phone. Emma goes to Sunday service to plead for the congregation's help, but they sit silent. Emma exhaustingly sighs. She meets Rebecca in the woods and decides to go to the English world for fun.<br/><br/>Emma and Rebecca go to the club with fake IDs. They dance and enjoy the music. Emma exits the restroom, and a man bothers her. Heath scares the man off and dances with Emma. Heath asks Emma to meet him at a specific place and time. Emma returns home with stars in her eyes and a thirst for the English world.<br/><br/>Emma, with Rebecca's help, meets with Heath. They don't want the evening to end, so Heath invites Emma to his home. After a few minutes, Heath gets a call from work. He has to leave tonight. He invites Emma to stay until he returns. Then, she hears a noise and investigates. She finds a woman dead on the floor. She washes her hands, grabs her clothes and the murder weapon, and leaves. Emma burns the clothing, and Rebecca helps Emma bury the scythe.<br/><br/>Days later, the police go to David's home. They are looking for an Amish woman, so David rings the bell and demands the young Amish women step forward. Heath looks at them and points at Emma for killing his wife. Emma must use her wits to uncover who framed her for murdering Heath's wife and the person who murdered her father.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this mystery is gripping and tantalizing. The settings use natural light and practical sets to bring viewers into the Amish way of life. It's contrary to the English world of bright lights and loud music. The costume designer made the same changes to Emma's clothes. And Emma, unlike other heroines, has a reason to lack street smarts. She trusts others to be open and honest and doesn't know how to navigate within the English world. This mystery will keep you guessing until the final twist at the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Wrong Obsession",
    "review": "Dr. Madden counsels Paula and Jake about their relationship. Paula expresses that Jake is still obsessed with his college ex-girlfriend, Lisa. Paula discovered that Jake got a job at Lisa's employer. Jake breaks up with Paula during the session.<br/><br/>Lisa arrives at work, and her co-worker, Joanne, alerts Lisa that Penny left the company. Penny was the marketing director, and now Lisa wants her job. Lisa's boss, Sabrina, calls Lisa into her office. She wants Lisa to take up Penny's slack while Sabrina looks for a replacement. Then, Sabrina says they have a new employee. She wants Lisa to help him get acclimated. Lisa sees Jake, remembers their college days, and laughs.<br/><br/>Lisa tells Jake that she's married to Mark. However, she doesn't mention the issues in her marriage. Jake talks about his breakup but not the therapy sessions. Lisa believes Jake will be a great addition to the company. However, he will turn her life upside down. He is a dangerous man with horrific intentions.<br/><br/>It's been a while since Lifetime offered a movie in The Wrong series, and this film doesn't disappoint. It's as wild and entertaining as the others. The only character with a lick of sense is Sabrina. Lisa doesn't heed Mark's warnings about Jake. Mark allows Jake to lure him into traps, and the police do nothing. Jake is the perfect dose of crazy. He charms just as he gaslights. The outfits are stunning. The script will make you chuckle, scream, and cringe. While this film has a low body count, it's everything you expect and need from the series. And yes, your favorite actress will give you the tagline.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "I'll be Home for National Margarita Day",
    "review": "Lizzy didn't get promoted to partner at her law firm and drinks margaritas to forget. When her bartender charges her $30 for one drink, Lizzy scoffs. Her hometown, Ferguson Falls, loves celebrating National Margarita Day and making the world's best drinks. The bartender tells Lizzy to go there if she hates the drinks so much. So she does.<br/><br/>Lizzy arrives and sees her ex-boyfriend, Sam, tending bar. She broke up with Sam to go to law school in the big city. They catch up, and Sam asks her to revamp their Lime Time Duet for the Margarita Day Talent Show at the Community Center in 5 days. Lizzy says no. Later, Sam overhears Terrence on the phone. Terrence is a developer and wants to demolish the community center on Margarita Day to build condos. Sam alerts the town, and Lizzy offers her legal expertise. Can they save the community center while falling in love?<br/><br/>Lifetimers can look at this special presentation one of two ways. It's the shortest holiday movie ever or the lengthiest Chili's commercial. Either way, it proves the 2-hour running time on any holiday movie is unnecessary. They hit all the major plot points and had a decorating montage. This movie parody is perfect for the holiday movie cynic.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Date at Your Own Risk",
    "review": "Attorney Eva has lunch with her best friend, Jessa. Eva admits that she will have brunch with Raina. Raina is Eva's ex-fianc√©'s mother. Eva tells Jessa about a bad date she went on recently. Jessa asks if Eva performed recon on her date. Then she shows Eva a private group called 'Does He Belong to Anyone.' Women share photos of potential dates for help or warn women about bad encounters. Later that night, Eva scans her dating app matches, avoids losers with the site, and finds a date.<br/><br/>Eva meets with Raina for brunch, but Raina has a surprise: Will. Will left New York and returned to Chicago. She discovers that Will lives across the street and extends a neighborly olive branch. After her date, Eva sees Will arguing with a woman outside of his building.<br/><br/>Eva and her mother meet with Raina and Will for Raina's birthday. When alone, Will apologizes for ghosting Eva after she chose to go to Harvard. Eva asks him about the woman from the night before. Will tells Eva that the woman is Zuri. Zuri started harassing Will after they broke up. Eva takes the trash outside, and Zuri confronts her. She warns Eva to stay away from Will and runs away.<br/><br/>Curiosity gets the better of Eva, and she checks the website. She finds the picture of a man named Mike. However, Mike looks a lot like Will. Several women claim he stalked and assaulted them. She wants to inform Will, but Jessa stops her because the site will kick Eva out of the group. However, Will's behavior makes her wonder if the women are telling the truth. Who can Eva trust?<br/><br/>First, the costume and wardrobe department took over this film. They made sure everyone looked timeless. The hair and make-up department ensured everyone looked beautiful. The script shows how Eva retreats from Raina and Will's quips. Eva is confident in the courtroom but lacks the same self-esteem in her personal life. The plot tries to be a mystery but falls short of expectations. Also, the culprit's motive will make your eyes roll. When the credits roll, the viewer will have one intriguing question: What happened to Zuri? This movie is a guilty pleasure film that falters in the middle.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Return to Office",
    "review": "Liv prepares her matcha, makes oatmeal, and dresses from the waist up for her morning meeting. She wants a promotion to Vice President, but her boss, Walter, will focus on their new acquisition of Artist Access. Tom is the head artist and CEO of Artist Access. He loses track of time and joins the meeting five minutes late. He's excited to join Omega Tech and grow his brand. Walter announces they will return to the office. Walter will have 50% of the staff return on Mondays and Wednesdays and the other half on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Fridays, everyone will work from home. Tom jumps for joy, but Liv cringes.<br/><br/>Liv arrives on Monday and is looking for an office space. She will share her desk with another person for the two days she's not there. Liv leaves a succulent and a note for her deskmate signed as Ms. Monday.<br/><br/>Tom arrives at work on Tuesday and reads Liv's note. He then puts up drawings, a rubber duckie, and YInMn Blue paper. Tom draws a few designs, but they don't inspire him, so Tom throws them in and around the trash can. He leaves a note for Liv and signs it as Mr. Tuesday. She leaves another note but is more formal and aggressive. In response, Tom puts her succulent in the drawer along with a sandwich. On Tuesday, he apologizes for the sandwich. Tom put it in the drawer because someone moved his trash can. He puts out her succulent as a peace offering with another note. In turn, Liv puts up his artwork and duckie. They become pen pals but choose to remain anonymous.<br/><br/>Liv and Tom have their first in-person meeting at a company all-hands. They exchange brief hellos, but Liv wants to focus because she will present the new initiative for Artist Access for Walter. Liv makes an impassioned speech and announces she wants to change the Artist Access logo. She has a 4-point plan, but Walter cuts her off. He puts Liv in charge and ends the meeting. Tom approaches Walter because design changes should go through him. If Liv succeeds, Walter promises her promotion to Vice President of Omega. She promises to let Tom take the design lead while she handles the focus groups. Tom agrees. While they work together on the new logo, they quietly fall in love via Post-Its. Will their love continue when they reveal their identities?<br/><br/>This movie turns lemons into lemonade. It finds the upside to returning to the office while keeping a healthy distance. Their anonymity helps them be honest and understanding. The writers didn't wait until the last minute to reveal their truth. They have Tom and Liv discover their identities through a mutual source. It's comedic gold. As artificial intelligence enters the plot, Tom and Liv's potential relationship breaks down. This film gives an interesting twist on real-world issues while entertaining. It's a must-watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
