    "review":"Olivia wilts under Malcolm's control after losing her son, Mal, and defers everything to Malcolm. She looks to Malcolm when Alicia comes back, breaking their agreement. Malcolm is furious until learning Alicia has cancer. She wants Malcolm to care for her son, Christopher, like they are caring for her daughter, Corrine. Malcolm says yes. Within months, Olivia gets a letter from Christopher stating that Alicia died and he is coming.<br/><br/>Corrine focuses on her debutante ball. She wants a new dress from town, not one of Malcolm's mother's dresses. Olivia tells Corrine to talk to Malcolm. Corrine plays her father like a fiddle and gets Joel to drive her. While discussing stockings, Corrine takes hers off and flings it. A handsome stranger picks it up and hands it to Corrine. Corrine and the man flirt until he leaves. Christopher walks into Foxworth Hall, and Olivia introduces him to Joel and Corrine as their uncle. However, Corrine recognizes Christopher as her handsome stranger.<br/><br/>Joel plays the piano, much to Malcolm's chagrin, but Malcolm doesn't know that Joel serenades his lover, Harry. They talk about running away together, but they don't have money. So Joel gives Harry an expensive watch and a kiss. Malcolm walks in, sees the kiss, and walks out. Malcolm vows to fix it. When Joel and Harry ask for Olivia's support, she consults Malcolm.<br/><br/>Olivia becomes a willing participant in Malcolm's control over her family. It takes torture for Olivia to see the error in her ways. However, Olivia doesn't see the evil creeping into Corrine's life. Will anyone escape this house of horrors with their sanity in check?<br/><br/>Based on Garden of Shadows and the third part of the series, this movie doesn't disappoint. Some characters add a new level of filth and deception to the saga. Nevertheless, Olivia is the worst because she goes from an abused woman to a willing accomplice. The costumes and social graces fit into the timeline perfectly, and the plot mentions 'The Crash' to hint at the film's era. This movie is one to gossip about with friends.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Keeping Up With the Joneses: The Wrong Marriage",
    "review":"Robin gets the family together to discuss the latest news: Webb is alive. Divorce is not an option because it will cause Jones's lucrative business dealings to come to a halt. However, a marriage can work both ways and open more doors for Robin and Webb. Instead of waiting for Webb to make the first move, Pam tells Robin to go after Webb.<br/><br/>Tara sits with Pam to discuss her conversation with the police about her teacher's death. Tara admits to Pam about the affair but is adamant she didn't kill him. However, Tara believes Eve is the killer because Tara asked Rick to seduce Eve for information. Pam refuses to believe her long-lost daughter could be a criminal, but Pam vows to help Tara.<br/><br/>Pam lets down her guard and meets Stephen to apologize. In the afterglow of a passionate night, Pam asks about Stephen's brother, Joey. He is a lieutenant at the police department.

However, the remedy will shock Kayla and bring her back full circle.<br/><br/>With all the Jones women on high alert professionally, their private lives intertwine with deception, blackmail, and betrayal. Anyone else would crack, but the Jones women come together to fight their enemies. But with a backstabber, a con-artist, and a kidnapper on their stylish heels, can the Jones women overcome?<br/><br/>In line with its previous movies, this one answers some questions while creating more. With all the drama, this episode focuses on family bonds. This show of family ties makes this film one of its most endearing displays of love. So, fasten your seatbelts darling. It's going to be a bumpy ride.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jennifer walks into the mental institution, and the nurses rave about Jennifer's book. Jennifer enters Tracy's room. Tracy is Jennifer's identical twin sister, and Jennifer offers Tracy some clothes and kind words before strolling to the door. Then, Tracy leaps off the bed, puts Jennifer in a headlock, and jabs a needle in Jennifer's neck. When Jennifer wakes up, she is lying in Tracy's bed and wearing Tracy's clothes. She tries to convince the staff she is not Tracy, but they don't believe her. Outside the hospital after decades, Tracy tries to navigate Jennifer's life. But Jennifer's work, obligations, and blackmail leave Tracy on a razor's edge. Tracy attempts to hide her secret from Jennifer's assistant, daughter, and fans, but she has no idea the secret Jennifer hides from her.<br/><br/>This film is an intense slow burn to a confusing but satisfying ending. For 95% of the movie, you will wonder what the lie is. However, you will need to DVR the film and play it back several times for a complete understanding. For those with extreme bloodlust, the body count is low. However, if you like a mystery with a Sherlock ending, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Fashion designer Lisa faces some challenges. Rumors say that retailers want to drop her clothing line, and her biography is on hold. Lisa sits with her publisher, Felicity, and discusses ways to move forward. Felicity says the book is flat and reads like an instructional book. They want to link Lisa with a biographer, Colin, to create a dynamic reading experience. Colin has an immersive approach and prefers to be at Lisa's side to get to know her better. For years, Felicity wanted Colin to finish his book. But after his wife passed, Colin put his novel aside and focused on his daughter, Kira. Felicity hopes working on Lisa's book will motivate Colin to finish his. Will the collaboration ignite a burning passion inside of them?<br/><br/>The film is straightforward and doesn't generate much interest. It tries to stir emotions with a father-daughter relationship, bonded by death, but it falls flat. It doesn't rely on humor but counts on fashion to drive the story. The fashion line is another flop. Like the film, the overall concept is well thought out but poorly executed. Save this on your film back burner.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In December, Peyton walks into her boss's office and asks for Mona's critique of her manuscript. Mona says it's good, but it's missing a personal angle to make readers connect.

It will give her manuscript the personal touch it needs. Peyton arrives but gets a shock when Thomas shows up with a plan. A plan to get her back.<br/><br/>Flashbacks save this movie. Throughout the film, you see flashbacks that spark relationships, friendships, and rivalries between the campers. Some issues are unresolved, like Peyton and Thomas. While Beckett misinterpreted his biggest camp issue, Janice and Dave have a new one. With everything going on, Peyton waits to hear about her new manuscript. Peyton envies her friends' lives because she feels they have it together. However, she learns they all have worries. This film is predictable, but it's funny.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
