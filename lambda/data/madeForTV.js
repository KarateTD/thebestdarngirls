    "mtitle": "A Carpenter Christmas Romance",
    "review": "Novelist Andrea Metcalf interviews for her latest novel before its release in January. The reporter heard a rumor that Andrea plans to kill off a prominent character. Andrea and her sister, manager Ella, panic in the car. A fan got a hold of an unpublished manuscript and put the pages online. Andrea arrives home to a swarm of reporters. She and Ella decide Andrea should leave. Ella wants Andrea to write a new ending, but Andrea declines.<br/><br/>Andrea settles into the cabin when she hears a noise in the kitchen. She calls out, and the man, Seth, screams. Andrea was Seth's tutor. They would make out during their tutoring session, but Seth would be mean to her in public. Andrea asks Seth why he's there. Her aunt, Rosie, lets him use her barn to create his artwork. Andrea agrees to let him keep working their while she hides and writes.<br/><br/>Andrea sits at her laptop and hears banging coming from the barn. She investigates and sees Seth with a crew and his father, William. Seth works as a carpenter on the property. The barn requires a lot of work after the fire. William explains that the fire wiped out half the town's homes, forestry, and businesses. Andrea spends time with Seth around town and uncovers how much he's changed. He impresses her until she unveils the secrets lurking beneath the surface. Can their budding relationship start when Seth repeats old mistakes?<br/><br/>This film is a steamy version of a Christmas movie, but it's not a classic. Andrea must accept that her life affects her writing. Seth must stop looking at the past. He thrives on being the hero, but every hero has a dark origin story. His is no different. While the movie is sexy, the plot is foreseeable. The film entertains with beautiful art.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Songwriter Brooke gets coffee for her team from her mother's bakery. Booke works at Mountain Lake Records. She is close to Chance, the owner, and the sound engineers, Laura and Devon. Brooke has worked on a Christmas song called Merry Go Round for weeks. She sings the songs and sells them to other artists. She's too nervous to sing in front of a large crowd, but Chance wants Brooke to sing the song at the Jamboree.<br/><br/>During a recording session, Rob enters Mountain Lake Records. He heard Brooke's song. He doesn't want just the song. Rob wants to offer Brooke a recording contract. Chance says she won't take it. Then, Rob offers to buy the song for $100,000 and 100% of the rights. Chance says no. Brooke walks into the room and wants to sell. Chance pulls her aside and explains his position. She agrees with Chance's decision. Rob accepts and asks for good places to eat. Brooke recommends a place and leaves with him.<br/><br/>Brooke discovers that Rob is staying in town for the Jamboree. Rob meets Brooke and offers to take her to a Parisian restaurant. He takes her to a tarmac to board his company's private jet to New York. At the studio, Chance asks Devon and Laura for Brooke's location. When Chance learns that Rob took her to New York, Chance stands shocked. He believes Rob will take Brooke from him and make her a star. Can he convince Brooke to stay?<br/><br/>While this movie appears sweet, Chance and Rob are manipulative and controlling. Rob is the sleazy guy from New York who promises Brooke the world. Chance lied to Brooke for years. He hid opportunities from her to keep her with his record label. Some viewers will want her to dump them both and start something new. However, this movie is a romance. So, it must end with love, understanding, and apologies. On the upside, the music is catchy, fun, and original. And Steve's a decent guy.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trading Up Christmas",
    "review": "Michelle's niece, Rosie, warns Michelle that her mother, Keri, has bad news. Keri preoccupies Rosie and tells Michelle she has terrible news. Her landlord wants to sell the building. This transition will be the 3rd time Keri and Rosie moved in 5 years. Keri worries that she's not providing Rosie stability. Michelle brainstorms about a way to help her sister and niece. She reads about a person who traded a paperclip for a house by trading up. Michelle believes she can do it with the internet behind her. Keri agrees but has some conditions. First, they can't tell Rosie. Second, Michelle must keep their names out of the post. Then she makes a heartfelt post about trading a homemade Christmas stocking for a house.<br/><br/>Dan's boss brings Dan the post about Michelle trading up. He wants Dan to contact the author and do a story about her motivation. Dan agrees to do the fluff piece and locates Michelle by offering to trade her stocking for a sweater.<br/><br/>Dan and Michelle meet, and he tells her about the article. He thinks the publicity can garner more and better trades. Michelle says no and demands the trade he promised. She leaves with his sweater and posts it on the site. After a few terrible offers, Michelle contacts Dan. She agrees to do the article. But her optimism clashes with his cynicism. Can Michelle trade her way to a home for Keri in 10 days while falling in love with Dan?<br/><br/>The plot feels wild, but people have traded up for a house. Although, 10 days is a deep stretch. Viewers should remember this is a Hallmark Christmas movie, so everything is possible. Michelle's attitude is to dream bigger. However, Keri focuses on reality. The script paints Dan as a Scrooge until viewers discover he is a man with a wounded heart. This movie is endearing but doesn't require your undivided attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nicole returns home and looks for her husband, Jim. Jim demands to know her whereabouts. He catches her in a lie before she tells the truth. Nicole took a pregnancy test, and the result was positive. She went to the hospital to confirm, and the positive was false. Lately, he's been distraught because he can't start his book. The publisher needs three chapters. Nicole is an editor. She asks Jim to allow her to read his pages. Nicole reads the manuscript, makes edits, and falls asleep. Later, Jim burns the pages when his boss likes Nicole's edits more than his writing.<br/><br/>Nicole confides to her work friends, Stuart and Kara, about Jim's behavior. Nicole wants Jim's adversarial attitude to change because she lied to him. She's pregnant. Kara has an idea. Kara went to Agnes for guidance. Agnes made Kara an elixir to fix her troubles. Kara believes Agnes can do the same for Nicole.<br/><br/>Nicole meets with Agnes and tells her about her desires. She wants Jim to be the man she married and love her again. She gives Nicole an elixir. Agnes instructs Nicole to put one drop in each of Jim's eyes. Nicole comes home and waits for Jim to fall asleep. She puts the elixir in his eyes and goes to bed. Nicole wakes to Jim cleaning and cooking. She believes her husband's back. Nicole has no idea about the danger in her life.<br/><br/>This movie feels lost in the weeds, but you must give it a chance. It leaves breadcrumbs about the plot without revealing the culprit's motive. When Nicole pieces everything together, the audience uncovers the clues they missed. The plot uses Lifetimers' knowledge against them. You believe you know the story's conclusion, but you're wrong. There is a more devious plan at play.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
