    "mtitle": "Girl in the Garage: The Laura Cowan Story",
    "review": "Laura Cowan gathered the courage to leave Cleveland and move to Los Angeles. After gaining a more lucrative position, Laura plans to find a new place to live. First, she will write everything down as a letter to God. Laura ventures around the area and stops to hear a man, Shabazz, preaching about helping the community. Laura starts dating Shabazz after meeting him and learning about his hopes and dreams. Four months later, he takes Laura to a storefront. Shabazz purchased it and wants to start a life with her. He proposes, and she says yes.<br/><br/>Laura and Shabazz have two children, Ahmed and Maryum, nine years later, and a successful bookstore. She continues to write letters to God, informing him about her life. Laura notices strange men hanging around the store, but Shabazz insists they are businessmen. A few days later, ATF arrests Shabazz for gun trafficking.<br/><br/>Laura loses the store and boxes books to return to the publishers. Then, Musa Muhammed enters the establishment. He is a friend of Shabazz's and speaks to Shabazz regularly. Musa promised Shabazz he would help Laura in any capacity. Musa offers to let Laura stay with him and his family until she figures things out. Laura believes this is a godsend. However, Musa is the devil in disguise. She and her children will suffer years of abuse and torture before they escape. Luckily, the pen is mightier than the sword.<br/><br/>This movie is a hard pill to swallow. Laura thought she could trust Musa because he practiced the same religion as her husband and was caring. Her relationship with Shabazz grew quickly, and he was loving towards her. She assumed Musa's friendship was the same. Laura doesn't see Musa for who he is until he turns on her children. Viewers must remember this story happened decades ago. Survivors didn't have an in-depth understanding of the different types of abuse. Laura outsmarted Musa by using the tools at her disposal. Her story is complex, but continue watching to see her shine and survive.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Lies We Bury",
    "review": "Rylee walks to her new job and bumps into Scott. Rylee meets her boss, Tucker, and he walks her to her office. It was an undeclared storage room for old case files. As Rylee goes through the files, she finds Stephanie's case. Rylee remembers her name because Stephanie was Rylee's mother's best friend in high school. Now, Stephanie is serving a life sentence for killing her co-worker Linda in 1996.<br/><br/>Rylee visits Stephanie in jail and goes over the case file. It reads that Stephanie shot Linda because Stephanie was jealous of the rumored raise Linda would receive. A witness, Barbara, planned to testify on Stephanie's behalf, but that ended when Stephanie confessed. Rylee believes someone else committed the crime and wants to prove Stephanie's innocence.<br/><br/>Rylee spends the evening with her mother, Patti. She asks Patti about Stephanie because they were friends years ago. Patti begs Rylee to leave the case alone. Rylee refuses to give up until she finds the person who killed Linda.<br/><br/>You must be 100% attentive while watching this film. It has several moving parts, including threats, tainted histories, and corruption. It briefly introduces characters, but everyone is integral to the story. Rylee has zero survival skills. She consistently puts herself in dangerous situations and amplifies the risk for others around her. Every scene has a purpose for this mystery, so you can't look away. This film entertains but can be confusing.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Bear Lake Murders",
    "review": "Detective Ally returns to work after catching serial killer Caden. She expects her captain to greet her with adulation. Instead, he gives her a forced leave of absence. He suggests Ally go to her family cabin in Bear Lake. Ally begrudgingly accepts. Then, Caden calls Ally from prison. He promises to see Ally soon. She goes to the Bear Lake diner, and a news report alarms her. Caden's prison transport was in an accident, and Caden escaped. Ally bumps into her old friend, Deputy Brody, and begs him not to tell anyone she's in town. Ally will remain vigilant in the cabin.<br/><br/>Rebecca teases her brother, Chief Roy, about running their father's department. She mentions she can't wait to leave their small town and travel the world like her favorite influencer, Sienna.<br/><br/>Sienna arrives in Bear Lake after winning a contest to stay at their hotel. She berates a server at the diner, and townsperson Miles condemns Sienna. Rebecca bumps into Sienna and spills her coffee on her shirt. Sienna tells Rebecca to stop because Rebecca could never do what she does. Then, Sienna walks to the park to make hiking content. Sienna breaks Rebecca's heart, and Brody comes to her rescue. They make plans to meet later, and Rebecca goes on a hike.<br/><br/>Roy views articles about old crimes at the lake. Brody tells him Ally's back in town, and Roy visits her. During their chat, Roy gets a call. They found a body in the park. The victim is Sienna. It seems like she fell, but they can't find her phone. Roy thinks it was an accident, but Ally fears she is another Caden kill. Can she find Caden before he kills again?<br/><br/>This movie feels lost for the first 40 minutes. However, the plot methodically introduces the characters, their backstories, and their motives. The storyline gives viewers a few red herrings, but Lifetimers will have their eye on the culprit after the first hour. The final reveal isn't unique, but it's funny. This film is an eventful ride with a relaxed ending.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Polar Opposites",
    "review": "Court Illustrator Emma anxiously waits for her date while her best friend watches from the bar. Emma can't believe her date stood her up. Her friend joins Emma at the table, but the conversation ends abruptly when her father, Ian, calls. The call is spotty, but Emma hears the word danger and panics. Ian does research in Antarctica. He often goes alone to watch his favorite penguin colony. She knows getting to Antarctica won't be easy, but she books a flight to catch a ship.<br/><br/>Emma arrives at the port for the SH Vega and approaches Captain Ingrid. Emma explains her situation, but Ingrid informs her that she can't go to Antarctica without a cruise ticket, a research crew, or the proper paperwork. Emma slinks away and sees a research crew grabbing their stuff to board. She seizes one of their cases and blends in with them. Mechanical engineer Andy spots her. Emma uses jargon she overheard to distract Andy. She boards the ship and hides in a closet. Emma doesn't know how she will keep her presence a secret for 10 days.<br/><br/>Emma sneaks upstairs to get food. She tries to leave with her plate but runs into Andy. He gives her an assignment, and Emma tries to do it. She makes an excuse to run out of the room. Andy follows. Emma tells Andy the truth, and his dread grows. He contemplates telling Ingrid but has compassion for Emma's plight. He allows Emma to stay in his room, but she can't leave. Emma will lay low until they dock. Then, she will find Ian to ensure he's safe. But will she uncover more?<br/><br/>This movie is worthwhile for the view alone. The coastline, penguins, and sky are breathtaking. Hallmarkies can rest assured that Emma's time on the boat is one-half of the plot. The other half is her time in Antarctica. Ian, Emma, and Andy work together to help someone in need while Emma re-evaluates her view on relationships. They combine their skills to save a family and uncover Emma's calling. This movie is sweet, genuine, and funny.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Terror Comes Knocking: The Marcela Borges Story",
    "review": "Marcela and Ruben Borges watch their baby's heartbeat during their prenatal exam. After the appointment, Ruben and Marcela head toward their separate cars. Marcela will go to their son's graduation while Ruben works. Ruben promises to pick up the cake before heading home for Ryan's party.<br/><br/>Marcela and Ruben consider going to the zoo before getting a knock at the door. Ryan runs to the door and opens it. Three masked men - Victor, Miguel, and Oscar - enter with guns. They tie up the Borgeses and ransack the house. They demand Ruben's money. They put the family in their SUV and drive to another location.<br/><br/>The kidnappers bring the Borgeses to a trailer park and throw them onto the floor. Marcela begs for her family's life. Then, a masked woman, Bianca, speaks. She wants $200,000, or she will kill the Borgeses one at a time. Bianca knows everything about them and won't allow Marcela to say otherwise. She won't let Marcela's pleas, tears, or tricks distract her. Can the Borgeses survive?<br/><br/>It's unbelievable that anyone could survive this situation. The script puts the audience in a sense of panic. It allows you to see the unspoken communication between Marcela and Ruben. The Borgeses do everything to survive this nightmare. The conclusion gives the viewers each character's recap. However, the motive is missing from the script. A member of Bianca's family needs $100,000 to avoid jail time. Bianca had insight into Ruben's business finances and assumed Ruben's wealth. You will cheer for Marcela's daring decision but cringe at the recap. It lets viewers know that the world is unfair.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
