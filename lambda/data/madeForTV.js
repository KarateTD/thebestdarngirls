    "mtitle":"Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Heist and Seek",
    "review":"The town is abuzz with the library's upcoming Renaissance Night fundraiser for the new reading room.  The biggest draw is seeing Lester's Gift.  It is a headdress gifted to Queen Elizabeth by Lester who was head over heels in love with her.  Chief Lynn and Detective Arthur have set up CCTV cameras and go over procedures with security.  Before the headdress is displayed, Kelly Stevens, Detective Arthur, and Chief Lynn watch the security guard, Talbot, fix the headdress on the mannequin and close the curtain. When the curtain opens, the headdress is gone.  Aurora knows the thief must be in the room.  Her choices are Kelly, James, Eric, Howard, and Miya.  Kelly worked for the museum that lent the headdress for the fundraiser. James is on the museum board.  He believes art should be enjoyed and moved so others can see it. Eric, Aurora's latest attempt to set Sally up, is a Western Civilization professor and Nick's friend.  When he continues to lie by omission, Eric is on the list. Howard stepped onto the stage right before the headdress was revealed.  When his felonious past is unearthed, he is added to the suspect's list.  Miya is in the import/export business.   Before anyone left the library's fundraiser, everyone was searched.  But Miya refused. As Aurora mentally prepares the list, she sees another suspect leaving.  The security guard Talbot.  She follows him to his hotel and finds him dead from a gunshot wound and no headdress.  This confirms Talbot was the thief but he had a partner.  Can she find the mastermind behind the plan?<br/><br/>Based on the Aurora Teagarden novels, you get a strong mystery that will have you guessing from start to finish.  Every one is shifty and keeps their secrets close.  With each secret, Aurora adds and removes names from her list.  Much to detriment of her relationships.  She keeps her eyes so close on the case, she is missing the bigger picture.  Nick is ready to ask for her and in marriage. Aurora fans will be getting their long-awaited proposal.  The well-written mystery is a stupendous bonus.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Twisted Twin",
    "review":"Before Tess's college freshman orientation, she notices someone is following her.  She hides in the bathroom.  Once she hears the footsteps leave, she exits the stall.  A figure in a hoodie jumps up and tells her not to scream. Sammy, Tess's twin, introduces herself.  Years ago, Mitch and Kim adopted Sammy because they only wanted one child.  Days later, Patricia adopted Tess.  However, Patricia was never told Tess was a twin. Sammy invites Tess to stay the night at her parents' mansion.  Tess wakes to her clothes missing and a note from Sammy.  Sammy decided to switch places to help Tess with her Spanish exam.  She tells Tess to enjoy the switch and be the best Sammy she can be.  Damon sees Tess and starts to kiss her, assuming she is Sammy.  Then he sees the housekeepers approaching.  He tells Tess to get rid of them.  She tries but she just can't keep them out.  Soon, one of the housekeepers makes a blood-curdling scream.  They found Sammy's parents dead inside the home.  Tess can't believe it.  The police come to investigate.  Tess tries to explain that she is not Sammy.   However, they can't find the note Sammy left her. When Patricia and Sammy, posing as Tess, denied they knew about the twin, Tess knows her mom is in danger.  Tess will do anything to save her mom and Sammy will do anything to stay out of jail.  Who will prevail?<br/><br/>While the ending is a bit sappy, kudos for having intelligent cops in a Lifetime movie.  These cops don't take things at face value and work their investigation.  Lorynn York did a great job of making Sammy and Tess different.  She changed her voice pattern, her walk, and her glare to keep the characters divergent.  Special effects and a body double allowed their interactions to be coherent. And the gun standoff was everything you didn't know you wanted.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
