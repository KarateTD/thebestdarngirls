    "review": "Jo warns her friend, co-worker Alicia, that Alicia's check will be late. The system couldn't match her social security number to Alicia's new name. Alicia understands with a smile and leaves for the evening.<br/><br/>Alicia arrives at her son's school, but he isn't there. She calls her sister, Kam, in a panic. Later, Alicia finds Malcolm with his friends in an abandoned lot. Malcolm admits he turned his phone off to avoid her calls. She yells at her son but buys him sneakers to apologize. Malcolm looks inside the shoes and finds an AirTag. He refuses to wear them.<br/><br/>Across town, Victor pays a visit to his friend, Stevie. Stevie can't believe Victor is out of jail after doing eight years of a 15-year stint. Victor reminds Stevie that he didn't snitch on their crime. Now, Victor wants his cut. Stevie tells Victor he doesn't have it. After damaging Stevie's client's property, Victor leaves with Stevie's wife's diamond bracelet and Stevie's car.<br/><br/>Victor stalks Kam and steals her phone. He uses her phone to locate Malcolm. Victor approaches his son at a basketball court, but Malcolm doesn't recognize him. He pulls out an old family photo to prove he is Malcolm's father. Malcolm welcomes Victor with open arms and brings him home.<br/><br/>Alicia walks through the door and asks whose car is in the driveway. She goes to Malcolm's doorway and stands in horror, seeing Victor playing video games with Malcolm. Victor smiles and hands Alicia a diamond bracelet. He promises he is a changed man and invites Alicia and Malcolm to dinner so she can see the new Victor. Alicia runs to her room and calls Kam. Kam reminds Alicia that Victor broke her nose and bruised her ribs in the past. Alicia says she will go out with Victor to appease him, but nothing more.<br/><br/>Alicia, Victor, and Malcolm eat dinner and return. Alicia turns down a kiss but allows Victor to hug her. Victor asks for a second date, but Alicia dodges the questions. After he leaves, Alicia runs inside and tells Malcolm to pack. She walks her bag to the car, and Victor is there. He forces Alicia into the car, goes inside, and tells Malcolm they will return soon. He sees a crate by the trash bin and gets a horrendous idea. He will bury her alive and take Malcolm. Alicia doesn't know that being buried alive is the first disgusting thing Victor will put her through in 24 hours.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie will strike fear in your heart. Alicia met Victor at a young age and suffered through domestic violence. Alicia and Victor are between the reconciliation and calm stage in the cycle of abuse. Lifetime viewers must restrain their frustration towards Malcolm. Alicia never explained their past. Alicia believes she can control Victor's anger until the dinner. She gets a flash of the old Victor and wants to run. While it's easy to point out mistakes, viewers mustn't forget Alicia's fear, hope, and strength.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Shae and Chris arrive in Shae's hometown to look at the tourist traps. Before their tour, Shae takes Chris to meet retired ranger Larry. Larry was friends with Shae's father, Jim, before Jim died. She tells Larry she wants to sell Jim's house, and Larry blames Chris. Shae and Chris look around Shae's old bedroom, and he finds her childhood diary. He finds a picture of her former high school boyfriend, Burke. They arrive at a parking lot, park their car, and grab their gear. Then, Ranger Burke sees them and approaches. Shae dislikes the direction of the conversation and ends it. She leaves and hikes with Chris.<br/><br/>Burke follows Chris and Shae as they walk through the park and sees another woman following them. He deduces they are heading towards a bench and checks out the area. Burke spots a ring box. Burke grabs the ring box from the bench.<br/><br/>Chris arrives at the bench but can't find the ring. He tells Shae to wait and sprints away. Chris uncovers the woman, Rachel, and asks about the ring's location. Rachel is Chris's photography student, and he hired her to take candid proposal images. Rachel tells him that she put it on the bench. But she saw a ranger in the area, and he may have it. Chris demands Burke return the ring, but Burke denies having it. Rachel says she has pictures as proof, and Burke lunges for her camera. They fight, and Burke pushes Chris off a bluff. Rachel runs away. Burke chases after and shoots her. Then, he puts the ring on Rachel's finger and takes her phone. Burke finds Shae looking for Chris and tries to deter her. But it doesn't work. Shae is determined to find the man she loves, even if it kills her. Or Burke does.<br/><br/>Every guy in this movie is disgusting. Chris is insecure about images in Shae's diary from the 6th grade. Larry thinks he has a say in how Shae lives her life. And Burke is a bully and creep. Shae and Rachel should run from all of them. The shining light in the movie is Shae's determination. Locals Tiffany and Finn seem out of place but make a necessary appearance later. This film is 30 minutes shorter than the others, but that time would've been a waste. This picture grabs your attention, but the men are cringy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Heiress and the Handyman",
    "review": "June is relaxing at her Greek vacation home when a staff member brings her a bright red phone. It's her business manager, Michael. Sadly, the crypto market crashed, and now June has nothing. June meets her assistant, Tyler, at the airport. He tells June that they froze her money and took over her possessions. Then he remembers her aunt Birdie left June a necklace with a safe deposit key.<br/><br/>June goes to the bank after failing several jobs and sleeping in her car. She opens Birdie's safe deposit box and finds a deed for a home in Greenville. She promptly drives to the house, walks inside, and sees a pig. A man, Bart, asks why June is there, and June jumps. She assumes he is a staff member and rattles off a list of demands. Bart exits after telling June he isn't the handyman, and she can't hide her embarrassment.<br/><br/>Bart and his sister, Nina, feel sad for the unfortunate socialite because her parents died when she was a girl. So, a staff raised June. Bart decides to help June acclimate to the land and teach her how to care for it and the animals. After a hard day's work, Bart takes June to the local store, and they run into Birdie's rival, Dotty. Dotty's words get under June's skin, and June unknowingly accepts Dotty's Harvest Festival challenge. Bart promises to be by her side and guide June through the process. June and Bart spark a romance, but will it last when the past comes knocking for June?<br/><br/>June feels guilty for not spending time with Birdie but connects with her during the competition. This reconnection is charming. However, the movie falls flat. First, the title doesn't make sense. Second, the ending feels false. June shouldn't have to choose between the two worlds. And, Nina's final gift is a beautiful gesture.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "A doctor checks on their amnesia patient, but the patient doesn't remember her name. Luckily, the doctor identified the woman as Mia, a famous romance author. A man enters the room and introduces himself as Mia's husband, Jessie. They have a daughter, Madison, in community college, and he was in the car crash with her but wasn't hurt. Madison and Jessie take Mia home. Mia remembered a woman in the passenger seat. She asks if they have another daughter. Jessie says her nightmare isn't a memory because he was the only person in the car with her.<br/><br/>Madison drives Mia to her physical therapy appointment, and Mia meets her physical therapist, Erin. The two get to know each other during their sessions. Then, Mia remembers sharing a cupcake with the woman in the car. Mia converses with Erin about the flashback as a fan named Wade approaches and asks for an autograph. He confesses that he has all of Mia's books and articles written about her. Mia asks for a copy and gives Wade her address so he can deliver it.<br/><br/>Mia returns home. She sees Jessie's new iPad and Madison's new coat. Jessie tells Mia that Mia got a 6 figure advance. Mia is uncomfortable spending the money. Jessie assures her it will all be okay. Mia asks about another daughter, but Jessie says they are a family of three.<br/><br/>Mia goes to therapy again, and Erin wonders if Wade turned in the information. Mia says no and wants to find him. Mia and Erin go to Wade's house, and an officer answers the door. Sadly, the officer tells Mia that Wade is dead.<br/><br/>Mia finds her book on the shelf and opens it. The dedication page says, 'For Angela.' Then, a man follows her into the bathroom, and Erin scares him off. She thinks Jessie is hiding something from her. The scary thing is that he's telling the truth. Well, at least a half-truth.<br/><br/>First, let's give a R.I.P. to Wade. Once he died, the script forgot about him. Second, fellow Lifetimers should be ready to scream 'the audacity' each time Jessie opens his mouth. He dismisses Mia's feelings and is very condescending. Also, Mia makes annoying mistakes that will make your blood boil. The movie has funny moments, but viewers watch to see if their hunch is correct.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Birdie and Alden take private investigator classes to fine-tune their skills. However, Birdie is worried they are becoming the Murder Couple. She wants more couple friends outside of their life of investigation.<br/><br/>Alden meets with Birdie in the parking lot after interrupting her yoga class. He tempts her into eating a donut when her old high school rival, Kristin, approaches. She invites them to her home to eat and meet her new boyfriend, Tom.<br/><br/>Birdie and Alden arrive at Kristin's home. Birdie sips wine in the kitchen with Kristin while Alden looks at Kristin's bookshelf. He finds a book from his favorite 'true crime' author, Laurel St. James. Kristin is a true crime buff, and they jump for joy. Then, Tom knocks. To their surprise, Tom is Detective Tom Newton. They sigh.<br/><br/>Across town, Laurel enters Studio 45 to record her podcast. She briefly converses with the manager, Nigel, before knocking on the window to get another podcaster's attention. She shows Pat it's 9:02 pm and forces him to leave. Laurel records her segment about a local serial killer. She says she is ready to reveal the truth. Someone walks into the studio, shoots Laurel, and leaves a note on her body.<br/><br/>Birdie and Alden hear about Laurel's murder on the news. They report that Laurel could be a victim of the serial killer. At the police station, Detective Newton investigates the podcasters and Nigel. However, Newton can't comprehend what these characters are saying. Tom's boss wants to hire someone that speaks their language. Newton grinds his teeth and calls Birdie and Alden. The Cases are on the case. Can they find Laurel's killer?<br/><br/>This mystery series is different because Alden and Birdie are a happily married couple. So, they deal with real-life issues about maintaining their marriage. Since each movie doesn't have a 'falling in love' subplot, the writers can focus on the crime. And this one is a doozy. Birdie and Alden hilariously work together to find Laurel's enemies. They do this while tracking a mouse in their home. Alden's final trap is legendary. The conclusion will throw sleuthers for a loop and bring a tear to your eye as the Cases bring closure to a town. Don't miss this second installment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
