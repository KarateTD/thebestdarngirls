Now they have to work together to compete for the same job.  Too bad love is standing in the way.<br/><br/>With nods to Balsam Hills, an umbrella, and Charlie Brown, this movie will have you laughing.  Terrie and David have a low blow battle of the sexes while keeping it professional.  When Terrie feels in control, her boyfriend, Noah, causes her to have dead air for 10 seconds.  Noah breaks a cardinal relationship rule.  As Terrie and David’s romance is building, a new job, Noah, and the network stand in love’s way.  While the storyline is predictable; however, Terrie and David’s banter makes the movie watchable.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amy celebrates passing the bar with friends and classmates, Owen and Letty.  When Owen’s trainer, Demetri, buys them a round of shots, Amy doesn’t drink it. They share a cab to head home.  Demetri lets Amy out of the cab but asks to come in for a nightcap.  She tells him no and goes home.  Later that night, she hears a knock at her door and assumes it’s her neighbor Chickie.  She opens the door and sees Demetri.  He beats and rapes her.  Since she knows her attacker, the police decide a rape kit isn’t necessary.  Amy is dumbfounded by their inability to help her.  Then, Demetri threatens her in a public parking lot in broad daylight.  After her restraining order, Amy discovers she’s pregnant.  She believes in a woman’s right to choose and she chooses to have her child.  When the cops finally question Demetri, they let it slip that Amy is pregnant.  Demetri ignores the restraining order and comes to Amy’s home with a gun.  He threatens to kill her and the unborn baby if she doesn’t drop the rape charge.  Amy decides she can’t wait for the police to protect her and her baby and moves to Georgia to start a new life.   Years later, Amy is the proud and over-protective mother of Maddy.  She is served with custody papers.  Demetri wants custody and visitation of Maddy.  Since the rape charge happened in another state, it can’t be brought up in the custody case.  Amy’s fight will launch a change for all rape survivors and their children.<br/><br/>Be ready to scream and throw things at the screen after hearing every horrific statistic and every hurdle Amy has to jump over to keep her child safe.
