    "mtitle":"How She Caught a Killer",
    "review":"David walks to Linda after she graduates from the police academy. Linda joins David's precinct but becomes increasingly disinterested in the mundane cases. Linda stands outside David's office and eavesdrops on David's conversation with FBI Agent Neil. David wrote several letters to the FBI for assistance, and the FBI sent their rookie agent to tell David to stop. During their conversation, an officer reports another murder with the same signature. Now, they have enough victims to flag it as a serial killer.<br/><br/>Neil and David discuss the next steps for catching the killer, and Neil suggests putting someone undercover. David says his men don't have the training, but Linda enters the room. She reminds David that she looks like all the victims and that the office underutilizes her. Before David can reject Linda again, Neil agrees with her. Then, David lays down the ground rules. First, Linda can't go anywhere without her gun because the killer uses a hammer to murder his victims. Linda has to wear a wire. Finally, Linda can't get into anyone's vehicle. Linda promises to adhere to the rules and eagerly goes undercover. Can Linda catch the killer without losing herself?<br/><br/>This movie, set in the 1980s, relies heavily on police work because DNA testing was in its infancy. Sadly, the film reminds viewers that the ideas about prostitutes and their profession haven't changed. Also, Linda makes blaring mistakes. But remember, she is a rookie. This film emphasizes the taboo of sex work, the dark mind, and the advancement of DNA testing.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Carol offers to look after Alice for Paul, and he agrees.<br/><br/>The girls become inseparable and spend time together in Paul's outdoor store. While prepping boxes, Alice has a hard time breathing.

Lucy privately admits to Alice that she doesn't want to move again. Alice and Lucy decide to 'Parent Trap' Paul and Emma so they will fall in love and plant roots. Will their plan work?<br/><br/>This movie is fast-paced, heart-warming, funny, and thrilling. Paul and Emma are honest with others about their feelings but take their time talking to each other. They don't wait for the last 30 seconds to kiss. Seeing Alice and Lucy secretly plan the date is highly entertaining. The flying scenes are flawless. But if you suffer from motion sickness, you may have to look away. This story is endearing and one of the best-written stories of the Fall into Love series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
