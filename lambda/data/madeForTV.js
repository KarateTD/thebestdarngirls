    "mtitle":"Vanished in Yosemite",
    "review":"Jennifer and her sister, Katrina, go kayaking in Yosemite National Park. Katrina wants to go off-script and have fun. But, for Jennifer, a plan is fun. Katrina relents to Jennifer's itinerary, and they go to dinner. They converse when Katrina sees a handsome man, Rick, sitting at the table beside them. Rick is a photographer working for a conservation group. He offers to take them around the park, but Jennifer turns him down for herself and her sister. However, Katrina gets his number.<br/><br/>Plans derail in the morning because Jennifer gets food poisoning from dinner. Katrina puts Jennifer in bed for the day and hikes with Rick. Katrina and Rick stop to use a public bathroom, but Rick suggests Katrina leave her backpack behind. He takes the opportunity to spike her water and encourages Katrina to drink it when she returns. Rick grabs Katrina, carries her to his pickup truck, and drives away. Katrina wakes up tied to a bed in a cabin as Rick plans with his friend to kill her.<br/><br/>Jennifer feels better but worries about Katrina. It's been hours since Katrina texted, so she calls Rick. Rick doesn't pick up, and Jennifer's tension grows. Jennifer takes a deep breath and calls her ex-boyfriend, Wally, for help. Wally quickly turns Jennifer down but regrets it and calls her back. He agrees to travel to Yosemite and help Jennifer find Katrina. Can they save Katrina, or will they become victims too?<br/><br/>Jennifer is supposed to be the heroine but is entitled, unhelpful, and ungrateful. Most of Wally's hunches and suggestions are correct and lead her in the right direction. Katrina doesn't sit around waiting for someone to rescue her. She tries to fight back, get under Rick's skin, and attract attention. The movie's saving grace is the last 3 minutes. Jennifer and Katrina band together to take Rick down. You will laugh. Save this on your DVR when you must kill 2 hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Hiding from My Husband",
    "review":"Jessica looks at her black eye and decides to leave her husband, Peter. Jessica puts a stash of cash and passports for herself and her son, Noah, in her purse. She calls her sister, Rachel, for a ride. Rachel asks if she can come later, but Jessica knows now is the only time. She looks out the window and panics when she sees Peter walking to the front door. Jessica runs out the back and flags down her Uber driver. Jessica goes to Noah's school and forcefully pulls him out of class. They jump in the car and travel to Rachel's house on a remote island city.<br/><br/>Jessica and Noah settle in with Rachel. Rachel promises this will be a fresh start but warns Jessica that Peter incessantly calls. Jessica gets Noah's phone and walks to the beach. She checks the slew of voicemails Peter left. They range from loving to sympathetic to mean to threatening. Jessica is on high alert with friends, family, and strangers. After Peter dies, Jessica can't shake the feeling that Peter is still a threat. Is she right?<br/><br/>This movie is Enough mixed with The Invisible Man without giving viewers a deep sense of fear. The writers foreshadow the twist, but viewers won't invest in the plot enough to care. Jessica displays the PTSD survivors often deal with after leaving their abuser. Also, Noah isn't a brat. He understands why they left and shows the proper response to sudden life changes. The twist feels forced and fast but adds something new to the obvious conclusion. If you can get past the poor wardrobe choices, this is watchable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Lucy meets Antoine at the docks. He is the son of her host family. Antoine's mother, Madeleine, greets Lucy with open arms and playfully scorns Antoine for not carrying Lucy's bags. Lucy meets Antoine's father, Judge Remy, but he maintains some distance.<br/><br/>Lucy and Antoine meet outside school on Friday, and she plans to study. Antoine convinces her to have some fun on the weekend and go to a party. Antoine can't conceal his jealousy when Lucy swoons over DJ Vincent. Before Lucy can meet the DJ, Antoine sees Vincent's parole officer enter the club. Antoine grabs Lucy, and they stay in the closet all night and kiss.<br/><br/>Antoine drops Lucy off at his parents' house but leaves for his loft. Lucy walks up the driveway and sees a man arguing with Remy. Remy gets a knife and stabs him. Remy tells Lucy he was protecting himself, but self-defense is harder to prove to Paris police. He asks Lucy to open the back door, and he will hide the body. Lucy complies.<br/><br/>Lucy comes home after school to find Lt. Laurent in Remi and Madeleine's living room. Laurent informs Lucy that a man, Gaston, is dead, and Lucy's DNA is on his body. Laurent arrests Lucy and takes her to the station. Lucy realizes there is no way the French government has her DNA on file, and they can't make a match that fast. Remy is setting her up, and Laurent is helping him. With quick thinking, she is on the run with Antoine. They must clear Lucy's name before she loses her freedom, or worse, her life. This movie drags in the beginning, but the wait sets up the false narrative Lucy sees about her host family. As Lucy penetrates the façade, she sees Remy's controlling nature. Lucy isn't a damsel in distress waiting for someone to save her. She uses low-tech solutions, quick footwork, and intelligence to stay one step ahead. The journey is worth it, if you survive the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

If she loses, her boss, Joyce, could fire her. Cassandra's friends remind her that they can take a long-awaited trip to Napa Valley to see where Cassandra spent her childhood if she gets fired. However, Cassandra wants to stay the course. And she avoids Napa because of family tension. Then, Cassandra gets a call informing her that her grandmother, Emma, died.<br/><br/>Cassandra goes to work, and her assistant, Hank, tells Cassandra that Joyce wants to see her immediately. She squares her shoulders and prepares to get fired, but Joyce promotes Cassandra to partner because she won. Cassandra accepts the job but asks for two days off to attend Emma's funeral.<br/><br/>Cassandra sits at her desk when a lawyer calls about Emma's vineyard. Emma left everything to Cassandra. Cassandra plans to settle her grandmother's estate and sell the vineyard after the funeral.<br/><br/>Cassandra travels to the vineyard and finds Emma's best friend, Isabel, in the home. After the funeral, Isabel hands Cassandra letters from Emma. Emma reconciled with Cassandra's daughter and wanted Cassandra to keep the land in the family. Cassandra decides to take a 6-month sabbatical from work to run the vineyard.<br/><br/>Isabel greets Cassandra at Emma's home and introduces Cassandra to the vineyard manager, Alec. As Emma aged, he helped Emma run the vineyard and manage the crew. Cassandra asks Alec to give her a crash course about running a vineyard, and Alec and Isabel laugh.<br/><br/>Seeing the vineyard needs a lot of work, Cassandra goes to the bank to obtain a loan. The bank manager tells Cassandra the land is underwater because Emma mortgaged it to the hilt. Then Alec gives Cassandra more unfortunate news. The vineyard only bottles the vintage wines. They don't make wine or host events anymore. Cassandra needs to turn it all around or sell her family's legacy. It's time for Cassandra to roll up her sleeves, ask for help, and find love.<br/><br/>This film is what you expect. A big-city attorney goes to a vineyard and finds peace in open spaces with a handsome widower and single father. The ending isn't a surprise. The movie separates itself because Cassandra learns about her mother and Emma reuniting through letters. Cassandra also uncovers why her mother left the vineyard and how her parents felt about it. One final yell puts everything into perspective and helps Cassandra guide her decisions. Those moments make this film worth watching.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
