    "review":"Veteran Chloe Marquee counsels soldiers who need help transitioning into civilian life. The holidays are Chloe's busiest time of the year.  Her mother, Lynn, and boss, Colonel Cole, believe Chloe spreads herself too thin. But Colonel Cole wants Chloe to focus on her actual job.  She promises to give her job 100%, but she refuses to reduce her volunteer work.  When she meets with General O'Toole about surprising her young neighbor, Savannah, with having her parents come home for the holidays, he adds a new duty to her volunteer list.  He wants Chloe to run and fundraise a toy drive. Chloe smiles and takes on the new job.  Then she sees a picture of a veteran with a group of children.  This veteran is a man she counsels named Michael Fisher. At first, he didn't think he needed help to transition into civilian life, but later, he changed his mind. Overseas, he ran a toy drive for the local children.  She tells Michael she has a purpose for him, running their toy drive.  He agrees, and they decide to run the toy drive like a combat op. While Chloe tries to deny it, Lynn can see the love between Chloe and Michael.  But Chloe won't pursue it because the love of his life is still deployed, but she is not who Chloe thinks she is.<br/><br/>Typically, the movie is about a soldier coming home, falling in love, and deploying again.  This time, the movie is about two vets healing each other while helping the community.  This film touches on hardships veterans face while transitioning into civilian life. The film allows you to predict who he loves with a single longing glance.  With a sprinkle of Christmas magic, three soldiers will be returning home to people who love them.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Caroline works for the World Vista blog, and they placed third for the international travel award.  Her boss, Camilla, is happy for the team and gives the next group of travel assignments for Christmas, but she tells Caroline to stay after the meeting.  Camilla noticed Caroline's writings lost their passion. Camilla wants Caroline to find her joy for writing and her love for Christmas.  Camilla assigns Caroline to go to Carte de Amor.  Caroline assumes it's in South America or Spain; however, it's a New Mexico B and B in Camilla's hometown.  She hopes the town's Christmas spirit will rub off on her and inject itself into her writing.  After a countryside train ride, Caroline meets Oscar, Camilla's cousin. Caroline loves the decorations but hates the accommodations.  The B and B doesn't have cell service, WiFi, nor TVs.  However, it does have Oscar and his son to show her around the town.<br/><br/>You can skip this movie.  Caroline is condescending and rude to the local town in her first post. The town expresses their hurt over her first article and lets their feelings known.  However, they don't turn their back on her. Instead, they welcome her and invite her to join in the festivities.  You and the town deserve better.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jen is a talented game designer who refuses to stand up for her work or contributions.  She baked cookies for her boss, Tony, to thank him for recommending her for the promotion.  Stunned, Jen learns Tony left abruptly after finding a new job.  A co-worker tells her to talk to Tony's boss, Alastair, and recommend herself for the Head Game Creator position. Then, Alastair sees her on the stairs and calls her into a meeting with Wanda.  Wanda owns and runs a local hotel chain, and she wants a game to drum up new business before the soft opening. Aiden pitches a scavenger hunt, but Wanda is unimpressed.  Under her breath, Jen comments that the scavenger hunt should lead to lesser-known holiday-themed places in Chicago.  And the hotel's soft opening can be the last clue.  Wanda loves the idea.  Jen and Aiden take the assignment.  While Jen is ready to collaborate, Aiden wants to work alone and reconvene later.  Aiden wants to make a good impression because he wants the Head Game Creator job.  He can use the raise to fix his dad's old home before his dad comes back from an overseas hospital. They will have to come together to create the game's clues.  When they realize they are eyeing the same promotion, will love or the job come first?<br/><br/>With Vanilla Meltaways, Buche de Noël, Pear Cider, and Eggnog Cocktail, this movie will give you plenty of new food ideas for the season. Two people and one job, you would think someone would have to lose.  If that's your thought, it proves you weren't paying attention.  The foreshadowing in this movie is very subtle. This film is a fun movie for the holidays, not a favorite, but fun.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
