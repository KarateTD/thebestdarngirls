    "review":"Sam leaves her home after thugs come looking for her to get their money. She walks the streets calling family for help when a man tells Sam to get off his car. In an attempt to flirt, the man reveals that Trip will sell stolen diamonds at a party. Audra creates NFTs for a local gallery and cares for her grandmother, G.G., with cancer. Audra freezes in place at the sight of Sam at the gallery. Sam admits she needs money. Audra agrees to listen and call their friends Zoe and Lauryn. Zoe resides with her famous rapper boyfriend, Smoke. She is happy to let him take care of her because she wants to get pregnant and build a life with Smoke. Influencer Lauryn got a brand deal to be the face of an international makeup brand. Zoe, Lauryn, and Audra listen to Sam's plan to rob Trip and sell the diamonds. They immediately say no because they have too much to lose.<br/><br/>Lauryn gets on Instagram to promote her new brand deal. Her niece notices the company tests its product on animals. Lauryn says it's no big deal and killing bunnies is helping the population because they breed too much. Soon, fans create a hashtag canceling Lauryn and calling her a bunny killer. Audra goes to the gallery to find an FBI notice on the door and a chain lock preventing access to the building. And without the job, she doesn't have insurance to cover G.G.'s chemo. Zoe takes a pregnancy test amid Audra's panic, and it's positive. Zoe waits until 4 a.m. for Smoke to come home. She questions his whereabouts and discovers he is cheating. She leaves without telling Smoke she's pregnant with his child.<br/><br/>Zoe, Audra, and Lauryn meet with Sam again. They like her plan but see issues with it. If they steal Trip's jewels and sell them, he could find and kill them. They will make copies of them and replace them with Trip's authentic diamonds. Trip won't know they are fake and never come after them. And they can sell them and split the money four ways. Seems easy enough, right?<br/><br/>This movie starts like Set It Off with four friends falling on hard times. They use a get-rich-quick scheme to get the money they need to start over. Schemers within and outside the group start making independent plans to look out for number one. Then the film mixes Den of Thieves and Ocean's Eight. Viewers never know who's in control, the master plan, or the outcome. And it ends with the possibility of part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Austin splits time between Wolf Creek and Jason's ranch. Jason informs Austin that Jason needs a full-time ranch hand. He wants Austin to take the job, but Jason puts an ad in the paper. Jason will give Austin until Christmas Eve at 5 pm to accept the job. Austin tells Sam, and she is not happy. She thinks Austin is using the job to pull away from their relationship.<br/><br/>Terry tells his father, Felix, that Felix should charge more for Christmas Town. If not, the festival won't be back next year. Terry tells Sam to charge for the play and the reindeer. Sam tells Terry that the play and petting zoo is at no cost for everyone. It entices them to come to the Wolf Creek Rescue booth and adopt a dog. Terry says no, demands she charges, and leaves.<br/><br/>Annie wishes her father could skip work and enjoy the Christmas Town Festival. Her grandfather, George, tells Annie not to worry because her dad loves working and caring for her. As Sam and her sister, Sunny, discuss the play with George, Annie walks outside. She sees the reindeer, Cupid, and asks the animal if it's one of Santa's magical reindeer. Annie asks Cupid to find her dad in New York and bring him back to Christmas town. She opens the enclosure, lets Cupid out, and follows him into the woods. As George runs outside for Annie, he notices Annie is gone. He catches a glimpse of her walking to the woods and follows. Sam, Austin, Sunny, and Terry go outside and discover Cupid is missing. Terry threatens that if Sam doesn't bring back Cupid, he will cancel her play. Sam gets a static-filled call from George. He found Annie, but Cupid escaped when he tried to catch him. Now, Annie and George are lost and don't know where to go. Sam and Austin jump on a snowmobile to find Annie, George, and Cupid while Sunny fearfully works on the play.<br/><br/>This sequel isn't as exciting as the first but provides an animal chase through the woods. Fans of the series get new and returning characters for this Christmas special. The movie stretches the truth with Annie. It's not easy to comprehend a kid her age would believe in magical reindeer and Santa. The movie is an average conclusion to Up TV's Merry Movie Christmas, but the real snow and reindeer chase help.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara works at a local station as a meteorologist. She is the most accurate but only number two in the ratings. Sam, at another station, is number one. Tara's assistant, Mia, found a viral video of a national meteorologist flipping out and quitting on air. Tara thinks it's her time to shine and calls for an interview. Don answers and says she is the first to call for the position. He tells her he is familiar with her work and will call back when he has time for an interview. Tara hangs up and sees Sam behind her, making a phone call to Don. From what Tara can hear, Don likes Sam too.<br/><br/>At 2:40 am, Don calls Tara. Don wants to see her that evening for an interview. Tara says yes but knows there is a snowstorm coming to the town. She believes Don is testing her abilities. So she goes to work early to figure out the logistics. It's too late to book a flight or a train, so Tara must drive.<br/><br/>Tara leaves, but the GPS keeps rerouting her because of road closures. She drives toward a police-enforced detour and begs to go forward. The officer won't let her through, but he informs her an inn is within miles. She drives to the Mistletoe Inn, and Sam is behind her. Olivia, the innkeeper, says they are closed for the off-season. Olivia says she has one bedroom with a couch available. Tara offers the couch to Sam.<br/><br/>Sam and Tara call Don to update him. In a static-filled call, Don tells them to record a short news segment and send it to him, and he will decide based on their segment sample. Sam wanders into the basement and finds a trove of Christmas decorations. After the Christmas festival flopped a few years ago, the mayor decided not to have it. And they never had it again. Tara wants to cover the Christmas Festival for her segment. Sam wants to bring Christmas back to the town and report on the party. Who will win?<br/><br/>In any other movie, Tara would be the out-of-touch, evil boss, and Mia would be the main character. Tara's jealousy is center stage. She believes opportunities fall into Sam's lap without him trying. However, he has a relaxed approach that invites others to give him information and assistance. While Tara and Sam have chemistry and the townspeople are charming, this movie blends in with all the others this season, like Cloudy with a Chance of Christmas.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara wants to pitch her dating app to tech genius Elliot Everest face-to-face. Tonight, she plans to crash Elliot's holiday staff party. She hacks the guest list and has several color bands in her purse. Tara's aunt Rhonda applauds her tenacity but tells Tara to be careful.<br/><br/>Tara walks to the party confidently and runs into Tre with coffee. It spills on his suit and her. The tux is his design and can withstand spills. Tara can tell Tre is also a party crasher and decides to help him get into the party through the kitchen. Tre wants to show his designs to Elliot's daughter, London. London is a social media influencer who can make his brand global overnight. Tara sees London arguing over FaceTime with her boyfriend, Canyon, and overhears Canyon breaking up with London. London ignores Tara but makes a B-line for Tre because she can use him to make Canyon jealous. Tre and Tara pretend they are cousins to get into the party.<br/><br/>Tara tries to pitch her app, but it won't open. Elliot walks away, telling Tara to make an appointment. Then Tara sees a decoration spark and fall. She pushes Elliot out of the way and saves him. Elliot is grateful, but his wife, Sapphire, sees Tara's a crasher and wants to kick Tara and Tre out. Elliot wants Tara to stay, and London pleads for Tre.<br/><br/>Sapphire gets a call from her Christmas Brunch planner. He can't plan her party, and no designers can work with this short notice over the holidays. Sapphire pulls Tara aside to talk, and Tara says her last name is Aries. Sapphire asks if Tara is related to party planning expert Calvin Aries, and Tara lies. Tara says she is Calvin's niece. So, Sapphire hires Tara as her party planner, and London hires Tre to make her dress after feeling his suit. Tara has to plan a party, keep up a lie, and find time to cleverly present her app with Elliott while falling in love with Tre as he falls for London. Sure, she has it under control.<br/><br/>This movie amps up the crazy quickly. Tara uses high-tech and quick wit to sneak into homes. But her gift of gab doesn't translate into her pitches. Tre operates as her sounding board and advisor and believes in her and her app from the moment they meet. And the writers helped viewers see the love the Everest family has for each other. They put the fun in dysfunctional. Tara's lies are the antagonist in this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mercedes is a married mother of two and works as a marriage counselor. Her husband, Matthew, reminds Mercedes that their daughter, Ashley, has a recital at 1 pm. Mercedes promises to make it but doesn't come because she meets with her financial advisor instead. Mercedes comes home in time for dinner with their friends, Faith and Caleb, but only talks about herself, her clients, and her business. Caleb interjects and tells Matthew to announce his good news. He will head the biggest project in the company's history. Mercedes is proud of Matthew but states he should be a partner.<br/><br/>Later, Matthew decides to leave Mercedes because she puts work in front of everyone and everything. Mercedes goes to a bar to drink her troubles away and talks to a man, David, sitting next to her. She wishes he could see what her life would be like without her. David grants her wish. Matthew will get a life without her, but Mercedes will get one without him. Can she handle the truth?<br/><br/>Mercedes values success and the appearance of success more than anything else, and family comes second. Mercedes has wealth, a mansion, and a successful practice in her new life, but she doesn't have Matthew, her children, or her friends. The writers did a great job of recapping Mercedes's life before her husband. She used an old video camera, news clippings, and photos to review her childhood and rise to the top. Mercedes uncovers an unlikely friend in a burlesque dancer named Candy. Candy shows Mercedes true and unwavering friendship and kindness. This film warns viewers to be careful what they wish for, because they might get it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Someone is out for Olivia and will try again to murder her.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of moving parts because its two storylines in one.

Hannah was one of eleven applicants, and she got it. Hannah's friends, Scott and Jane, take her bowling to celebrate and unwind. Jane tells Hannah about a new app called Clique. Jane makes Hannah a profile. After bowling, Hannah senses someone following her and turns to see Eli. He blames Hannah for not getting the scholarship because he was the second in line. When Eli gets hostile, Scott defends Hannah.<br/><br/>Hannah starts talking to a cute guy named James on the app. James seems nice, but Hannah notices that he knows things she isn't telling him. Then Principal Edwards wants to see Hannah again. Hannah's teacher claimed she plagiarized her latest paper.

Hannah panics and needs to find who set her up before she loses her scholarship. But looking under that rock will put Hannah's life in danger.<br/><br/>The title is misleading because only one person dies. This movie introduces several suspects, including Hannah's new love interest, Kevin, and eliminates them one by one. The backing track for this movie is one of the best in a Lifetime film, and it helps viewers feel the suspense and fear. Yes, the story did leave an opening for part two.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
