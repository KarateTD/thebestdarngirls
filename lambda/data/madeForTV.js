    "review": "Darius arrives home after retiring early. He finds his daughter, Kai, in bed with her boyfriend, Isaiah. He kicks Isaiah out and forces him to walk home because Darius blocked his car. Isaiah makes it home and explains to his mother, Chef Kelly, that Darius has his car. Kelly and Isaiah drive to Darius's home and demand her son's car. Darius grounds Kai for the foreseeable future, and Kelly confiscates Isaiah's phone.<br/><br/>Days later, Darius and Kelly get a call from the school. Kelly and Isaiah's ex-girlfriend, Julie, got into an altercation. The principal won't let it affect their record if the teens and the adults help clean the school. Later, they reunite at a club after both have had horrible dates. They leave together and kiss on the street. However, they can't ignore their passion. They tell Kai and Isaiah, and the teens explode. It will be detrimental to their reputation in high school. Kelly and Darius keep their relationship private. Will the romance fizzle out when it goes public and hurts their children?<br/><br/>This film has a very slow pace with moments of shock and awe. It presents like one of Terry McMillan's books. The lead characters have a tragic backstory. The audience will understand Kai and Isaiah's issues with their parents' dating. Your significant other possibly becoming your stepsibling is weird. However, the audience will not sympathize with their childish response. After a tense moment in the bathroom, the characters realize what is important to them. It's up to the audience to stick with the story until then. This movie is for the easy-going viewer who needs a touch of drama with a love story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Calli attends a dance and meets a young man named Trent. They dance for a song, and he leaves to get her punch. Then, the church elder, Nicholas, approaches. He warns Calli that Trent has spiked girls' drinks. He asks her for a dance, and she leaves Trent behind for Nicholas. Nicholas tells his wives, Mary, Abbie, and Beth, that he plans to marry Calli next. Hopefully, she will bring him a male heir.<br/><br/>Nicholas meets Calli's mother, Rebecca, to ask for her blessing. Rebecca is ecstatic that her daughter will have the honor of marrying an elder. Calli is unsure because her aunt Leah married Nicholas, and she ran away from him. Rebecca approves of the marriage but wants something in return. Nicholas offers to buy Rebecca a house. Calli is Nicholas's fourth wife and expects to fall into wedded bliss. However, she finds jealousy, affairs, and abuse.<br/><br/>The film begins with Leah escaping Nicholas's clutches. So, the audience knows he is the antagonist. However, you aren't ready for the underhanded games of the first wife, Mary. She will drug, sabotage, and manipulate any situation. The overall plot isn't new for this channel, and the storyline ends as expected. However, it will entertain you with creepy, OMG moments for 2 hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "In 1966, Stephanie bought her first home solo and enjoys covering it with her Christmas spirit. Then, she gets a call from her favorite TV show.

Then, she admits to her deception. She gave them her neighbor's address when she applied because their house was bigger. She walks over to 7 Cherry Lane and asks them to host the show. David says no, but Curtis says yes. He gets David to cave. As they set up, she admits one more secret. Stephanie told them she was married. Can they keep the lie alive on live TV?<br/><br/>In 1981, Kyle and Piper arrive at 7 Cherry Lane to spend time with Kyle's co-worker, John, and John's wife, Lizzie, and their daughter, Ivy. Kyle and Piper enter the home, and the men find a quiet corner. Kyle asks John if John's considering taking over his position. It's better pay and better hours, but he would have to move. John hasn't spoken to Lizzie about it. Lizzie whispers to Piper in the kitchen. She learned that she's pregnant. Their secrets won't be quiet for long because Ivy loves to eavesdrop.<br/><br/>In 2000, Recently divorced, Rebecca has settled into her home. Her neighbor, Daisy, stops by.

Daisy tells Rebecca that people on Cherry Lane love to spread kindness. Daisy exits, and Rebecca's best friend, Matt, arrives. The spirit of Cherry Lane takes over Matt, and he encourages Rebecca to spread kindness to her new neighbors. However, the neighbors can see a spark between them. It's the past of 7 Cherry Lane that brings it to Rebecca's attention.<br/><br/>This 4th installment of the Cherry Lane series doesn't disappoint. The clothing styles between the 80s and the 2000s don't change much, but the furniture makes a statement. The three stories connect in unique and heartwarming ways, like the previous movies. Some connections are obvious while others are subtle. And this film spotlights the first three movies. The 'Daisy' link never fails. This series can continue for years to come, and it will be a delight. Soon, Hallmark can have 24 hours on Cherry Lane.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Ivy smiles on her date with her friend's cousin, Callum. However, he won't let her speak. She tries to make a hasty exit, but he extends the conversation. Ivy agrees to meet with him later to make Callum leave. She calls her friend Andrea as she mopes in her car. Ivy decides to give Callum another try.<br/><br/>Callum takes Ivy on a canoe ride to a remote island. He pulls the canoe up onto the island, but Ivy expresses her fears that it will float away. He assures her it's okay. She drags it forward when his back is to her. Unfortunately, Ivy drops the canoe on a large metal shard. They connect on the island and board the boat to head to the mainland. However, the canoe takes on water, and they row back to the island. Callum steps on the shard and gets a deep cut. He discovers that Ivy put the hole in the boat. Now, they are alone on the deserted island, and no one knows they are there. Will someone find them before they kill each other?<br/><br/>This film will split viewers because Ivy was correct about their first date, and Callum did everything wrong. However, their second date mishaps were her fault. Their time on the island allows the couple to have meaningful and spiritual conversations about relationships, loss, and expectations. The scenes with Andrea are eye-opening because she is the voice of reason for everyone. If you were on the East Coast of the United States, this film may get cut off early. So set your DVR to catch the movie in its entirety.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "In 1960, Eli's father, Walter, is staying with Eli and his wife, Penny, and their son, Alex, at 7 Cherry Lane this Christmas. He's healing after breaking his hip. However, Walter nitpicks at everything Eli does. Eli is at his wits' end and wants to end the holiday. However, Penny pleads with Eli to find common ground with Walter for Alex's sake. Eli knows it won't be easy, but he's willing to do anything for Penny.<br/><br/>In 1998, Ivy and Hector visit Regina. This Christmas is the tenth without her husband, Greg, and her kids are snowbound in another town. Ivy cares deeply for the family because Greg helped her mother give birth to her at 7 Cherry Lane. Regina attempts to prepare a meal, but the pipes are frozen. Regina calls a plumber, and Nelson arrives. Ivy and Hector want Regina to find love again and feel the spark between them. So they leave to give Nelson and Regina time alone. Will this magical address ignite the fires of love again?<br/><br/>In 2015, Jessie and Max planned on having a Christmas wedding while staying at Jessie's sister's home. Max rushes in with horrible information. He drove past their venue, and it's closed for good. Jessie's sister, Beth, wants to consider other options, but it's Christmas Eve. Jessie discussed getting married in Beth's backyard during the planning process. She asks Beth to have the 30-guest wedding at 7 Cherry Lane. And Beth's ex-boyfriend, Pastor Tim, will officiate the nuptials. Beth begrudgingly agrees to a small event. She has no idea how big and how complicated it will get.<br/><br/>This third installment in the Cherry Lane series has two plots following the Hallmark framework. The third story focuses on strengthening familial bonds. The latter will draw your attention and spark complex memories for the viewers. This plot links all three plots in the foreground and the background. So keep your eyes and ears open. The design team won again with three distinctive sets with a quirky and original style. Don't be surprised if 1960 is your favorite. This movie isn't the best of the series, but it is entertaining.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
