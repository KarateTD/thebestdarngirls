    "review":"Dr. Rachel is a successful T.V. psychotherapist.  After wrapping the last show before her hiatus,Rachel's assistant, Samantha, tells Rachel the producers fired Bill. The boss calls Rachel into his office and confirms the bad news.  Bill is gone.  Deborah will be the new producer and has a lot of ideas.  Deborah wants to attract a younger audience.  So she wants to pair Dr. Rachel with a famous YouTuber named Alden. Alden is excited, but Rachel is disappointed.  Rachel's boss tells her to go home during the hiatus and let the changes grow on her. Once in Midway, Rachel sees her dad at his therapy practice. At a local coffee shop, Rachel bumps into Mitchell.  She and Mitchell dated in the past, but Rachel broke it off to work in Hollywood.  Rachel will use her time in Midway to discover her purpose at work and in life.<br/><br/>This movie takes the long way to the point.  It's well-written that Rachel comes to her professional decision without using Mitchell as a factor.  But it's easy for the viewer to see how that choice will resolve itself.  You start to lose interest in the story.  A cute kid saves the plot, but the connection has little screen time. The movie may be sweet, but it will not be a favorite.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Go-Go music is the official sound of DC.  But that declaration didn't happen overnight.  First, Chuck Brown noticed the crowd's reaction to a percussion beat with no break while playing in the Maverick room.  This musical break was the first step into Go-Go music.  With the godfather of Go-Go introducing the classic sound, other groups like EU, Junkyard Band, Rare Essence, and others added Gospel, Funk, and R and B to make the style their own.  While the globe posters and street crews help spread the word of Go-Go shows, the mainstream media couldn't capture or understand the magic in the live performance. Withstanding government sanctions, the crack epidemic, and a change in sound, Go-Go is facing its greatest adversary: gentrification.<br/><br/>Now, this documentary is for fans and non-fans alike.  It takes a loving and critical view of the music native to DC.  While Go-Go has tried to remain fun and lighthearted, it was forced into the political realm when politics came for the music.  Now, Go-Go has found a voice in the movement for culture and recognition, but never acceptance.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, young Jake saw a young mechanic named Matti working in her father's garage and was smitten.  Today, Matti is an engineer working with combustion engines.  She is headed back to her hometown for her sister, Claire's wedding. Back at home, Claire's serious side shocks Matti.  Claire is worried about the cost of the wedding.  Even with their father's help, Claire and her fiance, TJ, can't afford it. With the wedding only weeks away, Claire still hasn't booked a band, picked flowers, or a color scheme.  Bewildered by Claire's struggles, Matti goes to her father's autobody shop.  Jake is his right-hand man. So they decide to put Matti's family name to good use and ask people her father has helped in the past with wedding items.  During the deal-making, Jake feels the connection with Matti.  But Matti loves Devin.  It will take a bachelor party, a ruined iPad, and a promotion to help Matti see the truth.<br/><br/>While this movie has a familiar ending, the destination to get there is slightly different.  Matti is very outspoken when it comes to her job. But her romantic relationship is another matter. This contrast between personal and professional will resonate with the viewer.  Both Clarie and Matti are struggling with who they were, who they are, and who they want to be.  You are engrossed as each woman figures it out.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara is envious of her best friend, Jenny.  Jenny met her birth mom, who lets her do whatever she wants.  Now, Tara wants to meet her birth mom.  Tara's adoptive mom says no because the adoption agency warned her to keep Tara away from her birth mom.  After a medical scare, both Tara and Amy are curious and start the process in secret.  Tara takes a DNA test to find her mother while Amy calls the adoption agency.  Tara gets her results and meets with her birth mother, Grace, in secret.  Tara mentions Amy contacted the adoption agency for records, putting Grace on notice.  So, Grace finds the agent and kills her. Amy calls Grace and sets up a meeting.  Amy and Grace talk until Amy is comfortable introducing Grace to Tara.  A few days later, Amy has a surprise for Tara.  She introduces Tara to her birth mother, Grace. Tara pretends it's the first time.  They sit, look at photos, and laugh, but Grace tries to make a quick exit and has a fainting spell.  Amy insists that Grace spends the night, then the madness begins.<br/><br/>Lifetimers, you get a shovel and a great plot twist.  For the first thirty minutes, you believe you know where the plot is going.  So you will be tempted to divert your attention.  It is a huge mistake.  This movie saves itself from the Lifetime cliches by giving you the twist early.  You become so preoccupied with the plot that you can't turn away.  This movie deserves your full attention with tea to sip and pearls to clutch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
