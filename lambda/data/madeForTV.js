    "review":"Ava hides her graduate acceptance letter when Shane, the father of her unborn child, walks into the house. Shane sits on the couch and finds Ava's acceptance letter between the cushions.  He reminds her that they don't have money for her to go to school.  But when she tries to object, Shane hits her. Later that night, Ava sneaks out of the house and runs to Kyle.  Kyle gives her a car with a full tank of gas and a hug.  As Ava drives down the road, she calls her estranged sister, Lilla.  Ava explains to Lilla that she needs a place to stay for herself and her unborn baby.  Then the light rain becomes a downpour, and Ava crashes off the road.  She wakes in a bed she doesn't know.  William enters and explains that he and his wife, Valerie, found her on the side of the road. Seeing the dire predicament, Ava agrees to let the couple help her and her unborn baby girl.  However, two people are looking for her, Lilla and Shane. Under normal circumstances, being off the grid while a murderous ex-boyfriend is looking for you is excellent.  But Ava is oblivious to the danger William and Valerie will inflict if Ava doesn't save herself and leave their home.<br/><br/>This movie is about twisted loyalties and redemption, but don't mistakenly look away.  Missing five minutes of this film will leave you lost in the weeds. This movie crashes to a bloody end of redemption with no one calling the police.  Be prepared for an entertaining watch, but you will need to give it your full attention.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Willow takes her big sister, Tess, out for a ride to a spectacular home in an affluent neighborhood.  Tess's husband, Mark, walks out of the home and surprises Tess. He bought the house as a gift for her because she passed the bar.  Looking at the size of the home, Tess has no idea how they can afford it. There was a murder in the house.  The previous couple, the Clarks, died in a murder-suicide after Mr. Clark killed Mrs. Clark and himself. As she dumps the trash outside, Tess's neighbor, Shelby, comes by and introduces herself.  Shelby invites Tess on a walk and won't take no for an answer.<br/><br/>During the walk, Shelby spots Mr. Seever, an older, cranky, weird man.  Then, she points out Dave, a handsome neighbor that keeps to himself. When Mark comes back, Tess tells Mark that the house is creepy without him. Mark goes out of town again, and David asks Tess to let in a plumber.  As she walks around David's home, test finds a locked basement with sounds echoing from behind the door.  Before she could investigate, the plumber interrupts her, and she leaves.  Later that night, someone breaks into Tess's home.  Just before the robber attacks Tess, David jumps in and saves her.  She watches over David to ensure he is ok after suffering a head injuring.  When Tess leaves David's house to go home, Mr. Seever tells Tess that Tess is wrong for being in a man's home when Tess is married.  And if she isn't careful, she could end up like Mrs. Clark. She doesn't believe Mr. Clark killed his wife and himself, and she will risk the life of her family and herself to find the truth.<br/><br/>This movie gives a quality mystery for the first hour with memorable jump scares.  But the second hour becomes the typical Lifetime movie.  After a while, you believe that Tess needs to spend more time finding a job than spying on the neighbors. Even with its The Shining moment, the plot gives the killer's identity away too soon to keep you in your seat.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Helen argues with her daughter, Kelly, and Kelly leaves in a rage. When Helen sees the police, she knows Kelly must have sent them.  But Helen is wrong.  Kelly and her unborn baby died in a car crash.  Distraught, Helen refuses to talk to the police and attacks an officer with a knife. A mental hospital labeled Helen with extreme codependency.  Helen spends nine months in a mental institution before her release.  It's been one month after Helen's release, and Grace, a social worker, comes over for a mandatory wellness check. It pleases Grace to see Helen taking responsibility, but Grace wants Helen to join a support group for women her age.  As Helen walks Grace out, she sees a new family moving into the home across the street and introduces herself.  The married couple is Sara and Kyle.  Three years into their marriage, they struggled with infertility, and Kyle cheated on Sarah with Angela. Sarah admits the whole sordid past to Helen while Kyle is on business.  Helen offers to be a shoulder for Sarah to lean on day or night, especially when Sarah finds out she is pregnant.  But this isn't an offer Sarah should take.  Kelly wasn't Helen's daughter.  Helen met Kelly once on the internet and fixated on Kelly and Kelly's unborn baby after Helen's real daughter, Layla, committed suicide.  Over the years, Helen has collected and killed several daughters.  And if Sarah isn't careful, she will be the next one on Helen's list.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie from Helen's point of view, it will entertain you with her trickery.  Whether she hires someone or gets her hands dirty, Helen will stop at nothing to get her daughter and grandchild by her side.  Blood or not. You have an idea of her capabilities, but not how deadly she can be to others.  This movie won't be a favorite.  But if you are rooting for the killer, you will keep watching.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara's photography blog isn't launching as planned, and she waitresses on the side to make ends meet. She vents to her friend, Amy, and Amy suggests they go to her family's lakehouse before her parents sell it.  As Tara hears the word lake, she flashes back to 10 years ago.  Her brother, John, verbally abused her about becoming a photographer.  He pushed her, and her camera fell off a bridge.  Tara walked to the bottom of the bridge but couldn't find the camera.  After Tara walked to the top of the bridge, she found her camera there, but John's body in the water. Amy tells Tara to leave the past behind and have fun with her life.  After some browbeating, Tara decides to go. During a photoshoot, Tara and Amy run into Lucas - a man in need of a charger - and Amy invites him to the lakehouse.  Soon the women are at each other's throats and flirting with Lucas.  At the end of this ill-fated trip, someone will be dead.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of frenemies. As much as they apologize, they belittle each other.  It's all too easy for someone to come in and break them apart. As you watch Tara's current and past relationships, you will witness that she is an emotional punching bag for John, Derek, and Amy. After all of that, it's easy to understand who is stalking Tara, but it's why that will keep you watching.  And the 'why' is the creepiest reason in a Lifetime movie ever.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
