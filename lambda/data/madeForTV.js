    "review":"Sally and Ormand Longchamp pack their family and move for Ormand's new job at Emerson Peabody School. His children - Jimmy and Dawn - can attend the private school for free, and they have a great music program for Dawn. Also, Sally is expecting and thinks the new place is good for the baby.<br/><br/>Dawn and Jimmy attempt to keep a low profile at school, but Dawn catches the eye of Philip Cutler. Dawn dresses for gym class as the teacher enters the locker room and smells smoke. Dawn points out that smoke is coming from a locker, and the teacher finds a burning cigarette. It belongs to Clara Jean. Clara Jean wages war on Dawn by putting her clothes inside the toilet. An outsider, Louise, befriends Dawn and tells Dawn that Clara Jean is a Cutler. Their family owns the largest hotel and runs the town.<br/><br/>Dawn tells Sally about running into the Cutlers, and Sally demands that Dawn stays away. However, Dawn defies Sally and kisses Philip. After Dawn's performance, Jimmy pulls her off stage because Sally is having the baby. Dawn, Jimmy, and Ormand wait in the lobby as Sally gives birth. A security guard thinks he recognizes Ormand, but Ormand says the guard is mistaken. Sally and Ormand take home their baby girl, Fern.<br/><br/>Days later, Sally is ill after giving birth and not getting better. Sally has consumption. Sally dies, and Ormand mourns in the hospital with Jimmy and Dawn. Then, the security guard escorts police officers to arrest Ormand. A detective informs Dawn that Ormand is in jail for kidnapping her as an infant. Dawn's real name is Eugenia Cutler.<br/><br/>Dawn arrives at the large estate, and Mrs. Boston, the staff manager, directs Dawn to her grandmother's office. Her grandmother, Lillian, refuses to wake Dawn's birth parents, Randolf and Laura Jean, to meet Dawn. Dawn request that Lillian calls her Dawn, and Lillian refuses. Dawn hopes things will get better, but they will get worse. As Dawn adjusts to her new life, she will encounter emotional abuse, sexual assault, and a horrifying truth.<br/><br/>Based on Dawn by V.C. Andrews, this movie starts in true Andrews fashion. A painful secret rips apart a family while leaving a young girl in its wake. She discovers she's wealthy, but the new family is evil. A dominating woman controls everyone and wants to bend the family to her will. Then, Dawn deals with confusing feelings for Philip and Jimmy. The plot is torrid, scandalous, and rage-inducing. And fans will beg for more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Kept Mistress Killer",
    "review":"Catherine will interview for a new job with more opportunities and better pay. Catherine meets the receptionist, Pam, before the interview with Paul. Paul doesn't hide his admiration for Catherine and her work ethic. He hires her on the spot, and Catherine calls her mother, Hailey, with the good news. During the call, Catherine hears a woman, Jackie, screaming at Pam. Jackie turns around to yell at Catherine. Before security escorts her out, Jackie says Catherine took her job.<br/><br/>Catherine has a successful first day and acquires new clients. Paul gives Catherine a 10,000 dollar welcome gift and a company car. Later, Paul's soon-to-be ex-wife, Julia, comes to Catherine's home to warn Catherine that Paul is dangerous. Paul invites Catherine and Hailey to a party at his house, but Hailey decides not to come. Catherine quickly lets Paul know she appreciates his kindness with a kiss. Pam explains that Jackie became obsessed with Paul, so he fired Jackie. Also, Paul is divorcing Julia because she broke into his home and pulled a gun on him. Paul and Pam encourage Catherine to have one more drink before she leaves.<br/><br/>Catherine wakes in the morning alone in Paul's spare bedroom with a note by the bed. Catherine walks downstairs, finds a dead body in the foyer, and calls the police. Detective Barr identifies the body as Julia and collects DNA samples from Catherine. Pam and Paul have alibis for the evening, but Catherine doesn't. Catherine and Hailey are in danger, but can Catherine prove it before Detective Barr puts the handcuffs on her?<br/><br/>This movie has a compelling mystery, but the forced romance is distracting. She doesn't think twice about starting a relationship, even after meeting a disgruntled worker and a cautious ex-wife. However, viewers can push the whirlwind romance aside because the plot has several shifty characters. Viewers will receive a disappointing ending because it's rushed. Give this movie your undivided attention from the beginning but don't expect much from the ending.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Miles signs autographs for adoring fans after completing an in-store reading of his latest novel. His publisher begs Miles not to take time off to teach. Miles will teach a murder mystery writing class for bachelor students.<br/><br/>Ashley meets with her advisor about attending the lower-level writing class. He doesn't feel that it is appropriate because Ashley is a master's student who is close to completing her thesis, which is a novel. Miles is Ashley's favorite author, and she hopes to pick his brain about her book. Her advisor decides that Ashley should be Miles's teaching assistant. Ashley accepts the job.<br/><br/>Ashley and Miles meet before class. He demonstrates some of the aspects of writing and gives his students an assignment. He wants them to write the perfect murder. The students take this assignment with enthusiasm. But one person will take it too far and make someone's words a reality. Will Ashley be a victim, survivor, or perpetrator?<br/><br/>This movie has an overdone premise with compelling characters that make dumb decisions. The title gives away the film, and the twist is nonexistent. While the acting is well done, it can't help a dull script. Interestingly, a movie about writing a mystery doesn't have an enigma to solve.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Beth and Dan move to Willowvale with their daughter to open Dan's practice. Dan found a home to Beth's specifications, but she's unhappy. She feels the woods are dangerous and thinks someone is watching her. Beth goes grocery shopping, and a man warns her to leave town. Beth tells Dan about the rude man and her panic attack after. Dan tells Beth to seek therapy.<br/><br/>Beth leaves the therapy session early and almost runs into traffic. Marion snatches Beth back in the nick of time. Marion is married to the town's preacher, Jim, and runs the church's daycare center. Marion senses something is bothering Beth and encourages Beth to open up. Marion is Beth's guiding light through Beth's career, marriage, and motherhood stresses. Beth is correct to be fearful. Someone is lurking in the dark, waiting to strike.<br/><br/>This plot is one of the most disjointed in Lifetime history. The opening 20 minutes introduces Beth as a whining nag to the audience. Beth's big trauma reveal has nothing to do with the overall story and feels like a waste of time. The writer should have written this plot from Marion's perspective to give the story more depth and entertainment value. Skip this movie.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vivian catches her friend, Kate, scrolling through the latest dating app. As they debate online dating, Kate matches with Walker and sets up a date. Kate meets Walker at a restaurant, and they have a stimulating conversation. Walker deals in antiquities and travels the world. Kate thinks the worldly man is the one, but she is tumbling down a dark rabbit hole of lies, money, and mayhem.<br/><br/>This plot will feel unbelievable. But if you watch true crime docu-series, you know it has happened. These love scams are well-documented in Bad Vegan, Tinder Swindler, and Love Fraud. The person has a wild story about their life. Something awful happens to them. And they desperately need money to get help. Gradually the money they need increases, the story gets more outlandish, and the victim falls deeper in love. Take this movie as a lesson about revealing too much information and multifactor authentication.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
