    "review":"Jacquie and Tyler prepare for the Liddle family Christmas invasion.  But this year, they booked a hotel for Jacquie's family since she needs a stress-free environment during her pregnancy.  As the Liddles arrive, they have unfortunate news.  A pipe bursts at their hotel, and the family has no place to stay.  Without consulting Jacquie, Tyler offers to let them stay at their home. With everything going on, Jacquie questions her abilities to be a mother.  This Liddle family must come together to support each other.<br/><br/>The next movie in the Liddle trilogy does not disappoint.  It provides all the love, laughs, and craziness fans expect. This film leaves you with a conclusion on each character, but you will always want more.  With a wild younger sister, high-strung big sister, and compromising middle sister, fans can relate to someone in this family.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"As Kristen validates her author's book, she gets a phone call from the police.  After six years, the police found her daughter, Olivia, alive.  Kristen and her estranged husband, Justin, wait at the police station and see the police questioning a waif-like figure in a hoodie. They bring her to Kristen's home and give Olivia space.  But when Olivia goes to the guest room, Justin thinks something is off.  Kristen believes it's a side effect of trauma and ignores it. Over the next few days, Olivia will fight to keep her family.  Too bad they aren't her family.  What will it take for Kristen to see and accept the truth?<br/><br/>This movie is a bit wild.  But it is the movie's crazy nature that keeps you watching from beginning to end. She is a desperate woman that wants her child back at any cost.  As Kristen does the unthinkable and unravels the mystery, she will find the evil in the truth, and you will watch from the beginning to an oddly satisfying end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jamie comes home to celebrate the holidays and his grandfather's memory.  When he settles in, his family asks about his girlfriend, Emily.  He tells them she has to work and can't make it for Christmas. When Jamie goes to the airport with his sister, Becca, she spots Emily getting off the plane. Jamie admits to Emily that he lied to his family for five months and never told them about their break-up.  Emily agrees to keep up the lie but has a room booked at a hotel to escape Jamie's deceit.  However, when she tries to check in, Emily gets a shock.  Her boss, Daryl, booked the room under his name, and Emily can't change the reservation. Jamie extends the offer to stay at his parents' place again.  She says yes but with conditions.  Her celebrity endorsement fell through for her company's campaign.  Jamie works as a speechwriter for the governor.  She will lie if Jamie can get the governor for her campaign.  Jamie agrees. With a wedding-focused family watching their every move, can Jamie and Emily keep up the lie?<br/><br/>Score one for Becca.  This funny sister will have you laughing until it hurts.  She, like most sisters, wait for the best and worst moment to comment or quip at Jamie's expense.  She will have you watching until the end. You know how the story will end but watch for Jamie's reason for the break-up and the lie.  It allows viewers to see a man's vulnerabilities.  This insight is refreshing in a Hallmark movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
