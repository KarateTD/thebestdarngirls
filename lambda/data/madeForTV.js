While two men grab Memphis, one shoots Sasha in the shoulder.<br/><br/>Sasha wakes up, handcuffed to a hospital bed with detectives questioning her. Sasha says nothing and demands a lawyer. Five years later, Sasha calls her friend, Jewel, from jail to confirm Sasha's release pick-up. Jewel can't make it, but she asked an old friend, Malik, to do it. Malik turns on the charm, but Sasha rejects him. Sasha is not over Memphis. Sasha learned Memphis died while she was in prison.<br/><br/>Sasha and Jewel reconnect, and Jewel offers Sasha a place to stay, clothes, and a car. However, Jewel doesn't tell Sasha the presents are from Malik. Malik comes to Sasha's job and succeeds by getting a date with her. Sasha thinks she has her life on track, but Malik hides a dark side.<br/><br/>Based on Lawainna Patterson's play, Bid for Love displays one woman's trip through self-discovery.

After a few threats, the man leaves. Melissa confronts Kevin.

Kevin is the perfect villainous victim. To make this film more intriguing, it has plenty of OMG moments to make you perk up. So don't let the setup make you give up on this plot. It's worth it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Eva stands in her driveway, going through a box of her late husband's things. Then someone jumps out and grabs her. Her daughters, Sami and Grace, run out of their house and towards Eva's muffled screams but find no one there. Eva's mother-in-law, Nancy, takes care of Grace and Sami while Sami makes 'missing person' flyers. Nancy thinks Eva killed her son, Ryan. After a week with no word, Sami finds Eva lying on the sidewalk in a diabetic coma.<br/><br/>One year later, Eva has her life on track and a new job, but she will need to move to New York. Nancy thinks Eva is running from a guilty conscience, and Eva kicks Nancy out of the house. In the morning, Eva is gone.

Detective Campbell promises to look into Sami's concerns after 48 hours, but Sami refuses to wait for Detective Campbell and recruits her friend, Gabe. Sami vows to find out who kidnapped Eva for the 2nd time.<br/><br/>To quote Samuel L. Jackson, hold on to your butts because this movie will take you on a wild ride. The story keeps viewers guessing with secret meetings, money hand-offs, secret rooms, and a sketchy death. Sami starts as the typical Lifetime spoiled brat, but she redeems herself quickly. Within 30 minutes, you will cheer for Sami and her bad attitude.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Romance Wedding",
    "review":"Years after opening her wedding business with Nick, Zoe feels drained. Zoe wants to take time off but doesn't feel like she can. Til she gets a call from her mom, Celeste. Zoe's dad, Richard, broke his leg working in the garden, so he can't cook for their café. Zoe offers to come back to Romance, Oregon, and help.<br/><br/>When she arrives, Celeste tells Zoe the truth. They don't need her at the café because they already have her ex-boyfriend, Will, cooking. She drives to her parents' home and stops at Mason Farm. Zoe notices the 'For Sale' sign and gets an idea. She wants to buy the farm and turn it into a wedding venue. She tells Will, and he says, 'absolutely not.' Mason Farm belongs to his parents. If he doesn't sell the farm soon, he will have to use his savings to cover the payments. Without his nest egg, he can't start his dream restaurant. Also, he thinks farmland should stay farmland and nothing else. Will agrees if the mayor says yes, he will sell. However, Will knows it won't go through because the mayor feels like him. Zoe won't back down and will rally the town of Romance in her favor to restart her business.<br/><br/>Yes, the ending is predictable, but the plot has several layers. It's a lot to keep up with while you drool over roasted root veggies with honey and mint, banana cream pie with homemade vanilla extract, and caramel salted brownies. While this won't be a favorite of the June Grooms season, give this movie a chance. It has entertainment value and great one-liners.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
