Crystal wants her to come to the gravesite, but Kandi refuses.  While Kandi and her friend, Matthew, talk, Danielle enters.  The famous R and B group, Glow Girls, will dine at the restaurant, and she wants Kandi to be their waitress.  Kandi tries to say no, but Danielle refuses to listen.  Kandi explains to Matthew that she was in the group but left after her dad died.  After some snide and hurtful comments from April of Glow Girls, Kandi gets into a fight that goes viral.<br/><br/>Danielle fires Kandi and Matthew on the spot.  With no hope for her life, Kandi claims defeat and walks toward a speeding train.  Before she makes it, a man stops her.  Kandi walks to the bar.  When the bartender, David, tries to connect with her, Kandi asks him if he remembers her name because she frequents the bar.  He can't remember, so she walks away to a table.  A man approaches with Kandi's backpack, and she remembers him as the man who pulled her from the train.  His name is Gabriel, an angel.  She tells Gabriel to tell God to give her a new life because she hates her current state.  Kandi wakes up in a massive bed with a camera crew around her.  It's Christmas Eve again, and Kandi is a famous pop star.  She married David, and Matthew and Danielle are her employees.  On the surface, Kandi thinks her new life is perfect.  But with the money and fame she desired, Kandi will learn that the same demons plague her life.<br/><br/>This movie is all about choices and God's will.  Kandi talks about hating her life every moment of the day and drinks to numb the pain of losing her father.  In her new life, she does the same.  Fame and money didn't change the hurt.  It only magnified it.  This film helps bring spirituality into the season and is a comforting watch with excellent singers.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Katie says her final goodbyes before heading to a new job in New York.  Saying farewell to her grandfather, Sam, was easy.  However, her father, Gordon, won't make eye contact.  And her ex-boyfriend, Jake, concerns himself with business because Gordon gave him the family lumber yard to manage.  As Sam drives Katie to the airport, several ambulances and police cars pass them.  She tells Sam to turn around.  Katie finds Gordon screaming in pain.  She tries to run towards him, but an EMT, Harrison, rudely stops her.  Katie calls Ms. Whittaker, her new boss, to change the start date.  But Ms. Whittaker refuses, and Katie loses her job before she starts.  One day, Jake comes to Gordon's home and tells Gordon to accept the offer.<br/><br/>Business slowed down, and now they can't afford the yearly bonus or the Christmas Festival of Lights.  Katie goes to the local bar to figure things out, and she sees Harrison holding a newspaper.  Inside, it states that the lumberjack grand prize is $50,000.  She secretly enters.  But she doesn't know Harrison is in the contest and her heart too.<br/><br/>This movie offers a minor change of pace to the holiday love story.  When Harrison and Katie discover they are in the same competition, they don't hate each other or go into battle mode.  They have fun and wish the best for the other. You add a few loggers and a WWE Hall of Famer, and you got a holiday standout.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tony opens Warm Wishes and tells his sister, Maggie, that someone is assessing the business later. The family anxiously waits for Winterfest but none more than Maggie.  Every year, their mother hand-crafted a heart and sold it all year.  Since she passed, they recreated past hearts, but interest wanes, and the shop loses business.  Maggie is trying to create a new heart, but she can't get it right.<br/><br/>Belinda enters town to find out she has a 5-night stay instead of two.  Belinda heard about the hand-crafted Milagros heart and the legend it holds.  But she wants to learn about the family.  She meets with Tony about the business and its direction.  As they fall for each other, Tony and Belinda's company have different futures for Warm Wishes.  Can Belinda keep her job and Tony if Maggie can't get the next heart crafted in time?<br/><br/>The love the family has for each other resonates off the screen.  However, Lifetime makes the brave decision to cover microaggressions in this holiday film.  He is understandably offended.  And he has a right to be.  While this is a holiday movie, this dash of consciousness is needed during the holiday too.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The town of Dickens is abuzz with excitement because it is the 100th anniversary of the festival that has A Christmas Carol play as its grand finale.  Cassie will direct, and Ray Muller will play Scrooge. When the Mayor asks Cassie to come to his office, she thinks he wants an update.  But he has unfortunate news.

They can ask hometown hero and action star Jake to be in it.  He hasn't been home in years, but the Mayor tells Cassie to contact Jake's brother, Craig, for information.  When her assistant accidentally FaceTimes Jake, Cassie talks to Jake's assistant, Ben. At first, Jake says no.<br/><br/>Then he says yes after a production company turns him down for a serious role because he doesn't have meaningful work on his resumé.  While Cassie wants to say no, she needs a star to pad her director career.  So they start working together for their respective careers but end with love.<br/><br/>There is a distinct moment that saves this movie from everything else.  It's when Jake takes Cassie's direction and acts from the depth of his soul.  You will want to see the play in its entirety.  His acting adds a new layer to his character and himself.  It is beyond measure.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Daughter's Deceit",
    "review":"Suzanne, divorce attorney, answers callers during a radio show, and she gets a creepy caller.  The caller wants to know how Suzanne sleeps at night while destroying people's lives.  Suzanne goes home when someone attacks her in her driveway.  Before Suzanne can understand the severity of the situation, a woman comes to Suzanne's rescue, but the woman gets hurt.  Suzanne sees the woman, Cassie, is injured and invites Cassie into her home for medical attention, and she shows Cassie that the robber's gun is fake.  Cassie tells Suzanne she was in the area because she nannies for the neighbors, but she is looking for work now.  The next day, Suzanne gets horrific news.  Her housekeeper, Farrah, died after she walked in front of a car.  After the funeral, Suzanne's husband, Clay, reminds Suzanne that she has a dinner party coming up.  She either needs to cancel or find someone to replace Farrah.  Suzanne remembers Cassie and calls for her help.  It's not long before Cassie is a part of the family.  But Suzanne is making a grave mistake.  Cassie's name is Kate.  Years ago, Suzanne helped represent her father in her parents' divorce.  When her mother, Fiona, walked away with no alimony or child support, Fiona blamed the lawyers and crashed her car, killing herself and injuring Kate.  This little girl grew up with revenge on her mind.  And with Suzanne's open invitation, Cassie will serve murder.<br/><br/>With a high body count and one-liners, this movie is funnier than it's scary.  Make sure to have your LMN bingo card near because this movie has perfume, nut allergies, and a drowning.  Cassie destroys Suzanne's life with an app, a sex tape, and cleverly-timed moments.  You will be waiting for the moment Cassie learns the truth about Fiona.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
