    "review":"Unmarried Olivia Winfield is unlike any woman of her time because she works outside the home and is a partner in her father's company. Mr. Winfield tells Olivia they will have a guest for dinner. The guest is the very wealthy and single Malcolm Foxworth. Olivia and Malcolm have a battle of wits. Impressed, Malcolm invites her to go on a walk.<br/><br/>Olivia is falling head over heels, but Malcolm isn't forthcoming about his family. It's not too long before the two get married. Malcolm tells Olivia that managing his grand-scale home will be a full-time job as they arrive. And he expects Olivia to handle it with grace and his standards. Olivia finds the house overwhelming but decides to handle it full steam ahead. Olivia's years of overseeing a company could never prepare her for Malcolm, Foxworth Hall, and the evil inside.<br/><br/>Based on Garden of Shadows by V.C. Andrews, this movie is the four-part prequel to Flowers in the Attic. Olivia tells her history in her last will and testament because she never could before. This movie should come with a trigger warning because it displays sexual assault. It will be uncomfortable to watch but allows viewers to see what caused Olivia to break mentally. And the cinematography of the home helps you see this beautiful mansion as a prison or gilded cage. Before watching this movie, you must see Flowers in the Attic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Robin anxiously waits for the police to declare her husband, Web, dead so she can inherit his properties. Until then, Robin wants to focus on Carrie's Crystal Water Foundation and developing properties around the family's new golden resource: water. Kayla walks outside to check on Tara because Tara left her private school for community college. The move seems strange to Tara's family, but it's the ideal setting for her. Kayla is making moves in the dating world. She wants to keep her ex-fianc√© in the past and enjoy her single life. But the family's name adds complication for all the women. Between a secret child, schemers, and eco-terrorist, this family has no shortage of enemies. They have so many on their heels that they have their eyes on the wrong nemesis.<br/><br/>Wow! Oh, wow! This movie takes the definition of twist and turns and throws it into a tornado. The plot carefully introduces new characters, establishes familiar faces, and gives you business classes in two hours. The storyline helps propel each character's story forward and gear you up for the next movie. And special applause goes to the wardrobe, hair, and makeup team. The women are runway and business ready with flawless style viewers will want to duplicate. Kudos on rebooting the series with more zeal, drama, class, and fashion than the first season.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Jailbreak Lovers",
    "review":"Toby and her husband, Pat, are empty nesters, and Toby looks for something new to fill her time. Toby works at the local animal shelter, but a local news story inspires her. The program matches dogs with inmates to domesticate the animals so the rescue shelter can find the dogs a forever home.<br/><br/>Warden Jenkins approves the program, and Toby brings two dogs with her co-worker, Deb. Inmates Mateo and Darnell get dogs to train. As Toby gives training instructions, John walks over. He wants to join the program too. John is in jail for first-degree felony murder and robbery. He believes training dogs will bring him purpose behind bars. John gets approval, and Toby gives him a dog. After a few weeks, Mateo wants his sister-in-law to adopt his dog so he can check up on it. However, Toby can't get Mateo's family on the phone and has to give the dog to someone else. Mateo's anger boils over, and he gets in Toby's face. John steps in between them and calms Mateo down.<br/><br/>Toby meets with Warden Jenkins and requests a guard to protect her. Jenkins tells Toby that they are short-staffed and don't have the funding. John offers Toby protection and assistance bringing items from her van. Toby falls in love with John and gives him special treatment. Will she help him escape prison and leave her husband?<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Toby Dorr and John Maynard, the writers added some comedy and confessionals to this crazy love story. In the beginning, you learn that Toby lacks something in her mundane life. Helping dogs and prisoners become her mission, but you are unsure of John's motives. If you pay attention, John slowly tests her by asking for physical contact, adult pleasures, and a phone. If he can get her to bend small rules for the promise of a future, he could depend on her for more extensive favors. In honest comedic fashion, this couple's stupidity brings the story back full circle.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ice Road Killer",
    "review":"Helen drives to pick up her daughter, Lauren, for winter break. While on the phone with Lauren's school to iron out financial issues, Helen almost hits a woman on the road. The woman, Carly, says she was desperate to get someone to stop for her. Carly needs a ride to town to meet with her family. Carly agrees and gets in Helen's car. Carly opens the glove box and spots a gun. Helen says it's for self-defense, and Carly quietly nods. Carly tries not to show Helen that she is freaking out over the gun, but Carly texts her boyfriend, Boyd, the truth. Carly wants to stop their plan, but Boyd says no.<br/><br/>Carly waits for Boyd to attack when Helen picks up Lauren, but he doesn't, and the women drive to their next stop. Carly doesn't know, but a trucker blocked Boyd's car before he could attack. Carly texts Boyd again, but the trucker messages back that Boyd is dead and she is next. Helen and Lauren ride with the vengeful trucker's next victim. And he won't hesitate to make Lauren and Helen collateral damage.<br/><br/>A lot of suspenseful events driven by stupid decisions are the best way to summarize this movie. At first, viewers will believe that Boyd and Carly are the killers, but they are the least of Helen and Lauren's worries. As he hunts down the couple, you don't sympathize with them. Also, you will have little empathy for Helen because she keeps making countless mistakes. Lauren is the only person using their brain. This movie is frustratingly captivating.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma presented her latest idea to her boss, Danielle. Danielle believes Emma is the perfect choice to head their up-and-coming Seattle branch. Danielle knows Emma has a break coming for Emma's sister's wedding. She tells Emma to use that time to think about the new job.<br/><br/>Liam restores bikes but dreams of working on vintage bicycles, and he is happy to be the best man at his best friend's wedding. Liam and the groom, Brett, have been friends for years. At the mixer, Miranda and Brett introduce Liam to the maid of honor, Emma. They know Emma and Liam had one date that didn't go well, but they hope the two can get along for the wedding. Liam and Emma agree to put the past behind them and get along for the wedding.<br/><br/>With six weeks until the wedding, Miranda and Brett get called to their job site for an emergency. They don't want to postpone the wedding because it falls on their 5th anniversary. So they ask Liam and Emma to be their stand-ins and plan the wedding for them. Miranda and Brett want their wedding to be a surprise. Liam and Emma work together to create Miranda and Brett's dream wedding while falling in love.<br/><br/>While the actors try their best, this movie is slow and uninteresting. Predictable movies should be funny, dramatic, or heart-wrenching to keep your attention. However, this film doesn't accomplish any of those goals. Leave this film as background noise for a busy day.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",
