    "review": "A doctor checks on their amnesia patient, but the patient doesn't remember her name. Luckily, the doctor identified the woman as Mia, a famous romance author. A man enters the room and introduces himself as Mia's husband, Jessie. They have a daughter, Madison, in community college, and he was in the car crash with her but wasn't hurt. Madison and Jessie take Mia home. Mia remembered a woman in the passenger seat. She asks if they have another daughter. Jessie says her nightmare isn't a memory because he was the only person in the car with her.<br/><br/>Madison drives Mia to her physical therapy appointment, and Mia meets her physical therapist, Erin. The two get to know each other during their sessions. Then, Mia remembers sharing a cupcake with the woman in the car. Mia converses with Erin about the flashback as a fan named Wade approaches and asks for an autograph. He confesses that he has all of Mia's books and articles written about her. Mia asks for a copy and gives Wade her address so he can deliver it.<br/><br/>Mia returns home. She sees Jessie's new iPad and Madison's new coat. Jessie tells Mia that Mia got a 6 figure advance. Mia is uncomfortable spending the money. Jessie assures her it will all be okay. Mia asks about another daughter, but Jessie says they are a family of three.<br/><br/>Mia goes to therapy again, and Erin wonders if Wade turned in the information. Mia says no and wants to find him. Mia and Erin go to Wade's house, and an officer answers the door. Sadly, the officer tells Mia that Wade is dead.<br/><br/>Mia finds her book on the shelf and opens it. The dedication page says, 'For Angela.' Then, a man follows her into the bathroom, and Erin scares him off. She thinks Jessie is hiding something from her. The scary thing is that he's telling the truth. Well, at least a half-truth.<br/><br/>First, let's give a R.I.P. to Wade. Once he died, the script forgot about him. Second, fellow Lifetimers should be ready to scream 'the audacity' each time Jessie opens his mouth. He dismisses Mia's feelings and is very condescending. Also, Mia makes annoying mistakes that will make your blood boil. The movie has funny moments, but viewers watch to see if their hunch is correct.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Birdie and Alden take private investigator classes to fine-tune their skills. However, Birdie is worried they are becoming the Murder Couple. She wants more couple friends outside of their life of investigation.<br/><br/>Alden meets with Birdie in the parking lot after interrupting her yoga class. He tempts her into eating a donut when her old high school rival, Kristin, approaches. She invites them to her home to eat and meet her new boyfriend, Tom.<br/><br/>Birdie and Alden arrive at Kristin's home. Birdie sips wine in the kitchen with Kristin while Alden looks at Kristin's bookshelf. He finds a book from his favorite 'true crime' author, Laurel St. James. Kristin is a true crime buff, and they jump for joy. Then, Tom knocks. To their surprise, Tom is Detective Tom Newton. They sigh.<br/><br/>Across town, Laurel enters Studio 45 to record her podcast. She briefly converses with the manager, Nigel, before knocking on the window to get another podcaster's attention. She shows Pat it's 9:02 pm and forces him to leave. Laurel records her segment about a local serial killer. She says she is ready to reveal the truth. Someone walks into the studio, shoots Laurel, and leaves a note on her body.<br/><br/>Birdie and Alden hear about Laurel's murder on the news. They report that Laurel could be a victim of the serial killer. At the police station, Detective Newton investigates the podcasters and Nigel. However, Newton can't comprehend what these characters are saying. Tom's boss wants to hire someone that speaks their language. Newton grinds his teeth and calls Birdie and Alden. The Cases are on the case. Can they find Laurel's killer?<br/><br/>This mystery series is different because Alden and Birdie are a happily married couple. So, they deal with real-life issues about maintaining their marriage. Since each movie doesn't have a 'falling in love' subplot, the writers can focus on the crime. And this one is a doozy. Birdie and Alden hilariously work together to find Laurel's enemies. They do this while tracking a mouse in their home. Alden's final trap is legendary. The conclusion will throw sleuthers for a loop and bring a tear to your eye as the Cases bring closure to a town. Don't miss this second installment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Mallory asks her friend, business partner Linda, for people's names at a party. Mallory suffered from three strokes and can't recall much. She relies on Linda and her husband, Reese, to fill in the gaps. Mallory and Reese's son, Billy, ask to leave, and they oblige.<br/><br/>Mallory returns to work after her latest stroke and handles her first client with ease but can't shake her headaches. Each one comes with a flashback. Mallory picks up Billy from school, and Billy says he made a friend named Samantha, but he won't give Mallory more information. Mallory takes Billy to a climbing park to practice. Mallory sees him talking to a woman. Mallory abruptly concludes her conversation and walks over to Billy. The woman leaves, and Billy says she's Samantha. She is a part of Mallory's past, which reveals a heartbreaking truth. Can Mallory handle it?<br/><br/>The movie starts slow and leaves the viewers in the dark, like Mallory. It begins to bore you because you won't know what's happening. While the plot leaves breadcrumbs, you will only figure out part of the mystery. The film tries to be a whodunit but doesn't leave the audience enough clues to care. And the ending only leaves one person with a smile. Watch this picture if you have two hours to burn.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Naomi greets Lauren as she boards the Song of Songs ship. She wanted a career change, and Naomi got Lauren a job on the ship. Lauren meets Captain Liam and their crew chief, Amy, before the elite guests board. One guest, Mark, catches Lauren's eye, and Naomi notices. Naomi and crewmember Sara call Mark a big tuna because he is a single billionaire.<br/><br/>Lauren and Mark converse after her shift. She tells him about her business idea, and he loves it.

She wakes to find no trace of Dana on the ship. Mark says Dana left, but Lauren thinks something more sinister happened to Dana. Can Lauren uncover the truth without losing her life?<br/><br/>It's funny how everyone comes to Lauren for advice when Lauren's world is crumbling around her. Also, Mark runs shady deals in his company, but his right-hand man, Rudy, is on to Mark's corruption. This film isn't a whodunit. It focuses on sensationalism to attract its audience. This film won't be a favorite, but it entertains for two hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Dana works at Larson and Brown Law Firm, handling acquisitions and mergers. Her uncle, Paul, runs the firm and counts on Dana to take over high-profile cases. Mark is a divorce lawyer at Gale, Fauble, and Partners. He plans to become a partner within the year. Dana and Mark meet at their favorite restaurant to celebrate their 7th wedding anniversary. They take out notepads and go over grievances and gratitude.<br/><br/>Paul intersects Dana at work because their fund's biggest donor, Tabby Noble, wants to divorce her husband, Brett. She investigated Dana's job history and discovered Dana has a family court background. Dana begrudgingly takes the case and tells Tabby to keep things civil. But Tabby demands everything.<br/><br/>Mark's boss, Lois, walks him to the conference room before Mark meets his new client, Brett. Brett won't be an easy-going client, but he will bring attention to their firm. He believes he is the brains behind his and Tabby's reality empire and wants everything. Mark informs Brett that New York is an equitable distribution state, but Brett doesn't care.<br/><br/>Mark and Dana relax after work. She turns on the Noble's reality show. Mark asks why, but Dana skirts the answer and gives Mark a fidget spinner. Later, Mark meets with Brett at the gym. A server pretends to be a fan and gives Brett divorce papers before Mark can stop her. Simultaneously, Dana is at Tabby's home to smooth out the divorce details. A server pretends to be a delivery person and gives Tabby the divorce paperwork before Dana can handle it. Dana and Mark tell their clients to be quiet, but Tabby and Brett take to social media to air out their issues. Later, Dana and Mark discover they are working on opposite ends of the same case. They swear it won't affect their relationship, but can their marriage cope with the downfall of someone else's?<br/><br/>This movie shines a light on the world of reality TV without turning it into an afterschool special. They don't know reality from reality TV. And they make everyone pawns in their game. Mark and Dana question their marriage, pre-nuptial agreement, and having children during this case. And their background checks shine a light on secrets from their past. These lawyers' approach may not be popular, but it's effective. This film is funny, introspective, and captivating.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
