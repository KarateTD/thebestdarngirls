    "review": "Francine, known by her family as Fancy, calls her mother, Evelyn, before going to work. Evelyn reminds Fancy that a contractor, Jaylen, will visit Fancy's office. Fancy arrives at work, and Jaylen is there. She explains that Evelyn's eyesight is deteriorating, and her home needs updates to accommodate her.<br/><br/>Fancy arrives at Evelyn's home, and a truck blocks the driveway. She accidently bumps it while talking on her phone. Jaylen jumps out and snitches about the accident to Evelyn. They walk inside and examine the home. Jaylen discusses the changes he will make, but offers to fix the floorboard for free. Evelyn matches Jaylen's kind gesture by extending an offer for dinner.<br/><br/>At the dinner table, Jaylen learns the Ballentine women have significant others. Fancy's oldest younger sister, Deena, is married and has an infant. Fancy's youngest sister, Belle, is dating Anthony. And Fancy has been in a long-term relationship with Richard. Belle makes an announcement. She and Anthony got engaged and wanted to continue the family's tradition of getting married on Christmas Eve, in three weeks. Evelyn wants to see Belle get married before she loses her sight. The sisters relent.<br/><br/>Fancy's boss, Lyla, shocks her employees by returning to work early from her vacation. She has decided to step down and name her successor. However, she is unsure about who to choose: Fancy or Germaine. She gives them a challenge to design the best dress. Fancy takes on the challenge, but Jaylen believes Fancy is stretching herself thin. He tells her to stop and smell the roses, but Richard cheers her on to become a power couple. Can Fancy handle it all?<br/><br/>Fancy's story mirrors that of the eldest sibling. However, outsiders like Jaylen can see she is going to crack under the pressure without help. The connection between the three sisters jumps off the screen with their practical arguments and loving wisdom. Your compassion will rise as Evelyn struggles with her eyesight and faith. This film relies on the family bond to move the story forward, not the romantic plot. It's funny, endearing, and entertaining.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "An Alpine Holiday",
    "review": "Sister Faith and Kelly meet with their grandmother's executor, Henry, to discuss their grandmother's last wishes. Rebecca loved her granddaughters and wanted the world for them. She wanted them to learn something about themselves and each other by recreating the steps she and her late husband, Albert, took before their engagement at the top of the French Alps on Christmas Eve. Faith, full of wanderlust, has her bags packed. Homebody Kelly says no because it's too sudden to drop everything for a trip. Henry gives them Rebecca's travel journal before they leave the office. Later, Kelly changes her mind, and Faith jumps for joy. Kelly and Faith embark on a vacation that forces estranged sisters to be open and honest about each other and themselves. Will their bond grow or be forced apart?<br/><br/>This Hallmark holiday movie is another that puts the love stories on the back burner. It focuses on the connection between Kelly and Faith. Faith traveled the world while Kelly stayed at home with their ailing grandmother. It caused unresolved and unacknowledged friction and resentment in their relationship. It's safe to say the love stories weren't necessary for this film to be entertaining or successful. The bond between Faith and Kelly was enough to bring a tear to your eye. Hallmark must stop relying on love to sell a plot; bonds and connections are enough.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The More the Merrier",
    "review": "E.R. doctor Alice Rogers gets eight dozen cookies for the patients at her hospital. She starts to fall back as she loads them into her car, but Dr. Brian Davis catches her. She thanks him for saving her before heading to the hospital. When Alice arrives, Dr. Natalie greets Alice and reminds Alice that her brother will start his rotation there. He is a visiting cardiologist who will assist several hospitals in the area.<br/><br/>Brian arrives at the hospital, and Natalie introduces her brother to the staff. Alice remembers him from before and gives him a gentle smile. Brian asks Natalie about Alice, but Natalie admits she knows little about Alice's private life. As Alice and Brian make the rounds, Alice notices that Brian's cold demeanor doesn't connect with the patients. She needs him to change if she is going to leave. Alice, a former military brat, never stays in one place for too long.<br/><br/>As Brian and Alice continue with their rounds, Nurse Richard makes a faux pas. He says the hospital is quiet. Everyone flinches. They know the Q-word strikes chaos. And it comes true. A snowstorm hits the town, closing the roads. This small-town hospital will see a record-breaking influx of patients. They will test Brian's standard of care and Alice's connection to the people. But will it bring more for the doctors?<br/><br/>This short review can't cover the ensemble's stories. The writers gave each character a brief introduction and slowly expressed their connection to the hospital. The story didn't have any wasted characters, and the subplots are heartwarming and perfect for the holidays. In addition, keep your eyes on the screen as the title card gives astounding news throughout the film. While the story is beautiful, your mind will drift. The plot emphasizes the supporting cast so much that you won't care about the leads and their love story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secret Life of a Good Wife",
    "review": "Jenna and Carrick thank their guest during their wedding reception. Jenna takes out her phone and encourages her followers to strive for her life as a traditional wife. His parents, Clint and Mae, love Jenna and the traditional values she upholds. Carrick's brother, best man Luke, welcomes Jenna to his family with open arms. While Carrick's family is warm, Jenna's family can't hide their icy stares. Jenna's mother, Eileen, and her sister, Sarah, believe that Carrick's family and hometown are strange. Sarah doesn't think Jenna is honestly happy living under Carrick's control. Eileen says the marriage will end in disaster. After a heated discussion, Eileen exits the party after saying goodbye to her children. Later, Sarah notices that Eileen isn't answering her messages. Jenna believes Eileen left them again after drinking too much. However, Sarah knows Eileen was getting better. She concludes that Carrick and his family are involved in Eileen's disappearance. Sarah won't stop until she uncovers the truth.<br/><br/>This movie portrays the flowery tint people put on traditional marriages without destroying the core concept. As viewers watch, they should spot the red flags in Carrick's and his family's behavior. Jenna must pretend she's incapable around him. And his family crosses boundaries by forcing their ideology on her. The key takeaway from this film is the false portrayals on social media. Jenna promotes this as the best lifestyle to her followers, but she is quietly miserable. Use this movie as an example not to believe everything you see on the internet.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Snow Must Go On",
    "review": "Actor Isaiah's one-person show doesn't ignite the theater community. His sisters, Laura and Jess, beg him to return home and regroup. However, he has to work in a holiday singing group. Also, he has an audition in front of the famed Broadway producer, Cindy Santos. He skips work for the audition, but Cindy leaves early. Isaiah runs to work, but they fire him for being late. Isaiah decides to go home and stay with his sister, Jess, and his niece, Aurora.<br/><br/>Jess asks Isaiah to pick up Aurora from school. Isaiah has a few complications, but a teacher, Lilly-Anne, lets him inside. As they enter, Ms. Bedford runs out. Without her, the Christmas Show can't continue. Aurora informs everyone that Isaiah has theater experience. He says no, and Lilly-Anne agrees because no one has vetted him. The principal states that Isaiah needs a faculty member, her, to supervise him, and he can direct. They relent. Isaiah whines until he discovers that a student, Miranda, is Cindy's daughter. He will make Miranda and himself the stars to impress Cindy. Will it work? Regardless, the snow must go on.<br/><br/>The writers allowed the kids to carry this film. They are quick-witted, funny, and adorable. Hallmarkies will clammer to the finished play more than the love story. Minutes before the start, everything that can go wrong does. This panic builds the plot and the community. While the adults aren't the film's selling points, the lead actor's talents are astonishing. He can effortlessly dance, sing, and act. He is mesmerizing.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
