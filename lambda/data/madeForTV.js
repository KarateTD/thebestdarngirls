    "review":"Ashley looks for an 1875 antique angel bell at an auction and spies another man looking at it too. At the auction, he beats her with a bid of $500.  She congratulates him, but her happiness is short-lived. He is an estate lawyer with zero interest in the bell beyond monetary appreciation, and she wanted the bell for the history behind it.  Licking her wounds, Ashley gets a call from her Aunt Charlotte.  Uncle Tony broke his foot after tripping over a violin case.  Ashley decides to head back to Robinsville to help her aunt and spend Christmas with her family.  Later, they hear a knock at the door.  Amazed, Ashley sees the auction guy standing in front of her, and Tony tells her to let the man inside the house.  The man is named Duncan, Tony's estate lawyer. Tony asked Duncan to appraise things around the house, and Ashley sardonically interjects with potential items to sell. In her outburst, she mentions her mother's old red vintage Cadillac. He admits he sold the car to a collector after Ashley said she didn't want it, and Tony can do whatever he wanted with it.  She never thought he would sell the car so fast. The next day, Ashley goes into town and sees the new Mayor modernized the decorations. She wants the traditional feelings of Christmas and decides to get them back by finding her mom's old car to give it a proper send-off.  Seeing her passion, Duncan decides to help.  This search for the convertible is the first step to bring Robinsville to its former Christmas glory.<br/><br/>Don't let the promos fool you.  This film isn't a 2-hour scavenger hunt for a convertible because Ashley and Duncan find the car before the first hour.  This movie is about the town rallying behind Ashley and the car's toy drive. The town helps her find parts and fund the toys. Let's not forget the car has a little magic.  For no reason, it plays music and flashes headlights just for Ashley and Duncan.  While you are focused on their love story, don't forget that Tony has a secret, and Ashley has a new business opportunity in Seattle.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars",

    "review":"Kate finished her audition for the Rocky Mountain Philharmonic, and she is on cloud nine. As she leaves the audition, she bumps into another auditioner and drops her sheet music in a doorway.  Kate attempts to pick up the items, and the door closes on her hand.  Kate has dislocated and broken her fingers. While her doctor tells her she will fully recover with time, Kate worries she may never play the violin again.  Kate goes to her hometown to recuperate and work at her grandparents' music store.  After the doctor removes Kate's cast, he suggests Kate visits a local physical therapist to help retrain her hand to play again.  Kate is happy to see her old friend, Patrick, is her physical therapist. He promises to get her to the Philharmonic again, but with time and dedication.  Seeing her grandfather, George, teach Patrick's cousin, Gavin, how to play, inspires Kate to revamp the Malone's Music Shop Annual Christmas Party.  Can she keep that inspiration when Patrick gets an offer to leave for his dream job with Hands and Hearts? Only love will tell.<br/><br/>This movie does rightfully state the benefits of physical therapy while shining a light on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  But, the film doesn't set itself apart from other movies in this holiday onslaught.  Kate, a world-renowned violinist in real life, plays the violin in a way that will bring tears to your eyes. You can put this movie on the back burner until you need two hours to kill.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars",

    "review":"Jessica passed the bar, and she will be leaving her job as an executive assistant for Charles Darling and going to the legal sector of the Darlington company. To close out her job, Charles asks Jessica to do one last favor.  His nieces and nephew are flying in from Australia after losing both of their parents. Knowing the children will be alone at boarding school for the holiday, Jessica offers to watch them for a week until school starts.  Charles tells his younger brother, Max, his plan but Max doesn't like the idea.  So Max leaves his vacation in Aspen to help Jessica with his nieces and nephew.  Jessica is awestruck to see Max Darling standing at the Darling's door. Abby, Emma, and J. Henry are happy to see Uncle Max and Jessica waiting for them.  But they are careful to become attached, they know they won't be staying for long.  Max decides to make this holiday the best ever for the Darling children, they will make crafts, play in the snow, decorate, and bake.  Jessica will see a new side of Max and heal her childhood wounds.  And Max shows the world a different side of himself, so different it could lead him away from the kids and towards Taiwan.<br/><br/>Often we ignore the greatness in others because it doesn't fit the personal narrative created for them.  Jessica and Charles see Max as an immature, runabout.  Instead, he donates his time and money to local charities without seeking acknowledgment or praise. This is a sweet movie that doesn't use children as a prop but a means to push the story along.  So sit back, eat your Christmas Swirl Fudge, and enjoy this beautiful movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars",
