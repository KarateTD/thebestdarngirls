    "review":"Financial Strategist Melanie takes a break from work at her company Christmas party and sits with her friend and co-worker Claire. Melanie reflects because the last year wasn't easy. She and her ex-husband, Max, finalized their divorce after he left her for a woman, Lauren, whom he met at the gym. Although she is happy to bounce back emotionally from it, Melanie's relationship with her son, Jason, is on thin ice.<br/><br/>Later, Melanie gets a call from Max. Max needs to cancel his ski trip with Jason and asks Melanie to deliver the unfortunate news. Jason is upset because he told his friends about going away on a fun trip. Melanie gets online to find a last-minute vacation under a 3-hour drive to a festive location. She scrolls and discovers St. Nicolas Island Lighthouse for $200 a night. Melanie immediately books it.<br/><br/>Melanie and Jason take a water taxi to the island, but she runs to the opposite side of the boat because she is seasick. Peter warns her to return because the water is choppy, but Melanie refuses to listen because he isn't the captain. Then, she gets splashed with seawater, and Peter walks away laughing.<br/><br/>Melanie arrives at the lighthouse to find a list of chores instead of festive decorations. The chore list gives them instructions on how to decorate the lighthouse. Melanie decides to meet with the lighthouse owner for an explanation. Melanie finds the owner, Peter, and he blames her for not reading the fine print. The person staying at the lighthouse has to decorate it for the Christmas Lights Festival. Ruth, the diner's owner, encourages Peter to help Melanie and her son fix up the lighthouse for the celebration. Peter doesn't tell anyone, but this year is different. He is in town because someone wants to buy the lighthouse and use the land to make condos. Peter desires to keep the lighthouse in his family but can figure out how. Will Melanie and Peter let down their guard to expose their troubles and get help?<br/><br/>Hallmark gives an honest view of divorce in this film. Hallmark usually wants to present all divorces as friendly, amicable, and no-fault, but that isn't the case. Peter is helping Jason connect with Melanie and decorate the lighthouse. But you don't understand how she will help him until an hour and a half into the film. Also, you have the budding romance between Jason and Mayor Katy's daughter, Sara. Sara helps Jason see that Melanie is trying to be a good mom and that he is the problem. For a story deeply enriched in reality, Hallmark handles it with care.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bruised and battered, Selma calls local stations for the cheapest ticket headed in any direction. She scrounges up a few dollars and walks towards the door but hides when she hears her husband, Officer Jason, on the other side. She grabs his gun, shoots, and runs out of the home to escape.<br/><br/>Madison is a proud cheer mom to a temperamental 15-year-old daughter, Willow. Willow lashes out at Madison's strict parenting, but Madison praises structure. Madison leads a meeting with other cheer moms when she gets an unexpected knock at her door. She stands in disbelief when her little sister, Selma, is on the other side. Selma asks for a place to stay, but Madison refuses because Selma brings trouble. Madison meets Selma at a diner. Selma promises not to bring anything ill will to Madison's home, and Madison agrees to let Selma stay.<br/><br/>Madison runs errands while Selma does laundry. Selma hears something and walks around the house on high alert. She steps on broken glass and finds two men inside the home. Selma fights them off, and Madison comes home early. They get in Madison's car and drive away. The news is reporting that Selma killed Jason and is on the run with Madison. Unfortunately, two cohorts of Jason's are looking for Selma. And they will use their badges and lies to track her down. Will they succeed?<br/><br/>This movie points out that it has a Thelma and Louise plot but without their deadly ending. It does drop Lifetime gems like Madison having asthma. So, Lifetimers can countdown to her inhaler being an issue. Also, the script balances out good cop versus bad cop. There are classic protagonist mistakes, but Lifetimers expect this. This movie is enjoyable and adds a fun twist at the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Mayor Ben reminds everyone that Brookswood will continue to break world records this holiday by wrapping the most gifts in an hour. And he needs the whole town's support. Everyone agrees to join.<br/><br/>Marissa gives Charlie one gift early: Jenga. Charlie asks if his real dad, Peter, will come to Christmas this year. Charlie questions if Peter left because he has autism, and Marissa provides a definitive no. Eric wishes Charlie would call him dad, but Marissa knows Charlie's autism allows him to give one person that label. Then, Charlie gets an idea. If he breaks a world record, then Peter must come. After careful consideration, Charlie decides to break the Jenga record. He must stack 1401 Jenga blocks on one standing vertical block. Can Charlie break the record and make his dad proud?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this story will have you on your seat's edge. Charlie doesn't see autism as a limitation but as a superpower. This positive mindset allows Charlie to create and face challenges. Marissa and Eric are lovingly patient. They see signs of Charlie becoming upset and handle it with care. Even Amy assists Charlie with a news interview. The script also shows Charlie's love grow. The plot did try to save Peter's character at the end, but it was unnecessary.
