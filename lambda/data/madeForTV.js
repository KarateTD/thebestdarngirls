    "review":"The local theater company hired Ally as a stage photographer. While the stage has the play, the real show is backstage.  Cassandra, the lead, walks in late. While the author, Neil, is happy to see her, her understudy, Laura, isn't. Ally walks to Cassandra's dressing room to take photos and notices things are awry.  Cassandra blames it on pre-show jitters.  As Ally takes more pictures, Kenny, the stage manager, tells her he can't find Cassandra and asks Ally to look.  Ally finds Cassandra dead in the bowel of the theater and runs for help, dropping her badge.  Detective Sam starts his investigation and turns to see Ally.  He is unsurprised. During the preliminary investigation, Sam notices Roger, an actor in the play, walking around backstage.  Sam tells Roger to stop and stay will everyone while he questions them.  Since Ally was there and knows most of the suspects, Sam will do the one thing he never thought he would do, ask Ally for help.  This case involves lies, money, and a belt.<br/><br/>Another great installment of the Picture Perfect Mysteries, with plenty of suspects, motives, and questionable actions, you should be prepared to be glued to the screen from beginning to end. Unlike most movies on H.M.M., Detective Sam allows Ally to work with him. Lifting this restriction and rift helps push the story along, allowing Sam and Ally to become a couple sooner.  When Ally's life is in danger, you see Sam deep regard for her.  She notices too. Their compassion for one another comes through loud in clear in this movie, and you will fall in love too.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
