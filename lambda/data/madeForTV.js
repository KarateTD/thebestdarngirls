    "mtitle":"Road Trip Hostage",
    "review":"After numerous callbacks, student Emma gets her dream job dancing in a theater. She tells her mom, Hillary, about the opportunity and demanding schedule. Hillary gives Emma an ultimatum. If Emma leaves school, she has to leave Hillary's home. Emma calls Hillary's bluff, moves in with Katy, and drops out of school for the semester. As Emma moves into the building, Katy and Emma run into the landlord's son, Rick.<br/><br/>Rick goes to the home of his dad, Charles, to understand what happened to his credit cards. Charles cut him off because Rick isn't motivated to work. After a few choice words, Rick hits Charles in the head with an object and kills Charles. Rick's stepmother, Linda, locks herself in a bathroom and calls the police for help. Rick overhears the call, takes money out of the safe, and cash out of Charles's wallet. He runs home to grab a few items and calls a rideshare. He asks Emma to drive him to the airport because he is in a jam due to his rideshare cancellation. Emma agrees to take Rick to the airport. This decision will lead Emma on a highway to hell as Rick's hostage.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie starts with a plausible setup. A naive person does a favor for someone she reasonably knows. Rick doesn't snap until his aunt Mary tells him the police are on his tail. Rick's choices continue to go downhill. Not surprising because he has a clear case of affluenza. The detectives help from the beginning and don't give up on Emma. This film is for you if you like yelling at the screen. Otherwise, you may want to skip it if bad choices make you angry.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Hidden Murder Island",
    "review":"Fey survived two days in the woods alone with a head wound after her friend, Maddie, committed suicide. Curt, a newcomer to the island, rescued Fey, who suffers from amnesia. Fey's parents, Beth and Frank, invite Curt over every night for dinner. Fey wishes to leave the remote island for college in New York but hasn't gotten her acceptance letter.<br/><br/>After another family dinner with Curt, Fey washed dishes with Beth. Curt fires his new gun outside, and Fey has a panic attack with a seizure. She has visions of Maddie and red sand. Fey tells her family about the red sand, but no one believes her.<br/><br/>Fey and Frank go to the community college. Frank wants Fey to sign up for early courses while in high school, but she missed the deadline. As Frank uses his influence to enroll Fey, Fey leaves in disgust. Ali approaches Fey and asks to draw Fey for art class. They get to know each other, but a car backfiring causes Fey to have another panic attack. Fey texts Ali to join her at the Historical Society to find an old map and locate red sand. However, Sherriff Joe, Maddie's father, catches Fey and Ali breaking in and returns Fey home.<br/><br/>Beth suggests some retail therapy. During their shopping trip, Beth spies a woman, Chey, in the distance. Beth confronts Chey in the store and asks her if she is having an affair with Frank. Chey laughs and tells Beth that Beth is the cheater. Beth takes Fey for ice cream and explains that she cheated on Frank but returned after Fey's accident. Fey knew about the affair and forgave her mom. Beth breathes a sigh of relief and offers to help Fey find the red sand.<br/><br/>After searching for hours, Fey and Beth find the red sand beach with footprints. Fey remembers someone attacking Maddie and doesn't believe Maddie killed herself. She has another panic attack and wakes up at home. Fey runs to Joe's home with her new information. He doesn't believe her until he sees a button in her hand. Fey says it came from Maddie's jacket the day she died. Joe pulls it out of the closet and shows Fey it's not missing a button. He believes it came from a 3rd party. Fey won't stop until she uncovers what happened to Maddie.<br/><br/>Lifetimers, be prepared. This movie takes the scenic route to the point. And the final ten minutes give you the motive, perpetrator, and crime. Also, this film has text on the screen. So have your remote in hand in case you need to pause. The plot does drag, but you will have a searing hatred for one person at the end. That person is an egotistical, controlling, homophobic gaslighter that got off easy at the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Pinch of Portugal",
    "review":"Anna is a prep cook for Dining with Dean. It's a traveling cooking show that features recipes inspired by the local culture. The producer, Hope, catches Anna at her desk and tells Anna the next stop for the show is Portugal. However, Dean won't be coming. He is negotiating his contract and playing hardball. The show's makeup artist, Brooklyn, and cameraman, Russ, come with Hope and Anna.<br/><br/>After landing in Portugal, Anna decides to go to the local farmer's market and meet its manager, Lucas. Anna samples cheese, tomatoes, and carcaças. Lucas is dismayed that Dean isn't there, but Anna informs Lucas that Dean stays in the kitchen for interviews.<br/><br/>Hope continues to call Dean at the hotel, but his voicemail is full. If Dean doesn't return, the executives will cancel the show. Russ trusts that Anna can carry the show without Dean, and Hope agrees. Russ shoots Anna in the kitchen on the first day and sees Anna's nerves getting the best of her. Anna convinces the production team that on-location is best for her.<br/><br/>Anna starts to get close to Lucas during filming, and Russ can see it through his lens. Anna had a crush on Russ in the past and asked him out. However, he turned her down, but they continue to be friends today. As Anna walks a razor's edge between her feelings for Russ in the past and for Lucas now, can Anna handle Dean returning? What will Anna do with the three leading men in her life?<br/><br/>Unlike most Hallmark movies, this love triangle feels plausible. The audience will wonder who she will choose or if either man deserves her. Anna and Lucas share a passion for food and culture. The intensity between Anna and Russ still exists. Let's not forget that Anna worries about losing her job if and when Dean returns to the show. Anna has a lot of stress in a beautiful location. Her lavender rack of lamb will fill her table, but her journey of self-discovery will fill your heart.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Her Fiancé's Double Life",
  "review":"Darcy and her family will meet her sister's fiancé, Thomas, for the first time this weekend. Kristina, the family housekeeper, sees Darcy sitting outside in her car. Kristina coaxes Darcy out of her car with a lollipop. Darcy walks up to the front door but hears the unfamiliar sound of laughing coming from the backyard. Her family is chatting with Thomas and having a good time. However, something about Thomas doesn't sit well with Darcy. She asks her friend, Marta, to do an in-depth search. Marta couldn't locate Thomas, but she found a man matching his description with two dead wives. The man disappeared after the life insurance paid him. Darcy worries this man is Thomas, but can she get her family to believe her before it's too late?<br/><br/>First, Darcy's family starts off toxic. They believe she is jealous of her sister, Brea, and Douglas snaps at her every chance he gets. Second, Thomas talks too much, especially during the killing. However, he does give Darcy his motive for coming after Brea and killing his other two wives. And Lindsay Hartley got the Drew Barrymore treatment for this movie. So, Lifetimers shouldn't get too attached. While this movie feels like an old-school Lifetime drama, it falls short. Hopefully, part two will be better.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
