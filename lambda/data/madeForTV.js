    "review":"When they were little girls, Laurie and Phoebe loved going to Candy Cane Lane.  The street was decorated from house to house with lights, food stations, and Santa. Now, adults Laurie and Phoebe own a flower shop and volunteer for Candy Cane Lane.  Mrs. McGraw comes to the shop and asks Phoebe to take a walk with her.  Mrs. McGraw has decided to move to California to be with her son. Candy Cane Lane is over.  Phoebe's face falls with the saddening news because she looks forward to the tradition every year.  When Laurie doesn't have the same reaction, Phoebe's confused.  Laurie wants Phoebe to try to change and create new Christmas traditions and date again.  Phoebe promises to try new things, but not dating.  Then as she closes the shop, Phoebe hears a knock on the door.  It's Eric, and he has a Christmas emergency.  He needs to buy a poinsettia for his special lady.  Phoebe assumes it's his girlfriend and gives him the plant.  Phoebe is wrong. It will take a few more run-ins for Eric and Phoebe to get their love story right, and Candy Cane Lane is the key.<br/><br/>This movie didn't capture the spirit of the holidays or the attention of the viewer.  There is little to no funny, heartfelt, or inspiring moments to put you in the Christmas spirit.  The viewer will become bored with the overdone plot and lackluster couple. The only watchable moment is with spunky aunt Maggie. You can skip this film this holiday.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Crafty Christmas Romance",
    "review":"Mandy owns a craft shop, and Gabby is her only employee. During the holiday season, Mandy runs a book and toy drive. Mandy looks through the box and finds an old edition of A Christmas Carol.  She flips through the pages and finds a letter to Santa.  In the letter, a little girl named Judith tells Santa that she lost her father in the war.  She found a coin her father would have liked and asked Santa to give the proof coin to her father.  Moved by the letter, Mandy decides to find the owner and return the Christmas letter and the proof coin.  She searches for the donator at a church and finds Jonah. He offers to ask the pastor and tells Mandy to leave her number.  Later, Jonah goes to Mandy's shop and tells her he got no luck from asking the pastor, but he wants to help her.  It's a good thing she got his help because she wants to give the owner the letter and coin for Christmas, just two weeks away.  And the biggest prize is the coin. Mandy took it to a dealer, and the dealer relayed it's a proof coin.  That particular proof coin is worth $30,000.  Mandy wants to make sure it is returned with Jonah by her side.<br/><br/>With a misleading title, the mystery of Judith is the focal point of this story.  While some believe Mandy should keep or sell the coin, she states her case and holds to her beliefs.  The proof coin doesn't belong to her.  She will do everything to find the owner or the owner's closest kin, and she will do it before Christmas.  Because the love story is the subplot, it's believable to the viewer. This love story is a Christmas time mystery and an instant classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Deliver by Christmas",
    "review":"Molly owns a bakery on the rise but uses post-it notes to track her orders.  Josh is a widowed father of one who wants to focus on work and his son, Charlie.  However, his sister-in-law, Amy, wants to set him up with one of her single friends.  He promptly says no, but he offers to help with the Christmas Lighting festivities.  She hands him a stack of papers of all the vendors and asks him to contact them all to confirm their orders.  After work, he starts sending emails and gets a response back from Molly.  She validates the cookie order, but her late-night response throws him. He asks to talk on the phone, and they have a great conversation, but they don't know they have met in the past.  While shopping for a Christmas tree, they accidentally held hands. They share a mutual attraction but choose not to act on it.  However, they continue to talk and text without knowing they are communicating with each other.  When Molly figures out the truth, will it be too late?<br/><br/>Deliver by Christmas is a romantic comedy with baking tips and a dash of Christmas thrown in. Some missed moments stem from missed opportunities, while others stem from a fear of rejection.  However, they both discuss how easy it is to talk or text. While we see the terrible effects of this in society today, this movie shows the good. While you know how the plot will end, this is a couple you will love.  By the way, Operations: Holiday for Heroes is real and can use your support.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Colonel Griff Carson is back from deployment for two months.  While on leave, the promotion board reviews his file for General.  He tells his wife, Janet, he is not sure he wants to re-enlist.  He is ready to retire and be home with his family 100%.  But Griff feels like a stranger in his own life. Seeing her husband is out of sorts, Janet drafts Griff into working at her bakery, Four Star Cupcakes.  With a big order for the mayor's daughter and preparing for the grand opening of her second bakery, Janet can use all the help she can get. By Friday, Griff has insulted customers, declared war with Ned's Bakery, and caused a flood.  In disbelief, Janet sees her dream crumble.  And to add insult to injury, Griff did a background check on her business partner, Thad, because he worries they may be having an affair.  Seeing the hurt in her eyes, Griff wants to fix things with Janet while deciding if he will re-enlist and take the promotion.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a revealing movie full of laughs and heart.  You will want a part two after the credits roll.  So many military families can relate to soldiers feeling out of step when they come home.  Adjusting to civilian life can be difficult.  The movie gets the message of family, trust, and love across without getting sappy or compromising the heart of the message. This film is a family movie everyone will love.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Pianist Margot is left reeling from a bad review and hopes to redeem herself at her next concert.  However, the show falls apart at the seams, and the fire marshal shuts it down.  With her concert canceled indefinitely, Margot decides to spend her Christmas with her family at The Chateau.  Adam runs The Chateau hotel, and the Christmas celebrations are legendary.  However, this year's Christmas celebration appears doomed. He has no concept, no musicians, and no singers for the Christmas concert.  Adam contacts his old college friend, Jackson.  Cellist and music theory teacher, Jackson can't believe the odds against him.  However, if he succeeds, the concert will make him a shoo-in for the committee chair promotion.  Then, he hears someone playing the piano and walks over to see who's the genius.  The musician turns, and she is a blast from his past.  Jackson and Margot dated in college and played in a band together.  But when Margot got a better opportunity to go solo, she took it, and their relationship ended. Adam has an idea, Margot and Jackson should play together at the concert.  Jackson and Margot try to assemble musicians for the concert.  They will have to heal two past hurts to pull off the best Christmas concert at The Chateau.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this movie is the music, the cute kid, and the other musicians.  You will be more invested in the secondary story of Sam and Sarah than the main characters. The script doesn't force you to care about his promotion or her review.  There is zero tension, even for a Hallmark movie.  This film won't be your favorite in the Countdown to Christmas series.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
