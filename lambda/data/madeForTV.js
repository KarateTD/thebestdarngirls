    "mtitle":"The Girl Who Escaped: The Kara Robinson Story",
    "review":"Kara Robinson spends the night with her friend, Jess, and makes plans to hang out with Jess and others at a lake house. Kara calls her mother, Debra, to update Debra on her weekend itinerary. Debra approves. Jess says they can leave, but her parents instruct her to water the plants before they go. Kara goes outside and starts caring for the plants with a water hose so Jess can shower. A man, Richard, gets out of a car with magazines and asks Kara if her parents are home. He grabs Kara's arm, puts a gun on Kara's neck, and tells Kara not to scream. Or Richard will kill her. He tells Kara to get into a container in the back of his car and keep quiet. After binding and gagging Kara, Richard takes her to his home and begins physically, sexually, and mentally torturing her.<br/><br/>Jess finishes her shower, gets dressed, and goes outside to check on Kara. Jess sees the water hose running but not Kara. She starts to panic and calls Debra. Debra goes to Jess's house and calls the police after calling Kara's boyfriend. The police officers write off Kara's disappearance as another runaway and tell Debra to wait by the phone for Kara's call. She prays for Kara's return, and so does Kara.<br/><br/>This movie takes you through every horrifying step Kara endured, including her kidnap, assault, and thought process. And she carefully plots her escape. Like Lisa McVey, Kara remembered everything around her to help make it and catch Richard. This movie shows that in her darkest hour, Kara plans to survive. Be prepared to scream at your TV because the police do nothing until Kara saves herself. This movie is a triumph that ensures no one will blame the victim. Kara is a survivor that brought peace to several families by waiting, escaping, and surviving.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Date with Deception",
    "review":"During a party, Diana mingles with the local councilperson as a blast from her past approaches her. Her ex-husband, Dr. Elias, greets Diana with a smile to mask his anger. Diana makes a quick exit and catches her breath inside her car. Elias knocks on the window and asks Diana why she is in town. Diana refuses to tell him because they are divorced. Elias warns Diana to stay out of his way and leave town. Diana screams in her car after Elias walks away.<br/><br/>Years ago, Elias used her to cover up medical fraud in his practice. She did her time in jail but can't get her nursing license without clearing her name. Until then, Diana opened a business that kept her in the healthcare industry. And she will use that business to implant spies in Elias's office and bring him down. But can she ruin his life without ending hers?<br/><br/>In the beginning, this movie gets viewers' attention with the classic LMN murder but finds a new stride afterward. Also, this film doesn't wait until the end to reveal Diana's accomplices. The plot interweaves it into prison flashbacks. Lifetimers don't know who to believe because everyone is lying. This new favorite will have you on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
