    "review":"Miles signs autographs for adoring fans after completing an in-store reading of his latest novel. His publisher begs Miles not to take time off to teach. Miles will teach a murder mystery writing class for bachelor students.<br/><br/>Ashley meets with her advisor about attending the lower-level writing class. He doesn't feel that it is appropriate because Ashley is a master's student who is close to completing her thesis, which is a novel. Miles is Ashley's favorite author, and she hopes to pick his brain about her book. Her advisor decides that Ashley should be Miles's teaching assistant. Ashley accepts the job.<br/><br/>Ashley and Miles meet before class. He demonstrates some of the aspects of writing and gives his students an assignment. He wants them to write the perfect murder. The students take this assignment with enthusiasm. But one person will take it too far and make someone's words a reality. Will Ashley be a victim, survivor, or perpetrator?<br/><br/>This movie has an overdone premise with compelling characters that make dumb decisions. The title gives away the film, and the twist is nonexistent. While the acting is well done, it can't help a dull script. Interestingly, a movie about writing a mystery doesn't have an enigma to solve.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sins of The Preacher's Wife",
    "review":"Beth and Dan move to Willowvale with their daughter to open Dan's practice. Dan found a home to Beth's specifications, but she's unhappy. She feels the woods are dangerous and thinks someone is watching her. Beth goes grocery shopping, and a man warns her to leave town. Beth tells Dan about the rude man and her panic attack after. Dan tells Beth to seek therapy.<br/><br/>Beth leaves the therapy session early and almost runs into traffic. Marion snatches Beth back in the nick of time. Marion is married to the town's preacher, Jim, and runs the church's daycare center. Marion senses something is bothering Beth and encourages Beth to open up. Marion is Beth's guiding light through Beth's career, marriage, and motherhood stresses. Beth is correct to be fearful. Someone is lurking in the dark, waiting to strike.<br/><br/>This plot is one of the most disjointed in Lifetime history. The opening 20 minutes introduces Beth as a whining nag to the audience. Beth's big trauma reveal has nothing to do with the overall story and feels like a waste of time. The writer should have written this plot from Marion's perspective to give the story more depth and entertainment value. Skip this movie.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vivian catches her friend, Kate, scrolling through the latest dating app. As they debate online dating, Kate matches with Walker and sets up a date. Kate meets Walker at a restaurant, and they have a stimulating conversation. Walker deals in antiquities and travels the world. Kate thinks the worldly man is the one, but she is tumbling down a dark rabbit hole of lies, money, and mayhem.<br/><br/>This plot will feel unbelievable. But if you watch true crime docu-series, you know it has happened. These love scams are well-documented in Bad Vegan, Tinder Swindler, and Love Fraud. The person has a wild story about their life. Something awful happens to them. And they desperately need money to get help. Gradually the money they need increases, the story gets more outlandish, and the victim falls deeper in love. Take this movie as a lesson about revealing too much information and multifactor authentication.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Make Me a Match",
    "review":"Vivi and Neela attend a company party. They reached 20 million subscribers for the Data Match app. She and her boyfriend, Kenny, are proud results of the app's match. Kenny steps away from Vivi during the party when his phone gets a text. She sees its flirty text from a woman hidden under his boss's name. She solely blames him and ends the relationship. She avoids embarrassment by taking two months off work.<br/><br/>Vivi returns to work to see that she and Kenny are still the face of the company. Vivi is determined to figure out what went wrong with her app. She and Neela talk to the analyst, and they say only 20% of their customers have long-lasting relationships. Neela suggests Vivi hate-watch Housewives reality TV. During a commercial break, they see an ad for Raina. She is an old-fashion matchmaker with a 95% success rate. Vivi gets an idea and contacts Raina for a face-to-face meeting. Raina enters Vivi's office, and her son, Bhumesh, follows moments later. Vivi wants to shadow Raina's tactics and incorporate them into the app. Bhumesh likes the plan. He wanted Raina to go digital for years. Raina agrees to the partnership but doesn't want Vivi to observe only. She wants Vivi to become a client. Vivi relents and starts the first step to finding the love of her life: Bhumesh.<br/><br/>This typical Hallmark plot has an old-school core. Raina states that her methods seem old but prove to have long-lasting results. Viewers may consider incorporating them into their dating lives. For instance, the families meet each other. Yes, they have chaperoned dates, but it halts the honeymoon phase to delve into questions about passions, hopes, and dreams as individuals and a couple. Vivi walks into Raina's world with an open mind, respect, and carefully-worded questions. This movie will be a staple this season.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Keyshia Cole: This is My Story",
    "review":"Keyshia Cole runs home after spending time with her boyfriend, Jamal, in 1997. Her adoptive mother, Yvonne, scolds Keyshia for being out with a boy while her adoptive father, Leon, keeps his distance. She sees money in Keyshia's hands and knows what Keyshia wants to do. Keyshia leaves under a veil of threats and looks for her mother, Frankie. Later, Keyshia finds her mother and takes her to dinner to ensure Frankie spends money on food, not drugs. Keyshia returns home, but Yvonne refuses to let Keyshia back inside.<br/><br/>After months of living with her sister, Neffe, Keyshia goes to a church and asks the congregation to pray for her career. Keyshia receives a check from the state for $14,000 and decides to use it to go to Los Angeles to pursue her dream. Keyshia looks for Frankie and begs Frankie to come with her. Frankie tells Keyshia to get settled first, then send for her. Keyshia heads to Los Angeles with a dream of recording an album. Keyshia's dream will come true, but she will suffer through family issues, reality tv, anxiety, and failed relationships.<br/><br/>This movie follows Keyshia through her struggles in Los Angeles. Each time she wanted to give up, something beautiful came her way. But nothing was easy. This movie needed another hour to focus on Keyshia and her career. Like her reality tv shows, the film's plot centered on the family. This story is as much about Frankie as it is about Keyshia. However, it helps viewers gain compassion for families coping with a loved one's addiction.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
