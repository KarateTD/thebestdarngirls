    "review":"David is bullied every day for his appearance.  His photography teacher, Jennifer, decides to give him a confidence boost after seeing him strike out with a girl.  Jennifer buys him new clothes, a facial, and a new hair cut.  She takes some pictures of him and sends them to a magazine.  David goes from zero to hero overnight at school.  The most popular girl, Brittany, asks him out.  Excited at his turn of events, David runs and tells Jennifer.  This was a huge mistake.  David doesn't know Jennifer is in love with him.  She will lie, photoshop, and kill to keep him.<br/><br/>Seeing this teacher's obsession with David is dark and disturbing.  The viewer is alerted to her sick nature at the beginning of the movie but you don't know why until the middle.  It's an intriguing watch but you need to see it from the beginning.  However, the answer to the final question is left up to your imagination.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
