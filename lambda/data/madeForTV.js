    "review":"Olivia drives her Aunt Theresa and Theresa's husband, Ian, to the docks for Theresa and Ian's cruise. Theresa pulls Olivia aside and informs Olivia that this isn't a pleasure cruise. Before Theresa elaborates, they have to board. Olivia waves goodbye to them.<br/><br/>Days later, Olivia gets a call from Ian. Theresa fell overboard during a storm, and the ship's officers can't find her. Soon, Olivia's fears come true. The police found Theresa's remains. When Ian arrives home, Olivia meets with Ian to check on him. He is understandably upset. She comforts him and gets in her car. Then, Shelly, a reporter, knocks on Olivia's window. Shelly asks to interview Olivia about Theresa's death. Disgusted, Olivia rolls up her window and drives away.<br/><br/>Olivia stands at Theresa's gravesite and mourns as Ellen approaches her. Ellen was Theresa's lawyer and now wants to talk to Olivia. Olivia goes to Ellen's office and learns Theresa tried to change her will before she died. This fact raises concerns for Olivia, but Ellen doesn't know how much Ian knew. Olivia plans to ask Ian later.<br/><br/>After talking to Ian, Olivia feels disturbed by his answers and demeanor. She decides to put her skills to work and investigate Theresa's death. Soon, someone sends Olivia death threats, stalks her, and attacks her. Can Olivia uncover what happened on the cruise before she loses her life?<br/><br/>This movie takes time to ramp up, but the body count rises exponentially. Unlike this review, viewers see everything happening on the boat before Theresa falls overboard. There was a drugging, an affair, and a violent storm. It was the perfect background for a devious death. The audience should give the plot a chance to play out. The movie has enough twists and turns to spark your interest.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Widow Erin visits her IVF clinic, and Dr. Jackson, a personal friend, puts her mind at ease. Jackson assures Erin that she will be a good mother and her baby boy is healthy. A few days later, Erin gives birth to Ben and breathes a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Now, Ben is four months old and can't stop crying. Erin grabs a thermometer, and Ben has a 102-degree temperature. Erin rushes him to the hospital. They run several tests and discover Ben has SCID, a genetic disorder. The pediatrician, Dr. Alice, says Ben needs a donor. She and her mother, Ruth, are Ben's only living relatives.<br/><br/>Erin gets the idea to have a local paper run Ben's story. They could raise awareness and find a donor. A reporter, Charlie, calls Erin and asks her to stop by for an interview. Later, Charlie tells Erin that her story sounds familiar to another family who used IVF at her clinic. Days later, Erin reads Charlie's article, an expos√© about Jackson and the clinic, and can't believe her eyes. Then, she gets a letter from the clinic threatening to sue her for defamation. She can't afford a legal battle, so she confronts Jackson at his office. Jackson offers a free DNA test to determine Ben's lineage. Erin hopes this will settle her concerns, but it will open Pandora's box.<br/><br/>This film gives My Child Has My Doctor's Face a body count using a similar plot. Jackson follows the advice of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer. He is a cunning villain who keeps you watching with a dutiful wife, Diana, by his side. Everything else is predictable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Ice Rink Murders",
    "review":"Megan got a scholarship to ice skate from Coach Diane. Megan meets Carly. Carly is a top-tier skater and a social media guru with sponsors. Her last partner, Brian, left her to skate with another competitor overseas. Now, Carly skates with her hockey player brother, Trevor. Fellow skater, Lyndsey walks past Megan with a warning to stay out of her way. Lyndsey got injured, and now Megan is there to fill in until Lyndsey is ready to compete. Carly introduces Megan to their equipment manager, Blaze. Megan prepares to become a champion, but someone wants her out of the way. And they will resort to murder to get the job done.<br/><br/>Don't let the title fool you because the body count is low. The viewer doesn't need to pay attention to understand what's happening, and the killer is evident to experienced Lifetimers. The film picks up when the culprit delivers their monologue, and a friend exposes it in real time. If you skip this story, you won't miss much.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Scarlett cracked the code for the perfect healthy puppy treat. She runs to her friend's store for marketing assistance. Her friend, business partner Gina, owns and operates Chew-That boutique. Scarlett needs Gina to create a logo and campaign so Scarlett can market her treats to local pet stores.<br/><br/>Gina created a campaign after her puppies demolished the treats. She named the treats Puppy Palate. Scarlett and Gina go to pet stores around town, but none have space for a new product with zero sales history. Also, they all carry Pup Chuck treats. Then, they remembered another store that opened last year called Paws and Wellness Emporium. They leave to meet with the general manager, Alex.<br/><br/>Before Alex says no, Scarlett suggests Alex try the Puppie Palate treat on his dog. He does and orders 100 boxes. Scarlett rashly agrees to make them by tomorrow.<br/><br/>Scarlett makes the order in time, and it sells out quickly. Alex asks her for a date, and she assumes it's business only. But Gina can see the attraction. Alex tells Scarlett he will ask the regional manager, Michelle, to hear Scarlett's pitch. Scarlett thinks they have a future outside of work.<br/><br/>Alex sits with Michelle, his ex-girlfriend, and discusses Puppy Palate. She hopes he is there to rekindle their relationship, but he is 100% professional. He pitches the idea, but Michelle doesn't think that the new product can repeat its success. However, she will consider it.<br/><br/>At Pup Chuck, the director of sales Paul wants a way to fatten the margin. Paul learns his sales are down at the Paws and Wellness Emporium and meets with Michelle. When he discovers Michelle is allowing a branch to carry a second brand, he threatens to pull his products from their shelves. Michelle calls Alex and tells him to end Scarlett's deal. Crestfallen, Michelle ends her relationship with Alex. Can Alex save his business and personal relationship with Scarlett without losing his store?<br/><br/>This dog lovers movie is cute and has an adorable ending with a 4-legged judge. The plot, as the title, depends on your love of puppies to keep viewers invested. Otherwise, it's the romantic comedy we all know. Scarlett and Alex's moment of triumph feels like a Leverage plot and makes the movie fun. Otherwise, save this movie for a rainy day with your pup.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
