    "review": "Kendra moved to be with Ben and Ben's son, Miles, after Ben's divorce settlement forced Ben to live in North Carolina. Ben and Kendra plan to move after Miles graduates high school. While Ben praises Kendra for her efforts, Kendra feels like she's floundering, and it causes her work to suffer. She wants to connect with Miles and start a family with Ben. Ben eases her fears and proposes to his long-time love.<br/><br/>Kendra meets with her gynecologist, who delivers sad news. Kendra's miscarriage caused detrimental scarring in her uterus. Kendra has very little chance of conceiving a child. She fears Ben will cancel the wedding if she can't give him a baby.<br/><br/>Ben's boss asks Ben to be the 2nd chair on a high-profile case. They want to make Ben a partner in the law firm, and winning this case will put Ben on the fast track. Later, Ben and Kendra eat dinner with his family and discuss their wedding. Ben leaves the table and finds his brother, Calvin, drinking scotch. Ben worries because scotch could affect Calvin's medication. Calvin admits he stopped taking them. As secrets grow, Ben experiences panic attacks. However, he doesn't tell Kendra because he fears judgment. Can Ben and Kendra make it to the altar, or will their secrets kill their relationship?<br/><br/>This film carries the burden of displaying mental health in African American men but does it with care and understanding. Society assumes that privilege can hinder mental struggles. Ben and Calvin prove that to be untrue. Mary J. Blige's upbeat party anthem inspired this movie, but it has an important message about mental health among African American men. It's not as good as the last two films. But it's entertaining. This last installment needs a part four to secure a happy ending for everyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Family's Killer Affairs",
    "review": "Nikki's fertility clinic calls her because they need her to come to their office immediately. A former employee was on his deathbed and admitted that he made a mistake with Nikki's IVF. He implanted her and her husband's fertilized egg into another woman. The woman, Gabi, gave birth to a girl, Jenell. Gabi and her husband, Matthew, raised Jenell. The clinic informed Matthew and Jenell of their grave error, and now they want to meet Nikki.<br/><br/>Nikki sits her daughter, Erica, down and explains the situation. Nikki and Erica meet Matthew, his sister, Kelsey, and Jenell at a restaurant. Nikki lost her husband in a car accident. A burglar murdered Gabi in their garage, and the police never found the suspect. During their conversation, Jenell excuses herself from the table. In a reflection, Erica sees Jenell arguing with a guy. She leaves the table after she sees the guy, Thomas, force Jenell out the back door.<br/><br/>Erica creeps in the shadows while listening to Jenell and Thomas's conversation. He wants Jenell to rekindle their romance, but it's over for her. He reminds Jenell that he provided her alibi for her mother's murder. Jenell contests that Matthew paid Thomas handsomely for that cover story. Erica runs back to the table as Jenell storms away from Thomas.<br/><br/>Erica tells Nikki about the conversation that Erica overheard between Thomas and Jenell. Nikki thinks Erica is reaching. Erica tells her best friend, JJ, but he believes Erica misunderstood the situation. Erica uncovers Thomas's page and sends him a friend request. He accepts Erica's request and offers information for $500. Erica will reveal the truth about her sister before it destroys her mother.<br/><br/>This movie has two bratty young women uncovering the truth behind the lies. While Erica is suspicious of Jenell, everyone in Jenell's family acts shady. Before the movie ends, Gabi won't be the last victim. The plot makes you question everyone, but the IVF story is there as a misdirection more than a plot point. This film is fun to watch but requires your attention because it displays text messages on the screen without the characters reading them out loud.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Killer is Calling",
    "review": "Faye, a 911 operator, helps trainee Jake take calls before leaving to spend time with her family. Faye arrives home to her daughter, Alex, and husband, Chris. Chris is on medical leave because he injured his leg trucking. His nurse, Stella, helps Chris get around. During game night, Faye gets a call from work. Everyone got food poisoning, and now Jake is alone. Faye knows Jake doesn't have the training to handle the calls alone. She leaves her family to work the late shift.<br/><br/>Faye tells Jake he can go, but he stays to help. Then, Faye gets a disturbing call. Someone is breaking into a woman's home. The scared woman calls and asks for help. The police enter the home and find two deceased people, but they can't find the woman. The woman continues to cry, but her tone changes. The woman is now a man. And he threatens to kill more people if Faye doesn't help him escape. He wants Faye to suffer like she made him do. She doesn't know why the caller wants revenge. Can Faye unmask the caller before he kills again?<br/><br/>This movie's plot has elements of Saw, Scream, and The Call. It ramps up the audience's anxiety but brings them back to earth with idiotic mistakes. The most intelligent person in the film is behind bars. Now, viewers should pay attention to smaller stories in the background. They become important later. This movie is entertaining and a little scary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Girl in the Garage: The Laura Cowan Story",
    "review": "Laura Cowan gathered the courage to leave Cleveland and move to Los Angeles. After gaining a more lucrative position, Laura plans to find a new place to live. First, she will write everything down as a letter to God. Laura ventures around the area and stops to hear a man, Shabazz, preaching about helping the community. Laura starts dating Shabazz after meeting him and learning about his hopes and dreams. Four months later, he takes Laura to a storefront. Shabazz purchased it and wants to start a life with her. He proposes, and she says yes.<br/><br/>Laura and Shabazz have two children, Ahmed and Maryum, nine years later, and a successful bookstore. She continues to write letters to God, informing him about her life. Laura notices strange men hanging around the store, but Shabazz insists they are businessmen. A few days later, ATF arrests Shabazz for gun trafficking.<br/><br/>Laura loses the store and boxes books to return to the publishers. Then, Musa Muhammed enters the establishment. He is a friend of Shabazz's and speaks to Shabazz regularly. Musa promised Shabazz he would help Laura in any capacity.

She and her children will suffer years of abuse and torture before they escape. Luckily, the pen is mightier than the sword.<br/><br/>This movie is a hard pill to swallow. Laura thought she could trust Musa because he practiced the same religion as her husband and was caring. Her relationship with Shabazz grew quickly, and he was loving towards her. She assumed Musa's friendship was the same. Laura doesn't see Musa for who he is until he turns on her children. Viewers must remember this story happened decades ago. Survivors didn't have an in-depth understanding of the different types of abuse. Laura outsmarted Musa by using the tools at her disposal. Her story is complex, but continue watching to see her shine and survive.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
