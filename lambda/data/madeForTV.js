    "review":"Heaven, Logan, and Fannie's children are 18 and ready to tackle the world.  Annie dreams about going to Farthinggale manor but Heaven shuts her down without explanation.  After a night of drinking, Logan crashes the car killing heaven and himself.  But Annie is still alive.  When Annie wakes up, she can't feel her legs, her parents are dead, and her step great-grandfather, Tony, is standing over her.  Tony offers to take care of her while she recovers and she accepts. Annie has no idea the dark secrets the manor holds.<br/><br/>Knowing the truth of Luke and Annie's kinship makes the longing glances and near kisses palatable.  However, the overall plot feels like a lack-luster Misery.  It just doesn't command your attention like the predecessors.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
