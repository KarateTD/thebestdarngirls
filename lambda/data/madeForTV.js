    "review":"While working, John eyes a new neighbor moving into the home across the street and walks over to introduce himself.  The neighbor, Alice, sees his wedding ring and asks John about his wife.  John tells Alice that his wife, Sarah, died six months ago.  While it's been an emotional time for him, it's been rougher on his two daughters, Chelsea and Sophie.  He relies on Sarah's best friend, Jillian, to help him with his girls.  After John fixes a water mishap in Alice's home, she thanks him by offering to cook dinner. They have a great dinner, and he invites Alice over to meet the girls.  Sophie is cordial, but Chelsea makes a quick exit to meet up with her boyfriend, Derrick, and her best friend, Rose.  After meeting with them, Chelsea senses Derrick is cheating on her.  With a confidence boost from Jillian, Chelsea confronts Derrick, and he admits to sleeping with Rose. Later, Chelsea runs to the hospital because someone attacked Rose and stole Rose's wallet.  The police think it was a simple mugging, but Rose doesn't believe that's true.  Rose remembers the attacker was a woman with dark brown hair, just like Alice. Determined, Chelsea will unveil Alice as Rose's attacker and get Alice out of her father's life for good.<br/><br/>Now Lifetimers, you better make sure to pay attention to the small details.  The attacker will unveil themselves in small mannerisms and their tone.  This plotline adds a nice twist but follows the same movie clichés with bratty teens, dumb cops, and love gone wrong stories. Before the twist, you will lose interest and stop paying attention.  So, give the first and last 30 minutes your full attention.  The rest is background noise.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Since Shelby didn't know much about her late father's family, her boyfriend, Luke, bought her a DNA kit on her father's birthday. Her results are back, and she can't wait to show Luke.  But it's Shelby that's in for the biggest surprise.  The results show Shelby that she has a half-sister named Rose on her father's side.  Her father, Alan, never mentioned having any other children, which leaves Shelby hurt and confused. Shelby, an award-winning chef, goes to the diner where Rose works as a waitress.  Rose explains that her father was always in and out of her life. When Rose's mother, Thora, got sick, Rose had to dropout of high school and work two jobs to support them.  Shelby matches the timelines and realizes that Alan stopped coming because her mother died. After the sisters meet, they want to spend more time getting to know each other. A week later, Shelby visits Rose and Thora's home.  They eat, drink, and play cards.  Shelby leaves, but a man attacks her.  When Shelby reports the crime, the detective tells her she is in danger because the attacker didn't attempt to take anything.  So, the attacker was after her.  Shelby has panic attacks and stops focusing on work and home. Who is the attacker, and why is he after Shelby?<br/><br/>This movie feels like the typical Lifetime movie, but give it a shot.  Yes, it has the parking lot attacker and the food allergy, but viewers get two intriguing plot twists.  Within the first hour, you don't know who to trust. This movie is a fun watch for a day that you need to kill 2 hours.  But it is not a must-see.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jillian's boss told her she was out of the running for a promotion. Without start-up experience, they will not promote Jillian to partner. As she fumes, Jillian's assistant, Sam, walks in with sad information.  Jillian's uncle, Robert, died.  And, much to Jillian's surprise, he left her his cabin. So she picks up the phone and calls the executor's number.  A man picks up the phone and says that he will be power of attorney for 40%.  Jillian knows this is outrageous and hangs up the phone. Once in town, Jillian meets up with her aunt, Marjory, and her other uncle, Walrus.  Marjory welcomes Jillian with open arms. After meeting the townspeople, Marjory asks Liam to drive her and Jillian to the cabin.  When Jillian sees it, she sees dollar signs.  She only wants to sell it.  However, Marjory explains that Jillian is a co-owner along with Liam.  She remembers Liam as the 40% man on the phone.  And Liam has plans in mind too.  He wants to turn the cabin into a B and B, but Jillian won't budge because she is a majority owner. After getting zero takers, Jillian calls Sam, and Sam tells Jillian that they are picking someone else unless she starts a start-up.  Jillian concludes to make the B and B her start-up.  Liam is delighted, but how long will it last when he finds out Jillian's company wants to take it over and keep it for themselves.  Can Jillian change their minds before she loses the cabin and Liam?<br/><br/>While the story is well-written, it doesn't hold your attention. The most compelling character is Uncle Walrus.  Each time the cabin needs a fix or an upgrade, Walrus is the man with everything they need. Jillian takes the time to get to know him and everything he can do.  These short moments draw your attention, not the attended love story.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
