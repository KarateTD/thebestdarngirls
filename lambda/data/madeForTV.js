    "mtitle":"Love Marry Kill",
    "review":"Forensic Pathologist Jordan says her goodbyes to her former lover and current friend, Thomas, and gets interrupted by a phone call from her friend, Tamera. Sadly, a hit-and-run driver killed their friend, Elisha. Jordan leaves DC and returns to Louisiana for the funeral. Jordan and Tamera talk at the repast and notice Brenda Harrington, Elisha's mother-in-law, exiting with Chief Lewellyn. Then they spot Elisha's husband, Dr. Miles. Tamera tells Jordan that Miles was working in the emergency room when the ambulance brought Elisha to the hospital. Jordan plays Tamera the last voicemail from Elisha because Jordan hears the worry in Elisha's voice. In the distance, Jordan sees her ex-boyfriend, Marcus, taking pictures of the attendees.<br/><br/>Jordan goes to her old job and brings the coroner, Dr. Sully, beignets. Jordan asks to see Elisha's autopsy reports and spies ligature marks on Elisha's neck but quickly returns the images when she hears someone enter the room. She turns to see Marcus standing there with a badge on his hip. They flirt before Sully walks into the room and gives Marcus the folder. Outside, Jordan examines the folder's contents and observes a missing photo. It's the photo that proves someone strangled Elisha before she died.<br/><br/>Jordan wants to stay in town to uncover Elisha's killer but must return to DC for work. At lunch, Brenda asks Jordan to be the Queen of her Grand Boul√©. Since the ball is in a few days, Jordan will use the time to investigate what happened to Elisha. She will unveil an affair, corruption, gangs, and a psychopath.<br/><br/>Viewers must be patient because this film requires set-up, but it's worth it. Every person in Jordan's life is a suspect because they all have underhanded dealings. Now, viewers will uncover one mystery within the first half. But don't give up on this plot yet. Because finding Elisha's killer is the tipping point to a larger storyline. The writers left an ending with series potential. So, keep your fingers crossed for part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sophie can hear her mother, Emilia, arguing on the phone as she walks through the door. The inspector found new issues with Emilia's spa that will delay her grand opening by months if she can't fix it on time. Emilia doesn't have the money because her husband left medical debt after he died. Sophie tells her mother that she got into the literary residency in England. She needs money for room and board, and they won't extend the deadline for her. Sophie picks up a magazine and sees a flyer for a mother-daughter pageant. And the grand prize is $100,000. Sophie gets Emilia to enter.<br/><br/>A few weeks later, Emilia and Sophie make the final ten and attend a meet-and-greet with the other contestants. Darcy, Mia's mom, comes over and sparks a conversation. Mia brings Sophie to the winner's wall and shows her pictures of past winners of other contests. Lilliana is a legacy and on the wall because her grandmother, former-winner Rebecca, runs the pageant. As Faye welcome's everyone, Adeline bumps into the table, spilling her drink and knocking over purses. Darcy spots that drugs came out of Vivienne's handbag. Everyone stands in awe as Faye disqualifies Vivienne and Vivienne's mother, Patrice, from the pageant. Lilliana's mother, Adeline, is obsessed with winning. She will steal, manipulate, and kill to get to the top.<br/><br/>OMG. Adeline isn't just a nightmare. She is evil personified. You will hate and love this conniving mother from beginning to end. She blackmails her so-called friends, sleeps with a judge, and tries to gaslight and pimp Lilliana. Rebecca stays one step ahead of Adeline and condemns Adeline after catching her. It's easy to see how Adeline became a narcissist with no grip on reality while Lilliana became caring. This movie is old-school Lifetime, and you will love it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love in Zion National Park: A National Park Romance",
    "review":"Lauren is a curator at the Denver Museum of Natural History and examines their latest acquisition: 3 red clay vases. The museum's largest benefactor, Carissa Hollingston, left the vases to the museum in her will. Lauren classifies them as being from the Anasazi people. Carissa found them 70 years ago when touring Zion National Park. Lauren wants to authenticate the treasures and return them to the Anasazi after displaying the artifacts in the museum for a while. Grady Hollingston, Carissa's great-nephew, believes Carissa wasn't in her right mind when drafting her will and wants to contest it in court. He leaves and warns Lauren to return the vases or prepare to fight in court.<br/><br/>Lauren pulls Margot aside and believes she knows a way to beat Grady. After examining the markings on the vases, she realized they had the first, second, and fourth of the set. They are missing the third. Lauren wants to go to Zion National Park and find the third vase. They could claim the collection and work with the Anasazi nation to defeat Grady's greed. Margot approves the time off.<br/><br/>Lauren arrives at the ranger's station, and Milly offers Lauren a cabin key and guide. Lauren takes the key but rejects the assistance. After hiking the trails, Lauren gets lost and doesn't have cell reception. She hears someone in the distance and rejoices when she sees Ranger Adam Proudstar. He is Anasazi and helps Lauren find her way to the cabin. She explains that she is looking for the missing vase but nothing about Grady, the impending legal battle, or the museum's desire to borrow the collection. He inspects the markings and discerns three landmarks: The Mountain of Mystery, Tabernacle Dome, and Mount Kinesava. Luckily, Adam knows someone who can help: Kaya Proudstar. With Kaya's wisdom and Three Sisters Soup, Lauren and Adam are on a mission to find a lost Anasazi relic. But Grady discovered the truth and will stop at nothing to find the third vase to claim the set as his. Can Lauren and Adam beat Grady without exposing Lauren's secrets?<br/><br/>This sequel expresses a love for the park while respecting the Anasazi nation. Lauren understands that the museum should return the artifacts and not hold them hostage. However, she doesn't tell Adam the museum wants them for display, and that omission is her mistake. For Adam, Lauren and Grady are the antagonists. Adam's feeling of betrayal is understandable, and this topic of museum ownership causes debates today. It's commendable to see Hallmark handle this subject from every angle.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
