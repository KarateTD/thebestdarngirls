    "review":"Fifteen years after Kendra left Ben in her rearview mirror, she became a successful photographer with high-profile clients.

    "mtitle":"Pocket Dial Murder",
    "review":"Stacey picks up a phone call from her husband, Jeff, and hears a woman screaming on the other end. Then a gunshot. Filled with fear, Stacey contacts her sister, Joelle. Joelle tells Stacey to call the police, but Stacey doesn't believe that's wise. Stacey and Jeff's phones share locations. The killer could have Jeff's phone, check the call logs, and pinpoint her location. Joelle leaves work, contacts the police, and drives to Stacey's home.<br/><br/>Stacey sits with Joelle and Detective Munger to go over the pocket dial. As Detective Munger questions Stacey, Jeff walks into the kitchen. Jeff discovered his phone was gone when working late with his co-worker, Ellen. Stacey breathes a sigh of relief as Joelle gets a text from her husband, Alek. After Detective Munger leaves, Stacey questions Jeff's whereabouts. She thinks he is sleeping with Ellen because Jeff had an affair before. Jeff promises that he is faithful and wouldn't hurt Stacey again.<br/><br/>Over the coming days, Stacey fixates on the pocket dial and her safety. However, Detective Munger makes the most startling discovery: the body of Juliette Lane. They classify Juliette as a homicide victim and release her name to the public. Jeff and Stacey see the news report, and Jeff tells Stacey that he doesn't recognize her. But he is lying. Jeff knew and worked with Juliette. As the truth unfolds, Stacey could lose her marriage and life.<br/><br/>This film is a mystery for the viewers, but don't mistake Stacey for an amateur investigator. The police go on a wild goose chase because of Stacey. She is Lifetime's Inspector Gadget. Aside from Stacey's interference, the plot gives viewers plenty of suspects, motives, and offputting actions. If you focus on the story, you will discover the killer has two reasons to commit the crime.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Julia looks for work after breaking up with her boyfriend, Drew. Her friend, Celia, wants to have a girls' night to celebrate the end of her relationship and her return to the dating world. At the party, Julia meets Celia's other friend, Alana. They converse about charcuterie boards, making friends as adults, and failed relationships.<br/><br/>Julia gets a period reminder on her phone and takes a pregnancy test. It comes back positive. Julia goes to the OB GYN to confirm the results and discovers she's near the end of her first trimester. Julia has to pay hundreds of dollars because she doesn't have insurance. She decides to keep the baby but ponders how to pay for it. Drew is happy to become a dad but doesn't have a job either. Julia attends yoga to relax, but Alana is there instead of Celia. Julia reveals her pregnancy and money problems to Alana. Later, Alana devises a plan. They will sell positive pregnancy tests. At first, it's easy money. But the game turns dangerous.<br/><br/>Can we get a vote that everybody sucks? No one in this movie wants to take responsibility for their choices. Drew may be childish, but at least he owns his actions. However, everything else will have you throwing things at the screen. Skip this movie unless you want to hate-watch something.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Copy editor Kelsey gave herself ten years to become a feature writer. She has one month left to fulfill that promise. So she came up with a list of article ideas and will later give them to her boss, Max, the editor-in-chief. Before their meeting, Kelsey walks and gets a smoothie to relax her nerves. A dog jumps on Kelsey, knocks her down, and spills the drink all over her work shirt. A man, Carter, pulls the dog off Kelsey and apologizes. Her meeting with Max is soon, so she returns to the office without exchanging names with Carter. Before meeting with Max, Kelsey borrows a scarf from her friend, Molly, to cover the stain. Molly tells Kelsey the meeting will go well because, according to the Star Stories app, her stars align with her moon.<br/><br/>Kelsey presents a long list of ideas to Max, but he rejects them all because they aren't original. She makes a quip about the app being incorrect. Max perks up and asks Kelsey to explain. She presents an idea about giving a skeptic's view of Star Stories and interviewing the creator, Carter. The creator never talks to reporters. Max loves the idea and tells her to write 1000 words by Monday. Molly looks up Carter online and discovers he will return to his hometown for a Meteor Festival. Kelsey bumps into Carter again at the elevators, but they don't exchange names again.<br/><br/>They arrive and meet the B and B's proprietors, Brian and Joan. Kelsey immediately asks if they know Carter. They exchange a knowing glance and laugh. Carter is their son. Carter enters the room and calls their third encounter fate. She tells him about the article and her 10-year plan, but he is apprehensive about the interview. Years ago, an ex-girlfriend wrote a scathing expos√© that almost ruined the app's launch. Will Kelsey convince Carter to do the article while falling in love with him?<br/><br/>This movie has some sweet moments, but it's far too predictable. You don't care about the characters enough to wonder about their past or future. The storyline's saving grace is the information about astrology. If you want to kill two hours or briefly learn about astrology, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't waste the spot on your DVR.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ilana and her boyfriend, Mike, finish their work responsibilities before going to Greece for Mike's sister's wedding. Ilana expresses concern to her mother, Susie, while maintaining a calm demeanor for Mike. Ilana is nervous about meeting Mike's family for the first time, especially his mother, Athena. Athena wants Mike and Ilana to get engaged, but Ilana thinks it's too soon because she and Mike have only dated for a year and a half.<br/><br/>Ilana and Mike arrive at Athena's hotel, Canaves Oia. Mike takes Ilana to a quiet romantic place, and she alerts him his shoelace is undone. He kneels to tie it, and Athena emerges from her hiding spot to congratulate them. Horrified, Mike whispers to Athena that he hasn't asked yet. With no recourse, Mike proposes to Ilana, and she accepts. Athena wastes no time imposing her will with little pushback from Mike. However, Ilana won't easily relent. As Ilana battles Athena, it stirs discourse between Mike and Ilana. They never discuss their future beyond dating. Can their engagement handle their differing career paths and personal outlooks?<br/><br/>Be ready to say 'the audacity' when watching this comedic, heart-warming gem. Ilana and Athena don't realize they are different sides of the same coin. They love their jobs, deeply connect with family, and love Mike. They must compromise to find happiness. The script carefully tries to not make Athena the villain. She says the wrong thing, but it's for tradition and love. This movie will be a genuine classic and leave fans hopeful for a part two.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
