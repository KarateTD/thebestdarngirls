    "mtitle":"How to Murder Your Husband: The Nancy Brophy Story",
    "review":"Nancy Brophy is an aspiring romance-suspense novelist and married to chef Daniel. He teaches at Oregan Culinary Institute and loves to cook delicious dishes at home. Her friends tell Nancy that her first chapter is bold and an improvement, but they find issues with her story. And publishers echo their statement with one rejection letter after another. When Nancy second-guesses her dream, Daniel tries to appease her, but it doesn't work. She reveals they are on a financial cliff, but he isn't concerned.<br/><br/>Nancy goes to their friend, insurance actuary Joe, to get a loan against their life insurance policy. Joe advises Nancy that this is a bad idea that could do more harm financially than help. He offers Nancy a job in sales, but she says no. She asks Daniel to get a job as a private chef for a tech billionaire. Instead, he offers to take a senior center job to compensate for their shortfall. Nancy hugs her husband and dreams of having a new house, a published book, and a trip to Portugal. When Daniel's second job doesn't fill the deficit, Nancy takes the sales job and starts to plot a way to get out without Daniel.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Nancy is full of envy, greed, and pride. She envies her brother, Mark, who makes a good living as a lawyer, but he has cancer. Nancy spends to appear wealthy and never wants to work to make more money. She never sees her shortcoming in life and her writings. This shortsighted behavior is her downfall. Daniel was a great husband that loved Nancy, cooked, and appreciated her passion. He didn't deserve to die. Nancy is an entitled narcissist that gets what she deserves in the end. The actors are terrific and connect viewers to the characters, but Nancy's past needs more attention.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"My Sister's Serial Killer Boyfriend",
    "review":"Local news investigator Maddie presents her editor, Rachel, with a potential new story. She looked into three murders and discovered the women had similar features. Maddie believes the killer will strike again in their town. Rachel doesn't think Maddie has enough evidence for a story and tells Maddie to focus on her current tasks.<br/><br/>Maddie's sister, Olivia, calls Maddie because someone broke into Olivia's home and attempted to attack her. Olivia wants security bars on her window, but Todd refuses because she is behind on the rent. Maddie offers to pay, but Maddie feels it's not enough and offers to let Olivia move in with her. Olivia agrees, but only if Maddie doesn't spy on her. Maddie reluctantly obliges. Later, Maddie thinks they should take self-defense classes.<br/><br/>Olivia has an instant attraction to their instructor, Haden, and exchanges numbers after the first class. Maddie keeps an eye on him, but she meets strange men on an app for random hookups. This choice is a mistake because the killer is watching their every move. The murderer wants to make Maddie or Olivia the next target.<br/><br/>Maddie is the human embodiment of 'do as I say, not as I do.' The movie tries to make the killer's identity a mystery, but it's too obvious. And the protagonists' glaring mistakes will make you lose sympathy for their characters. Lifetimers should put this movie on the back burner for a rainy day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Family History Mysteries: Buried Past",
    "review":"Sophie is a forensic genealogist who finds long-lost loved ones with her business partner, Esme. Sophie grabs a box of mementos from her bookshelf and contemplates opening a package from her deceased mother. Her adoptive mother packaged items from Sophie's biological mother with a note. Sophie gets a text message from her best friend, Jonathan, while looking at the package. Jonathan lets Sophie know he is on the way with food.<br/><br/>Sophie lovingly scolds Jonathan for being late, and they eat. Jonathan informs Sophie that his leukemia is back and he needs a bone marrow transplant. He hopes his mother, Dorothy, and fraternal twin, Jackson, will be a match.<br/><br/>Sophie arrives at the hospital to see Jackson finishing his test. Sophie and Jackson take a walk and talk about Jonathan's prognosis. Jackson is an EMT, so he knows he and Dorothy have a 25% chance of being a match. Dorothy hopes it will be Jackson.<br/><br/>Later, Sophie sees Dorothy on the street, and Dorothy asks to talk to Sophie. Dorothy worries that she and Jackson won't be a match and that an immediate family member is the best option. The only other family member is the twin's father, Clark. And Dorothy wants Sophie to find him. Sophie doesn't understand because Clark died before Dorothy gave birth. Dorothy tells Sophie the police never found his body, only his car in the water after it fell off the bridge. She implores Dorothy to tell her family as soon as possible so she can do a thorough investigation. Looking into Dorothy's family secrets to save Jonathan's life will bring Sophie closer to Jackson and herself.<br/><br/>Based on A Family History Mystery series by Brynn Bonner, this movie gives the ups and downs of discovering family history. The writers give the sons realistic views on finding the truth about Clark. Movies often gloss over the heartbreak in genealogical searches, but this plot unapologetically delves into each emotion. This film is a terrific starting point for H.M.M.'s new series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Reba McEntire's The Hammer",
    "review":"Judge Kim Wheeler is the traveling judge that presides over three courthouses in a 2500-square-mile radius in Nevada. The state added her latest district after a madam, Chris, found the judge, Jacob, dead in her brothel.<br/><br/>Kim spills coffee on her first day on the bench and asks her bailiff, Vicky, to clean it up. While it's highly irregular for a judge to start proceedings without a bailiff, Kim does it anyway. However, Kim proves to be strong enough to protect herself. A man attempts to attack Kim on the stand, and she hits him with her gavel. Someone captures the moment on camera, and it goes viral. Commenters nickname Kim 'The Hammer.' Before Kim leaves, her assistant, Jo, tells Kim that a case was left off her docket for Kirk Crawford. Kirk ran his best friend off the road because he dated Kirk's ex-girlfriend, and the friend died in the crash. Since the court is 126 miles away, Vicky and Kim will drive to town and sleep there.<br/><br/>Kim goes to the bar the night before the trial, and Kirk's dad, Bart Crawford, approaches her like a friendly snake while the bartender, Vance, watches. Kim tells Bart their interaction is improper and could affect the proceedings. Bart leaves with a tip of his hat as Vicky enters. Vicky gets a call that Jacob didn't have a heart attack. He died of a forced overdose. Later, Kim finds a note on her passenger seat with a dangerous warning. Someone wants Kim gone, like Jacob.<br/><br/>This movie has sex, drugs, and rock and roll. It's a funny mystery with dynamic characters that viewers will sink their teeth into while watching. Each character has a rich and complex backstory that resonates off the screen. With this small-town dynamic and tough-as-nails judge, this film is a series in the making. It's definitely worth a permanent place on your DVR. Be ready to find your new guilty pleasure. And to Lifetime: Make another ASAP.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
