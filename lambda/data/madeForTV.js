    "review":"Two years ago, Jackson won a state Senate seat.  Before he starts campaigning again, he and girlfriend Aubrey are going on a vacation to Bermuda.  For Aubrey, this is a babymoon. At dinner, Aubrey brings up the subject of meeting his mom but Jackson isn't ready. The next morning, they sit poolside and Aubrey starts to feel ill.  She tells Jackson to stay while she lays down in the room.  Hours later, she wakes up to find Jackson is still gone.  She tries to text him, call him, and look for him.  But no luck. Finally, she calls the police and files a missing person's report. Out of the blue, Aubrey gets an email for Jackson.  He has left Bermuda and gone home.  He felt like they are moving too fast and he wants some space.  Aubrey is devastated and the police call off the search.  But something doesn't sit right with Aubrey. Aubrey goes to the lobby to get more information and a woman introduces herself.  Her name is Rose and she is Jackson's mother. Rose believes Jackson is with the woman he truly loves.  Only one name comes to Aubrey's mind: Samantha. She will make deals with the devil to find Jackson and get out of hell.<br/><br/>You have to give your full attention to this movie.  It has flashbacks within flashbacks. And keep your eye on the bottom left side of your screen to get the date of the flashbacks.  This will make the twist much more revealing.  With Jackson's letter, a bloody bathroom floor, and an ex-girlfriend, you get a fun mystery of what happened to Jackson.  Soon, you will start questioning Aubrey. And in case you are wondering, The Bermuda Indenture and The Expectant Father are real books (FTC Affiliate Disclaimer).  In films like this, a change of characters' appearances will help with the flashback.  So stick with this movie for a good climax and a strong payoff at the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Diane is a hard-working lawyer and wants the promotion to partner.  But Russell tells her hard work isn't enough.  She needs to become a more visible presence at the firm's events.  When her boss, Garrett, invites her to wine tasting, she says yes. Her husband died 2 years ago and she cringes at the thought of sympathetic looks at the party when she comes alone.  Her sister, Laurie, tells her about the Companionship Collective.  You can hire someone to accompany you to events without it being a date. She is captivated by Miles and picks him. Diana meets Miles at a coffee shop and they have a great conversation.  She tells him about the wine tasting and he agrees to go.  Before they leave she tries to take a picture of him and he quickly shuts her down.  He says it's against the rules to have the employee's pictures on social media.  Diane apologizes and later meets him at the wine tasting.  Miles impresses all of her co-workers except for Kyle.  Kyle is eyeing the same promotion and will do anything to undermine Diane. When she hires Miles again, he starts to stalk her.  He vows to make Diane his, at any cost.<br/><br/>Not much to see here as Diane makes every possible Lifetime mistake.  She forgets to keep her distance, look into his background, and listen to her conscious about Miles.  Even as the truth stares at her from a computer screen, she ignores it and continues to see Miles off the books.  With each mistake, you feel less compassion. This movie can be skipped now and you can watch it during a \"Psycho\" marathon.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tanya wakes up in a hospital bed with one question on her mind, \"Where's Jake\".  Her nurse informs her that Jake, the co-pilot, died in the plane crash.  Miraculously, she, the pilot survived.  Years later, Tanya is a flight instructor. One student introduces himself as Jake Sherman.  Tanya believes her Jake has come back to her and she starts to fixate on him.  She uses this time to get to know him better.  Jake tells Tanya his wife, Annie, and his mother-in-law, Margaret, are against him learning to fly. Tanya starts to flirt and they kiss.  Jake stops and says he can't, he is a married man. She decides Jake is hers.  She will flirt, manipulate, and kill to have Jake all to herself.<br/><br/>Wow! Tanya takes nuts to a whole new level.  She is a mix of Seven with Throw Momma From the Train and a bit of Basic Instinct.  Your heart will skip a beat when she takes Annie and Jake for a flight.  However, you will experience mixed emotions for Margaret's inflight instructions. And you must watch it for yourself to enjoy the skilled writing and forethought that went into this script.  This movie has a great resolution.  Although, there could be a part two with some creative writing.  This is a fun and adult watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Freelance photographer Gina needs to find another source of income or she will lose her mother's home.  She decides to rent out a room online. After searching through applicants' profiles, she lands on Mark.  Mark is a pilot, a veteran, and has a green thumb. Gina accepts his application.  The next day, he moves in and makes an Irish breakfast.  During breakfast, she asks him to model for her portfolio.  While modeling, Gina tells Mark she has written emails to different agencies but has yet to send them. With just a few seconds of encouragement, Gina presses send.  After the modeling and life coach session, Mark hears Gina arguing with her ex-boyfriend, Levon. When he refused to pay her all the money she was owed, she took the photos.  Now, he is ready to play and pay.  Hearing Gina's distress over Levon angers Mark.  Mark has decided to protect Gina and her dreams at all costs.<br/><br/>Lifetimers, we have a shovel!!! And it comes early in the movie too.  Mark is sweet in the beginning, but Gina never checked his references.  So you know something bad will happen. It's just strange to see it happen so fast.  After 1 day with Gina, he is obsessed.  And it's nothing she does for him or to him, it's everything he does for her. You would expect the obsession to go the other way around.  This movie gives the viewers a good dish of crazy but no real cause for the obsession.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
