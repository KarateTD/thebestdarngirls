    "review":"The local newscaster interviews Abby for a segment about the hurricane warning.  Abby tells the newscaster that if the storm gets bad, she will go where her patients go. She is a day nurse for a comatose patient named Hannah.  Hannah's sister, Ms. Banks, hired Abby and Tony to give Hannah round-the-clock care.  As Ms. Banks tries to admonish Tony for his reading choices, they all get a weather alert on their phones.  The hurricane warning changed to a hurricane watch, and it will be a category three hurricane. Ms. Banks refuses to leave, so they decide to ride the storm out.  Abby goes into town for food and supplies for the generator.  As she packs the car, a man startles her.  Abby recognizes him from TV.  He is Dr. Carl, a TV storm chaser. Abby doesn't know that Dr. Carl is a deranged man that uses hurricanes to cover up murders. He thinks Abby looks like his late wife, and he hopes Abby will be smart enough to leave before he comes to Ms. Banks's door looking for survivors to kill.<br/><br/>Kudos for a high body count! This film will satisfy your bloodlust because each segment offers a fresh kill.  These writers pulled classic horror scenes and dynamic scores to make your heartbeat just a bit faster.  If having a killer in the house isn't enough, they have the doom of an unconscious patient relying on a generator to live. Surprisingly, Lifetime didn't save this movie for Halloween.  If you like a fun thriller with a sprinkle of gore, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
