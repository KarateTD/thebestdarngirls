    "mtitle":"Hoax: The Kidnapping of Sherri Papini",
    "review":"Keith Papini returned from his Geek Squad job at Best Buy to find his home empty. He expected his wife, Sherri, and their two children to be there. Keith uses the Find My Phone feature and tracks Sherri's phone to a patch of grass on the side of the road. Keith calls the police immediately. The cops believe the scene looks odd but investigate Sherri's disappearance as a kidnapping while keeping a close eye on Keith.<br/><br/>For weeks, Keith pleaded on news outlets for Sherri's safe return and vowed to stop at nothing to find her. Keith even took a lie detector test to prove he wasn't a suspect. On Thanksgiving day, a driver found Sherri screaming on the side of the road with a chain around her waist and hands. Sherri has bruises from head to toe, a broken nose, and a brand on her back. Sherri tells the officers that two Hispanic women kidnapped, beat, and humiliated her. Sherri wants to put it all behind her. But the police are determined to find the culprits to ease community tension. The truth is more horrific than the crime.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, Sherri Papini lied to gain freedom, attention, and money, with a bit of bigotry added for good measure. While the movie covers the case quickly, the lies happened for years before the judge convicted Sherri. She wasted valuable resources and cast a shadow of doubt on all victims. The movie itself is well-acted and doesn't try to excuse what she did. However, it explains why she did it and her lying history. This film will stay with its viewers while disgusting them.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"My Daughter's Deadly Roommates",
    "review":"Aubrey isn't excited about her first day at Southern District University because she can't live on campus. Aubrey's mother, Charlotte, says Aubrey's dad didn't come up with his half for living expenses.<br/><br/>A girl from Gamma Gamma Gamma stops Aubrey on the way to class and asks Aubrey to come to their mixer. Aubrey can't afford greek life, so she rejects the offer and finishes her day at her job in the bookstore.<br/><br/>Carter approaches Aubrey and recognizes her from campus. Carter asks if Aubrey ever considered a non-Greek, unsanctioned club. Carter is with a group called The Kinship. They are like a sorority with no dues. She invites Aubrey to come to her house to learn more about The Kinship.<br/><br/>Aubrey comes to Carter's home but hesitates at the door with another hopeful, Elle. Elle and Aubrey make fast friends and enter Carter's home together. Member Sable takes away Aubrey's and Carter's phones before the party. The girls danced, laughed, and drank for most of the night. Then they sit and ask Aubrey and Elle to share secrets. Elle admits to using drugs to fit in at her old school. Aubrey confesses to having an affair with a married teacher. Carter and her friends are secretly recording the confessions for blackmail. The Kinship is a cult and will use the BITE model to control, alienate, and kill its members for their leader. Will Aubrey get out alive?<br/><br/>This movie covers mind control very quickly, but it follows the formula for most cults. Aubrey doesn't know, but Carter and Sable watched her from afar. Once they realized Aubrey was a loner, they singled Aubrey out for their group. It's easy for viewers to yell at Aubrey. But remember, she is naive and desperate to make friends. The final fight scenes are laughable, and the dialog drags, but this movie has some teachable moments to redeem itself.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Plot to Kill My Mother",
    "review":"Elena comes home to smell her mother's delicious food cooking on the stove. Elena wants to know why her mother, Teresa, is packing, but Teresa wants a moment to gather her thoughts before she explains. She tells Elena that she is leaving early morning to see Elena's grandmother, Sophia, in the hospital. For years, Teresa made Elena believe that Sophie had died. Teresa explains she lied to Elena to protect Elena from her past.<br/><br/>Elena watches Teresa leave in the morning and talk to a man, Grant. A few days later, Grant knocks on Elena's door with heartbreaking news. Someone murdered Teresa, and Elena's life is in danger. Teresa was in witness protection before Elena's birth because Teresa testified against Elena's father, Lorenzo, and his violent associates. Grant promised Teresa he would keep Elena safe. So he wants to give Elena a new identity and immediately move her. Elena refuses because she wants to find the person who killed her mom. She pushes Grant out of the door and looks through her mom's things. She finds the name of Teresa's old friend, Jackie, and calls her. Jackie invites Elena to visit anytime. This invitation gives Elena an idea. She can go to Teresa's old hometown and investigate Teresa's murder. Elena will uncover the evil within Teresa's dark past.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie feels typical as Elena makes one horrible mistake after another. Each time, Grant has to rescue her. When the plot focuses on the mystery, this film improves. The motive for Teresa's death, however, is common. If you get past the first hour, the enigma will hold you. But the conclusion falls flat.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Clue to Love",
    "review":"Audrey's boss, Dennis, comes to her desk with a story. A small, family-owned paper won a Pulitzer Prize for an article written by the owner's son, Morgan. Dennis wants Audrey to go to Hope Cove and shadow Morgan to find out what makes him and the newspaper, The Hope Cove Beacon, so unique. He will give Audrey a highly-coveted promotion with a raise if she writes a good article.<br/><br/>Audrey walks into an editorial meeting, and Morgan, the soon-to-be editor-in-chief, mistakes Audrey for a delivery person. Morgan's father, soon-to-be-retired editor-in-chief Clifton, corrects his son and invites Audrey to sit and attend the meeting. She listens to the stories, and one catches her attention. Greg has a story about Ask Aunt Hope. The paper has an anonymous advice columnist who answers the town's letters from an old fashion drop mailbox. No one knows who Aunt Hope is, but she sends her responses in time to make the paper. Audrey wants to work on the article while shadowing Morgan.<br/><br/>Clifton takes a phone call from Mitchell. Mitchell wants to absorb the Beacon into their media conglomerate. Morgan tells Clifton not to sell without adding some contingencies to the contract. Clifton mulls over the idea and asks Mitchell to give him some more time. However, no one knows that Michelle and Audrey's boss, Dennis, is the same person. He sent Audrey to spy on the paper without informing her. As Morgan and Audrey work together and learn from each other, will Dennis Mitchell's devious plan to take over destroy their budding romance?<br/><br/>This movie is slow, and the leads have zero chemistry. Viewers watch to see who is behind Ask Aunt Hope, and it's the only reason to keep watching. The story of Aunt Hope is loving and heart-warming, but everything else in this movie drags.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Wedding Veil Journey",
    "review":"Nick works all night at the restaurant, while Tracy works in the daytime. Tracy talks to Avery and Emma about missing Nick, and they remind Tracy that she never had a honeymoon. So Nick and Tracy spin a globe and, after several tries, land on Rhodes, Greece.<br/><br/>They arrived in Rhodes a day late because their plane got delayed. So they beg the concierge, Elizabeth, for any available rooms tonight. Pen overhears their conversation and calls Tessa, who runs Casita Casita Lindos with her brother Xander and has a vacancy. Nick and Tracy take an unforgettable ride to the hotel and go to their room. Tracy unpacks the veil to let it air out. Tracy sits outside to read The Great Gatsby, and Leo offers to draw Tracy a picture. Nick and Tracy meet for a lunch date but can't bare to swallow Xander's food. They feign compliments and leave for the market. They see Leo sneak through a window of a local school after saying goodbye.<br/><br/>Tracy wakes up alone and deduces Nick is in the kitchen fixing Xander's marinara sauce. Tracy is upset because Nick is working on their honeymoon. Tracy calls Emma and Avery to vent, and they lovingly call her a hypocrite because they know she's handled business calls from Stanley. She forgives Nick and tries to be more understanding.<br/><br/>Xander moves Tracy and Nick's things to the honeymoon suite, but Xander forgets the veil. Tracy tells Tess, and they sprint to retrieve it. Before Tess can knock, Colin Dalton comes out with the garment in hand, and they bump into each other. Tracy thankfully gathers the veil and tells everyone about its origin.<br/><br/>Leo gives Tracy a gift, and she repays Leo with new art supplies. Headmaster Papadopoulos sees Leo with the present and assumes he stole them. He confronts Tracy about the gift because it gives Leo false hope about his ability to use art to make a living. Tracy and Nick learn that Leo is an orphan residing at the school. Leo has an idea. Leo follows Emma online and wants her to look at an artifact the school found. If the school gets donations from the artwork, it could help Papadopoulos see the value in art. Tracy promises to try for Leo. While Tracy fulfills her promise, the veil sprinkles its magic on Tess and Colin.<br/><br/>Inspired by There Goes the Bride by Lori Wilde and the 6th movie in The Wedding Veil series, this plot gives another honest view into marriage. Nick and Tracy love their work, but it leaves little time for romance. On their honeymoon, they still can't escape the office but for different reasons. Tracy is the defacto boss, but Nick is losing his passion. And we can never forget the veil's magic because it strikes two couples this time. This storyline gives Tracy's character the most growth and makes viewers misty-eyed.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
