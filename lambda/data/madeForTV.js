    "mtitle":"Single Black Female 2: Simone's Revenge",
    "review":"After watching her home burn down with Simone inside two years ago, Monica moves to Seattle with her best friend, Bebe, for a new job at Red Alert News. Bebe will be a hairdresser on set.<br/><br/>Monica and Bebe meet their new boss, Kendyl, and are immediately off-put by Kendyl's cold demeanor. Later, Bebe works on Monica's hair when the makeup artist, Layla, enters the dressing room. Monica tries to make small talk with Layla, but Layla isn't interested.<br/><br/>Monica sits at the anchor desk, and Kendyl takes her notecards away. Monica gracefully handles the change until Monica reads her life story to the audience. Monica regroups on air, interviews her guest, and finishes the segment. She can't escape her nightmares and feels Simone around her even though Simone is dead.<br/><br/>In Texas, Sister Grace wishes she could remember her past but is grateful Sister Margaret saved her after she collapsed on the side of the road years ago. Grace works in a thrift store when she sees Monica talking about her stalker on the news. The report causes Grace's memories to flood back. She remembers her name is Simone and rages about Monica's report, slandering her name. Margaret encourages Simone to find the truth. She doesn't know that truth is deadly. Simone is out for revenge and won't stop until she gets it.<br/><br/>This sequel to Single Black Female ramps up the crazy quickly. Simone gets her memory back in the first 30 minutes and goes on a revenge rampage. Everything she does is slow and deliberate. Also, Monica isn't dealing with her psychological trauma from the attack. She has nightmares and sees Simone, but her fear is understandable. As a warning, it does take a while for the body count to start. But it quickly rises. And the ending will leave you ready for part 3.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Lonely Crime Fanatic",
    "review":"Ashley has another nightmare about her estranged husband, Paul, after listening to a crime podcast before going to bed. Her friend, Lily, warns Ashley that Ashley focuses on podcasts to avoid her divorce. When Ashley states she's heard them all, Lily mentions the Unsolved Files podcast starring David Bryant. Then, Paul uses his key to get inside the house. She pushes him out and declares she will only communicate with him through a lawyer.<br/><br/>Ashley researches David online and learns he has a book signing. She finds David talking to fans outside the store, and David politely corrects Ashley for fawning about his work. He wants her to remember that the podcast's subjects are real people. Then, he signs her book with his phone number and invites her to dinner. During dinner, David offers to show Ashley his studio and get her started in podcasting. Ashley believes this is the start of something beautiful. It will be a beautiful disaster.<br/><br/>This movie drags to an abrupt stop that you will beg for. No matter how much Lily tries to warn Ashley, Ashley keeps falling for distractions. And Ashley's final revelation feels like a critique on true crime podcasts, their listeners, and their subjects. It's a bit preachy for the wild setup. This film is a bore and, hopefully, the worst entry for the Wicked Revenge 2024 season.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

It will transport the viewer to a complex but romantic time. The script brings delight and pain to gossip and makes the viewers beg for more. This movie proves that Jane Austen's words transcend era, nationality, and ethnicity. It will stay on your DVR and become a favorite.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After wrapping the last episode of her series, Crime Time, Hadley meets with her agent, Saunders. He hasn't been able to find more acting work for Hadley, but he negotiated a memoir deal for her. Hadley and her family will move to Mystic, Colorado. Hadley can visit her mother, Dee, in Mystic, Colorado while writing about her life and time on the show.<br/><br/>Hadley and her kids, Rain and Hendrix, drive to Mel's diner to meet with Hadley's real estate agent, Jay. They notice a man, Anson, posting missing flyers of his business partner, Sam Davis. Once inside, Hadley notices a man, Kirk, sitting at the bar with bruised knuckles while Mel serves him. Jay gushes over Hadley's accolades before taking her to the rental property.<br/><br/>Jay informs Hadley that the area is quiet and her closest neighbor, Frank, is miles away. Hadley tries to go to sleep but can't because of screaming and gunshots. Rain tells them the screaming is coming from Frank's goats, but she is unsure about the shots. Hadley calls the police. Detective Shawn Caden tells Hadley it's hunting season, and the mountains create an echo chamber.<br/><br/>Hadley leaves home to meet Dee at the diner and hears strange flapping. She finds a parachute on a tree with a dead jumper attached. The jumper is Sam. Shawn investigates, and the medical examiner makes a positive ID and declares the death a murder because Sam has a bullet wound. As Hadley updates Dee, Sam's mother, Steph, enters with a request. She wants Hadley to investigate the crime because Mystic police are short-staffed, and Hadley trained with actual officers. Hadley says yes and assembles her Clue Crew to help. They will look into Sam's life and use Hadley's expertise and hyperobservation skills to solve the crime, with Detective Shawn protecting and unknowingly guiding them.<br/><br/>This movie is an entertaining start to a new series. Hadley and her kids must learn about small-town life, a world of free parking, screaming goats, and no matcha martinis. The crime is intriguing and complex. But the wrap-up proves the clues were in front of the audience the whole time. Viewers will look forward to seeing these characters grow while solving more crimes as a Clue Crew.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
