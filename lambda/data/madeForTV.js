    "mtitle":"The Holiday Proposal Plan",
    "review":"Sonny's boss, Genevieve, comes bearing gifts, but Sonny knows Genevieve has something up her sleeve. Genevieve wants Sonny to write a story for her followers while she spends time with her father, Cliff, and stepmother, Paulette. Genevieve tells Sonny to look at her gift. It's a substantial check, so Sonny promises to create a topic.<br/><br/>Sonny sits as her best friend, Bree, enters her apartment with wine. Bree learned her boyfriend, Jarod, planned to propose. He booked a European vacation with romantic settings. But Bree had to cancel after her promotion. Now, Jarod wants to spend the holidays alone to ponder their relationship. Bree doesn't want to lose the love of her life. So, Bree and Sonny plan activities to entice him to get down on one knee. They can find European Christmas traditions that incorporate love. It can be a travel-from-home story. Sonny realizes she can use this for her article.<br/><br/>Genevieve gives Sonny the green light. Sonny runs home to tell Bree about the article, but Bree has a surprise for Sonny. Bree invited Jarod's best friend, Kip, to come with them. Unfortunately, Kip is Sonny's ex-boyfriend. He broke up with Sonny because she worked too much. Bree says Kip is the only person who can bring Jarod to Sonny's place without Jarod getting suspicious. So, Sonny agrees to let Kip come to their Christmas vacation at her parents' home. She hopes to avoid him and focus on her work. Of course, it won't be that easy. There are more deals to make, feelings to expose, and guests to arrive. Will their proposal plan work?<br/><br/>This movie has an interesting premise because it makes a plotline about what viewers argue the most about. The lead character has to give up their successful job for a man. The key to this movie is compromise, not surrendering. It has lulls in the script until Victor and Jonathan arrive. Their snark brings humor to an average film. This movie is great for a snowy day, but don't let it take up space on your DVR.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

She gets a new assignment in a ritzy part of town. His name is Patrick. He is a construction worker and needs someone to buy gifts for his crew, clients, and others.<br/><br/>Patrick's nephew, Bernard, hired her to help Patrick.

He wants her to buy work boots for his staff, and Bonnie must purchase gifts for Patrick's daughter's music teacher and his clients. She hears Patrick's request but decides to elevate his choices. Will going above and beyond go too far, or will it give Patrick the boost he needs?<br/><br/>Let's address the elephant in the room. Bonnie has a shopping addiction. Next, Patrick's demands are reasonable. While one gift hits the mark and gets Patrick a job, the other gives Patrick's crush the wrong idea.

    "mtitle":"My Killer Reunion",
    "review":"Claire prepares dinner for her family when her husband, Dr. James, returns from his rounds at the hospital. Dr. James must take extra rounds at the hospital and will be late for Claire's reunion. Claire has some information for James. Their daughter, Iris, brought her boyfriend, Simon, to visit. Claire pleads with James to be nice to Simon because Iris likes him. James puts a smile on his face and plays nice for Iris.<br/><br/>Iris admits to Simon that she's worried about her parents. Her father cheated with a nurse years ago. Claire left him and started dating another man, Victor. However, Claire dumped Victor and worked out her relationship with James.<br/><br/>Claire travels to the reunion with her best friend, Gina, who is Victor's business partner. Whitney greets them at the front door and walks Gina and Claire around the property. They meet their old friends, Morgan and Trevor, inside. Then, Victor walks into the room, and Claire excuses herself. Victor follows Claire and tries to kiss her, but Whitney finds them. Later, Claire leaves her bedroom and walks to the garage. She finds Victor dead with blood on his chest. She calls the police for help as James enters the garage. The police consider all the reunion attendees to be suspects. However, Whitney points her finger at Claire. Can Claire clear her name before the cops arrest her?<br/><br/>This movie tries to use misdirection to be compelling, but it doesn't spark viewers' interest. The killer's monologue goes by too fast while Claire interjects to fill in the gaps. So, why should you view this? It's all for the drama and the shade. These women aren't afraid to get dirty and go low. This film won't be a favorite but will kill two hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Felix grabs the church's petty cash and jumps in his car to pick up food from the grocery store. Felix's car breaks down in the snow, and he pushes it to Rocko's Diner.

Carla will go to work and pick up a pre-ordered black forest cake on her way home. Carla works as an in-home nurse for Nancy. Nancy demands Carla retrieve hand-crafted wood ornaments from the attic. Nancy marvels over them. Her daughter, Noël, created them by hand and marked them with the star of Bethlehem. Carla finds a folder with a young woman's photo and asks Nancy about it.

Imani finds Dan playing video games. He admits that he has nowhere to go for the holidays. They can't leave due to the snowstorm. And it will be an eye-opening blessing.<br/><br/>Based on Mickey Guyton's song 'Heaven Down Here,' this movie takes its time displaying the four main characters' backstories. So, don't give up on the plot because everything will come full circle. As the plot reveals their connection, your heart will swell with joy. This story is a beautiful standout this season.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
