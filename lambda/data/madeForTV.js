    "review": "Rachel arrives late to watch her son, Ethan, play hockey. Michelle updates Rachel while Diane comments on Ethan's tattered pads. Rachel apologizes. Diane tells Rachel not to worry because her son, Alex, loaned Ethan a pair of his old ones. Rachel thinks Diane's gesture is kind, but Michelle sees it as patronizing.<br/><br/>Diane corners Coach Mike about changes to the lineup, practice, and workouts. He listens but is too busy with the Riders to take it into consideration. Diane sees Rachel in the parking lot, struggling with her car, and stops. She reminds Rachel that Ethan is a reflection of the team. Diane will sabotage, blackmail, and injure to get Alex to the top when no one takes her seriously. Will Rachel be able to stop her?<br/><br/>This film has a touch of old-school Lifetime. The writers made Diane an unhinged woman who resorts to self-harm to help her son. The intro gives the viewer a glimpse into Diane's backstory, but you get more information later. The audience will sympathize with the sons. It's the final face-off that alters the film's dynamic. It becomes an impromptu counseling session. One swift move brings this film to reality. This picture is for old and new fans alike.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Marci surprises her family early with DNA kits for Christmas. She took the test and found a relative in New York who works as a dancer. Marci's mother, Caroline, asks if the woman's name is Helen. Stunned, Marci confirms. They knew about Helen but never spoke of her.<br/><br/>Marci calls Helen. They've been speaking for months, and Helen agreed to meet Marci in person. Helen assures Marci that she will be there. Helen ends the call and answers the door. Her friend, Dominic, left his scarf after her Christmas party. She assumes it's him. However, someone attacks her and leaves Helen for dead.<br/><br/>Marci works in Caroline's store because Caroline battles depression after losing her husband. Marci hasn't heard from Helen. Marci's friend, Tamra, believes Helen ghosted Marci. Tamra observes that Marci is upset, so she takes Marci to the bar to unwind. Nick approaches them with a badge. He explains the attack that left Helen in a coma. He warns Marci that the DNA test triggered the attacks. Nick tells Marci to alert anyone in her family who took one. The attacker has a list, and they are checking it twice. Can Marci uncover the culprit before she's next?<br/><br/>This film starts strong but wanes in the middle as Marci becomes sidelined with mundane personal issues. And the culprit's motive for attacking Marci and her family is a difference of perspective. Also, it's unbelievable that this small town kept this family's secrets from Marci. While the script is tantalizing, it can't overcome the lull in the middle. So keep this film in the background and watch when something good happens.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Erin closes her shipping store and gets dressed for her girlfriend's award ceremony. Kelly calls to make sure Erin will be there on time. Erin promises she won't be late. She hears the door chime, and she yells they're closed. Erin walks to the storefront and sees a baby in the stroller with a note. The note says his name is Nicholas, and his mother wants Erin and Kelly to raise him. Erin doesn't know what to do. So, she takes the baby to the ceremony.<br/><br/>Kelly looks around the room for Erin as they call her name for an award. She grabs the trophy, stands at the podium, and opens her mouth to speak. Then, she hears a baby's cries in the crowd. She's awestruck to see Erin holding a child. After the ceremony, Kelly and Erin call social services. The social worker, Betty, takes Nicholas and starts the process for emergency placement.<br/><br/>Kelly and Erin return home, but they miss Nicholas. They aren't sure if they can take care of him, but they don't want him to be alone on Christmas. They run to the CPS office and request to foster Nicholas until Betty can find a permanent placement. While Kelly plays detective to find Nicholas's mother, Erin considers adopting him. Their differing opinions will test their relationship, careers, and village. What will Erin and Kelly do?<br/><br/>Hallmark giving its audience a story about a baby during Christmas is genius. For years, Erin and Kelly were content with their family until this bundle of joy turned their world upside down. They rethink their home, job, and future. The writers ensured this wasn't an easy decision for the couple. With these heart-wrenching scenes, the plot had a funny mystery of finding the birth mom. Erin and Kelly's friend creates a Baby Board to track potential suspects. This mystery gives the film the mental break it needs from emotionally heavy topics. This picture is the standout of the season.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Christmas with The Knightlys",
    "review": "Georgia's boyfriend, Andrew, confesses that after their engagement, he wants her to quit her job and move to the city. Confused, Georgia can't imagine not helping her students in and after school. Andrew gives Georgia tickets to the Knightlys' Christmas Ball to distract her from their conversation. She looks at the ticket and realizes its the same day as her student's play. He states that the Knightlys are the richest and most influential family in town. She scoffs because she thinks they should do more to help with their wealth. She registers that they will never see eye to eye and ends the relationship.<br/><br/>Executive Secretary Brayden sees Chase Knightly enter. He hands Chase the latest tabloid. Brayden tells Chase his private antics will have a negative impact on Chase's father's merger deal. Chase doesn't care because his father, Barrington, doesn't respect Chase. Chase exits to his awaiting car, and Brayden and paparazzi Randall follow. Brayden and Chase enter the car while Randall follows. Brayden tells Chase he needs an image makeover for Barrington to take him seriously. Chase hates having Randall on his tail, so he sneaks into a community center to get away.<br/><br/>Georgia reviews the sets while she keeps an eye on Zoe. Andrew enters with his new fiancée, Megan. However, Chase can see she's faltering. He runs up behind her, says she's his girlfriend, and they exit the auditorium as the paparazzi runs inside. Georgia can't believe he just lied. Chase laughs and says she had nothing to stand on in her rundown school. She counters and states that he should be a better person. Brayden finds them and likes the idea of them together. Chase will pay Georgia to be his girlfriend and clean his image for Barrington. She will play the part if he builds a new community center. Chase agrees. He exits and introduces Georgia to the press as his new girlfriend. However, Randall refuses to believe it and will do anything to expose the truth. Can they keep up the lie when their feelings become real?<br/><br/>The premise of this film feels different because all the main characters know about the lie. The writers had them negotiate the deal like a contract, and it's amusing. Georgia and Jace are multi-layered and well-written characters. Barrington expects little from Jace, so he acts accordingly. Jace rises to Georgia's challenges. Seeing them with each other's family is comforting and rewarding. This film has something for everyone and is the best of UP TV's holiday programming.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Dylan and Kiara raise 4 beautiful kids. Their daughters, Sadie and Molly, want to follow their father's footsteps and work in the music business. Their sons, Zeke and Zane, are funny, caring, and intelligent. Dylan tells Kiara he's taking Molly to his band's gig tonight. He wants to give her experience in front of a crowd.<br/><br/>Later, Dylan slips into bed with glorious news. Molly sang for a packed house, and his band got a record deal. The downside is that they have to move to record the album. Molly is excited, but her siblings aren't.<br/><br/>As Dylan chases his dreams, Kiara returns to nursing to support the family. It's emotionally draining for her to be away from her children, but she knows it will pay off in the future. In December, the family gets devastating news. Molly died in an accident. Their family, music, and faith crumble. Can they get back on track as a family? Or will this tear them apart forever?<br/><br/>This film is a musical roller coaster. Very few holiday movies have the courage to tackle issues this painful. Your heart will break as Dylan drinks, yells, and loses focus on what matters the most. Don't be surprised if you yell at the screen. You will say a quiet prayer for this family. Don't worry if you aren't a fan of musicals. This movie has original songs, but they don't dominate the dialogue. Also, it's rooted in faith but doesn't alienate others. This entertaining and thought-provoking picture is for everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
