    "review":"Rob and Chloe plead their case to an adoption agency. After hearing their counselor's assessment, Chloe worries the agency will say no.  Then she gets the shock of her life, Rob is happy to hear it.  He is having second thoughts about having a baby.  She is dumbfounded and breaks off their 8-year relationship.  To get her mind off her heartbreak, Chloe finds her next job as a nanny.  She is hired by Emily and Michael to watch their son Tommy. They tell Emily that Tommy his homeschooled and can't go outside for security reasons. She agrees to their terms and moves into her room.  On her first day, she breaks the rules and takes Tommy outside.  When they come home, Tommy hears something in the basement and Chloe calls the police.  Emily comes upstairs and tells Chloe to relax, the sounds she heard were from her workroom.  While Chloe is calmed, Emily is upset Chloe called the police.   Emily explains her ex-boyfriend may have the police on his side.  It is not safe for her family as long as her ex-boyfriend is stalking her.  Chloe, with extreme confusion, agrees to their demands again.  After hearing about disappearing nannies, seeing well-drafted dossiers, and learning about a rock star stalker, Chloe will look for the truth and save Tommy.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Au Pair Nightmare, this movie redeems itself by having great actors, chilling moments, and a strong climax.  You will spend most of the movie yelling at the screen or looking for spilled tea. Emily consistently says she wants to keep her family together and safe.  And she will starve, confine, and interrogate Chloe to do it.  While there are a lot of similarities to the other movie, give this one a chance.  It will give you all the thrills and chills you need.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"EMT Lilly runs to get some food when she notices someone parked in an emergency spot.  She yells at the driver to move his car but he refuses.  When Jeff comes out, his car is being towed.  He can't believe Lilly reported him.  Jeff tells his house manager, Veronica about the \"goodie-goodie\" and she can see the spark in his eye.  The next day, Jeff's father, Rex, has an accident and Veronica calls the ambulance to help. The moment Lilly and Jeff see each other, all the bad feelings reemerge.  After Lilly and Nick clear Rex, Jeff decides to play nice and asks Lilly out.  She gives him the 'thanks but no thanks' line and Jeff's mouth is left on the floor. The next day, Lilly's boss comes to her office.  A benefactor was so impressed by the work they did, he donated a large sum of money to the hospital and was granted a tour.  It's Jeff.  Jeff convinces Lilly's boss to let him go on a ride-along in the ambulance. He doesn't understand that money is not the way to her heart.  Years ago, Lilly was applying to medical school and was #1 on the waitlist.  She was never admitted but #22 on the waitlist was accepted because his parents made a huge donation to the college.  Lilly detests anyone who uses their money to take shortcuts.  She sees Jeff as another entitled brat. But is she judging Jeff too quickly?<br/><br/>This movie gives you 3 loves stories for the price of one.  Rex is finding love again.  Lilly's roommate Megan is learning to trust her boyfriend Vince.  And Jeff is falling for Lilly.  While this movie has all the feels, it gives a strong lesson about Lilly's prejudice towards the rich. Megan is quick to point out her lack of compassion.  As Lilly gets to know Jeff, she sees the good in him.  She inspires him to be better and get involved with his heart, not just is money.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"I Was Lorena Bobbitt",
    "review":"Lorena drove down the Virginia streets with tears streaming down her face and blood on her hands.  Not being able to grasp the steering wheel properly, she saw something in her hands and threw it out the window. Lorena went to the home of her boss, Janet.  Janet saw Lorena's appearance and asked what happened.  Lorena commented, \"I think I hurt John\".  At the hospital, the police want to know what happened.  But not what happened to her.  What happened to John's penis.  While he slept, she cut it off and left the house with it. In months, John Bobbitt would be on trial for marital sexual assault, and Lorena would be on trial for malicious wounding.<br/><br/>As Lorena tells her story, she wants domestic violence victims to learn one thing: Silence is not an option.  Born in Ecuador and raised in Venezuela, Lorena had the dream of coming to America, owning a business, and starting a family.  At 18, she was swept off her feet by a young marine.  They got married and her dream became a nightmare. As the abuse got worse, Lorena learned there was little to no protection in the 80s and 90s for abuse victims. Lorena had police documentation, witnesses, and pictures but it still ended as a 'he said-she said' battle that made Lorena a punchline. While hard to watch, this movie covers a lot of tough topics that are still relevant today like abuse against immigrant spouses, military spouses, and young spouses.  You will see Lorena go from victim to survivor to citizen.  And with that, she created an organization to help others survive.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The town is abuzz with the library's upcoming Renaissance Night fundraiser for the new reading room.  The biggest draw is seeing Lester's Gift.  It is a headdress gifted to Queen Elizabeth by Lester who was head over heels in love with her.  Chief Lynn and Detective Arthur have set up CCTV cameras and go over procedures with security.  Before the headdress is displayed, Kelly Stevens, Detective Arthur, and Chief Lynn watch the security guard, Talbot, fix the headdress on the mannequin and close the curtain. When the curtain opens, the headdress is gone.  Aurora knows the thief must be in the room.  Her choices are Kelly, James, Eric, Howard, and Miya.  Kelly worked for the museum that lent the headdress for the fundraiser. James is on the museum board.  He believes art should be enjoyed and moved so others can see it. Eric, Aurora's latest attempt to set Sally up, is a Western Civilization professor and Nick's friend.  When he continues to lie by omission, Eric is on the list. Howard stepped onto the stage right before the headdress was revealed.  When his felonious past is unearthed, he is added to the suspect's list.  Miya is in the import export business.   Before anyone left the library's fundraiser, everyone was searched.  But Miya refused. As Aurora mentally prepares the list, she sees another suspect leaving.  The security guard Talbot.  She follows him to his hotel and finds him dead from a gunshot wound and no headdress.  This confirms Talbot was the thief but he had a partner.  Can she find the mastermind behind the plan?<br/><br/>Based on the Aurora Teagarden novels, you get a strong mystery that will have you guessing from start to finish.  Every one is shifty and keeps their secrets close.  With each secret, Aurora adds and removes names from her list.  Much to the detriment of her relationships.  She keeps her eyes so close on the case, she is missing the bigger picture.  Nick is ready to ask for her hand in marriage. Aurora fans will be getting their long-awaited proposal.  The well-written mystery is a stupendous bonus.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
