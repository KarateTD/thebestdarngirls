    "review":"Molly scours the internet for nannies but hasn't found one she's comfortable with. She talks to her therapist, Dr. Waldron, about her uneasiness. Dr. Waldron suggests Molly ask the women in her postpartum forum for available nannies.<br/><br/>Molly asks the support group for help, and one recommends Nicci. While Molly is eager to interview Nicci, Molly's husband, Noah, isn't so sure. However, he changes his mind during the interview. Noah convinces Molly to hire Nicci.<br/><br/>On Nicci's first day, Molly's friend, business partner Lindsay, drops by to say hello, deliver items, and meet the baby. Molly prepares Emma's bottle, but Nicci alerts Molly before giving it to Emma. Nicci fears Molly mixed up the baby formula with powdered grout. Noah grabs the bottle and tastes it. Nicci is right. Molly spirals into sadness. Later, Nicci warns Molly that Molly will have to pay for her hairdresser even if she doesn't go. Molly ignores her, so Nicci takes the appointment.<br/><br/>Noah returns home and kisses a woman on the couch holding Emma. He assumed it was Molly. But it's Nicci with Molly's haircut. Molly sees the haircut and worries that Nicci wants to take her life. As her mind starts to slip, can Molly make her friends and family see Nicci's dark side?<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance. It starts like an old Lifetime film with a mix of Single White Female and the Hand that Rocks the Cradle. However, there is more to the story. It has low-tech crimes mixed with micro-targeting. Molly's thoughts aren't reliable because she is hearing and seeing things. Also, every character has a sketchy past. As it flashes back, you will see moments you missed or overlooked. So, don't turn away from this movie too soon. It has a surprise in store for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cherie can't take her mother's interference anymore. After dance class, Cherie lets her mother, Renee, know the truth. Cherie wants to quit the dance team. Her mother explodes because the team will have college recruiters coming to the Classics Competition, and Cherie could get a full scholarship to a school of her choice. Then, Cherie drops another bomb. She is moving in with her father, Johnny. Cherie believes her mother is living vicariously through her because Renee got pregnant senior year.<br/><br/>As Cherie packs her things into Johnny's car, Renee takes Cherie's phone. Renee enters her empty house and screams in Cherie's old bedroom. Then, Cherie's phone rings. A college scout will be at the Classics Competition. If Cherie performs, then the college will give Cherie a scholarship. Renee enrolls in Lincoln High School as Cherie. She will pretend to be 18-year-old Cherie, join the dance team, and get the scholarship. She refuses to let her age or the law stop her from achieving glory.<br/><br/>This movie is bananas, and you will love every minute of it. The plot takes Never Been Kissed and turns it on its head. Renee reeks of desperation as she uses out-of-date slang to connect with the dance team. Her need to fit in and be Cherie will make you cringe. But that's a good thing. Renee is vile, awkward, and a groomer. It's hard to tell if she is jealous of, envious of, or secretly hates Cherie. Regardless, Renee is sick and the perfect Lifetime villain.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
