    "mtitle":"Imperfect High",
    "review":"After her mom got a new job in Chicago, Hanna feels like the odd-girl-out in her new school.  During her first day, Hanna attended a drug prevention seminar. In art class, Hanna gets two surprises.  First, the teacher will recommend his most promising students to apply for an art fellowship.  Second, Rob is her art partner for the next project. The next day, the school goes into lockdown, and Hanna has a panic attack.  Seeing Hanna panicking, Dylan starts to calm her down. Dylan introduces Hanna to his friends Blake and Rose.  The couple invites Hanna to a party.  At the party, Rose can see that Hanna is overwhelmed.  So, she offers Hanna a Xanax.  At first, Hanna hesitates, but she takes the pill. This one decision put Hanna on a slippery slope to addiction, overdose, and unprotected sex.  Can she climb out of the pill bottle in time?<br/><br/>With doctors writing so many prescriptions today, kids' access to dangerous narcotics is astounding. Even as Hanna learns about the dangers of quitting cold turkey, it doesn't stop her from snorting the drug.  If you watch Intervention, you understand that Hanna's story is a known tale.  An anxiety disorder mixed with social pressure and access to pills is a dangerous and often lethal combination.  As Hanna's addiction spirals out of control, the deadliest drug of choice is denial.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"My Husband's Secret Brother",
    "review":"Jackie makes substantial changes to her life since her husband, Jon, died three years ago.  She is opening a dance studio with her friend, Kat, having her boyfriend, Kevin, move in, and raising her teenage daughter, Madison. As Jackie's suspicions grow, Kevin pops the question. Jackie contacts a high school frenemy turned blogger, Maya, to interview Jackie and Kat for their upcoming business.  During the interview, Maya focuses on Jon and his death more than the studio.  A hit and run driver killed Jon, and the police never found the suspect. While this leaves Jackie heartbroken, it also makes her wealthy. Now, she has $150 million.  She is using some for her studio and living expenses.  However, the rest is for Madison's trust. Kevin, a plastic surgeon, doesn't care about the money.  Well, on the surface.  He wants the money for himself.  He wants to marry Jackie, kill Madison, and then kill Jackie. But Kevin feels like he deserves a cut of Jon's family fortune because, unknown to Jackie, Jon was his brother.<br/><br/>Talk about saved by the twist.  This movie starts as the stereotypical Lifetime movie with a widowed single mother moving too fast, a bratty teen, and a too eager boyfriend.  But it slowly changes the script. The plot sets this up at a critical time where Kevin is on a killing spree.  You think he found a new victim but oh no.  While this movie is a slow build to ordinary, the twist is its saving grace.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Karen",
    "review":"As Malik and Imani move into their new home, their neighbors, Karen and Jane, watch.  Karen quickly notices the couple is African American and becomes worried. In the morning, Imani sees Karen installing cameras that point directly at their home. Malik tells Imani to ignore it and focus on work.  The next day, Karen introduces herself to Malik but won't shake his hand because she is a germaphobe. Malik smiles, accepts, and goes home.  He hopes this is the last interaction he has with Karen.  But he is dead wrong.  Karen immediately reports him to the H.O.A. because she is the president.  However, they refuse to reprimand them because the couple is new. Karen's frustrations grow.  She wants Imani and Malik out of her neighborhood.  And if the H.O.A. won't help her, she will use her cameras, gun, and brother to force them out.<br/><br/>There was a time where movies like this seemed far-fetched.  But in a world with cell phone cameras, live streaming, and Fear Thy Neighbor, we all know this story is shockingly true.  The difference between the news and this movie is that it gives Karen and her brother a backstory. While this is a compelling movie, your blood will boil as Karen and her brother, Mike, repeat racist rhetoric and continue a campaign of harassment.  Regardless, the same lesson rings true.  Just mind your business.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Redemption in Cherry Springs",
    "review":"Melanie returned to Cherry Springs to sell her recently deceased mother's home.  Or at least that's what she is telling everybody.  Melanie is an investigative reporter in fear for her life. In Boston, she uncovered unsafe working conditions in the Fall River Factory. And when the story broke, dozens lost their jobs.  Not long after, Melanie started to receive death threats and moved.  In Cherry Springs, Melanie sees her Uncle Jay and her high school friends, Diana and Rachel.  Rachel's husband, Tony, is a mechanic and owns a body shop.  And Melanie sees Tony get into arguments with Rachel, his sister, Sara Jane, and his co-worker, Andy.  At a community center opening, Melanie meets the new detective, Jay, from New York.<br/><br/>On her daily run, Melanie notices the same white van following her.  She runs home to get away and finds Rachel in her front yard.  Rachel tells Melanie that Tony is missing.  They report Tony missing to Jay, and Jay finds Tony's car with skid marks and blown tires. When Melanie uses her investigative journalism skills to help Rachel, she reveals cancer, money, and a secret woman.<br/><br/>Based on a story by Lauren C. Snowden, this movie is a promising start to a series.  The plot introduces you to a lot of characters and their backstories in a short time. However, there is an overarching mystery.  Who is after Melanie? This question gives viewers more episodes and a love story to come.  The mystery was a bit predictable.  But now that we know the characters, the plots will have more time to evolve.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After seeing her daughter off to college, Maya is ready to focus on work.  Maya's assistant, Kate, greets Maya and goes over the day's events.  Maya has an important client meeting and a new intern starting today.  After a successful pitch, Maya waits for Kate to bring in the intern, Alex.  Maya thinks Alex has impressive credentials and promises to give him beneficial work.  While Maya thinks Alex is sweet, he rubs Kate the wrong way. Kate's concerns are valid.  Alex will poison, harm, and manipulate to win Maya's approval and affection.  Of course, Maya won't learn this until she and Alex cross a professional and personal line.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, viewers will watch Alex's unstable nature in high school.  It's no wonder that it carried over into his internships.  While the story develops slowly, the end does provide a few tense moments over a very disturbing dinner.  This movie doesn't require your full attention in the middle, just the beginning and the end.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
