    "mtitle": "Accused: The Karen Read Story",
    "review": "Karen Read wakes up in the middle of the night and notices her boyfriend, Officer John, isn't there. Karen wants to look for John, but her dad warns her to stay home. Then, she rings her friends, and they search the snowy roads for John. Karen finds John's body in an embankment covered in snow. She calls 9-1-1 for assistance.<br/><br/>The EMTs put John in an ambulance, but won't let Karen go with him. They escort her into another ambulance. Nurses take Karen's blood at the hospital as she begs for an update on John's status. Her father enters with horrible news. John passed away.<br/><br/>Karen returns to John's home, and his family is in the kitchen. They calmly ask her to pack and leave so they can care for John's children in their home. Later, the police interview Karen. She worries that she is a suspect after they take her car and phone. So, she gets a lawyer. Devastated, Karen doesn't know what's next. That's until her lawyer calls. The police believe she backed into John after a fight and left him to die. Karen hopes the police will understand that she did not end John's life, but she doesn't remember everything that happened because she was intoxicated. They dash her hopes when they change Karen's charge from manslaughter to 2nd degree murder. Will Karen spend her life in jail?<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, Karen Read's arrest exposed the dark side of the Boston Police Department. This film doesn't take sides. While it's not a linear story, it showed Karen's obsessive nature about their relationship. This movie also highlights the sexist nature of the police department. They didn't investigate the crime and took shortcuts. The trial is over, but the movie lets you decide if Karen was guilty or innocent. That's what makes it compelling.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Who killed Amanda?<br/><br/>This movie is a stellar mystery with a plethora of drama. The film introduces you to a warm and friendly church atmosphere. However, it doesn't take long to see something is lurking under the surface. This pacing captures your attention and keeps you on the edge of your seat. During the interrogations, the viewers see flashbacks. It allows you to see how anyone could be the culprit. This movie is a rousing start to the LMN 2026 season.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mama's Little Murderer",
    "review": "Constance returns to her quaint cabin in the woods. She calls out for her son, Anthony, and boyfriend, Leo. She spies a note on the dining room table and reads it. Someone kidnapped Anthony. Constance screams for Leo. Later, Mitch calls. He wants Constance to enter her bank and withdraw $100,000, and they will return Anthony safe and sound. Leo wants to inform law enforcement, but Constance says no. She will do anything for her son. Although Anthony hasn't been perfect over the last few months, Constance will fight for him. Can she get her son home safely?<br/><br/>This movie isn't linear. It alternates between today and days ago. This accomplishes two things. It keeps your interest in the film and offers clues about the bigger picture simultaneously. Constance lives in a tug-of-war that will irritate fans while compelling you to watch. As the script reveals the underhanded dealings, you will clutch your pearls and yell at the screen. The film's only downfall is that there are zero murders - absolutely none. The title is misleading. This movie is entertaining, but it raises your blood pressure.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sophia gently rattles a list of demands for her team as she enters the workplace. She is the CEO of Tierra Fashions and a proud dog mom to Gianni. Sophia hears from her assistant, Miranda, that a major stakeholder, Mario, needs to speak with her immediately. Mario wants to sell his shares of the company to a national chain. Sophia wants to meet with investors in Fiji to promote her new spring line to stop him. She booked a private jet and will leave in a few hours.<br/><br/>Max shops for ingredients at a local farmers' market when his friend, pilot Julian, calls him. Julian knows that Max dreams of running a restaurant, but fears of past mistakes hold Max back. Julian met with an investor in Fiji who wants to open a food establishment. Julian informed the investor about Max, a sous chef, and got a meeting. However, Max needs to leave now to catch the flight.<br/><br/>Max arrives at the hangar, and Julian hands him a flight attendant uniform. It was the only way Julian could clear Max for the flight. Sophia hired Julian to fly her to Fiji. As they travel with their co-pilot, Lance, Max will serve her and attend to her needs for free travel. During the flight, Julian warns everyone to take their seat. Hours later, Sophia wakes on a liferaft. The plane crashed, but she, Max, Lance, Julian, and Gianni were marooned on a deserted island. Julian reveals that the crash ruined the transponder, so no one is looking for them. While Julian and Lance brave the elements at sea, Max, Sophia, and Gianni must stay alive on the island. Can they return to civilization to save their careers?<br/><br/>This humorous film is charming and refreshing. Sophia and Max don't turn on each other. Instead, they come together and discover each other's strengths. This twist makes their love story believable. They deal with sunburn, pirates, and fashion faux pas. The setup is expertly done, the comedic timing is unmatched, and the chemistry is off the charts. This film is the perfect start to Hallmark's 2026 season.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Stolen Girl",
    "review": "Maureen cleans herself up after her father, Joe, spots Maureen's ex-husband's car in the driveway. She forgot it was Karim's day to pick up their daughter, Amina. Days later, Maureen purchases Joe's medication from a pharmacy and loses sight of Amina. She searches for the young child but can't find her. She contacts the police. Maureen alerts officers that Karim is a Syrian national. During their divorce, Karim threatened to take Amina to Syria. There is nothing they can do because Karim is a legal parent. Maureen screams and storms out of the station.<br/><br/>Years later, Maureen's community raises funds for her to travel to Washington, D.C. Maureen will ask lawmakers to help her find Amina and change the laws. They ignore her pleas. Robeson approaches her with an offer. He works in international child recovery. He needs a woman on the team for extractions. If she helps him find other missing kids, he will help her locate Amina. After some prodding, Maureen agrees to join his team. Will Maureen find Amina?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie combines high-octane action with lulls of dialogue. The actors deliver an amazing performance. They evoke fear and urgency as they save children around the world. The vanity team made them look tired and unkempt as they traveled covertly. While the action is compelling, it's the conclusion that will resonate with parents. This film is best for the small screen and finds the right home on Lifetime.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
