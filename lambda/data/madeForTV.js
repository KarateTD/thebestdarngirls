    "mtitle":"The Disappearance of Cari Farver",
    "review":"Liz and Dave met on a dating app. While Dave hoped for a good time, Liz wanted more. Dave is an auto mechanic, and a beautiful woman comes in with car trouble. Cari Farver attempts to impress Dave with her automotive knowledge but makes a mistake. Cari comes back to retrieve her computer, and Dave requests a date. Cari says yes.<br/><br/>On their first date, Cari tells Dave she has a son and a few bad breakups. Dave's ex-wife, Sarah, comes into the restaurant with their two kids. Cari goes to Dave's home for a nightcap, but Liz interrupts them. Cari decides to leave and cross paths with Liz outside the building's front. Liz offers to stay the night, but Dave turns her down.<br/><br/>After a date, Dave goes to Cari's home for fun, but her ex-boyfriend, James, comes over. Cari issued a restraining order, and James wants her to rescind it. Fearing for Cari's safety, Dave offers to let Cari stay at his place for a few days. They walk into Dave's home, and Cari gets comfortable, but Dave finds Liz's tablet. He takes it and returns it to Liz. When he turns to leave, Lis is naked, and they sleep together. Dave comes home and tells Cari the truth, but Cari surprises Dave by being understanding.<br/><br/>Then, Dave gets a message from Cari asking to move in with him. Dave replies no. Cari sends a slew of angry messages. Cari's mom, Nancy, gets a phone call from Cari's job because Cari hasn't come to work for two days. Cari texts Nancy about work, her life, and Sam. Then, Cari asks Nancy to watch Sam for a few days until Cari gets her life together. Nancy relents and reminds Cari that her cousin's wedding is in a few days.<br/><br/>Cari doesn't come to the wedding, so Nancy goes to the police. The police don't think much of Nancy's concern until she mentions the restraining order against James. For years, Cari will text Nancy and Sam to explain her absence but harasses Dave, Liz, Sarah, and all of Dave's ex-hookups. Before police uncover the truth, there will be threats, arson, and death.<br/><br/>Based on A Tangled Web by Leslie Rule, this story seems too crazy to be authentic, but it is a true story. This crime could only happen in today's timeline because it used technology to hide the truth. This film makes you ask yourself, 'How well do I know my family and friends' email and texting styles.' Pay attention and ask questions.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secrets at the Inn",
    "review":"Natalie is on cloud nine because she got the head chef promotion, but the cloud darkens with one phone call. Natalie's identical twin, Celia, died after falling down the stairs. Natalie returns to Falls Church to handle Celia's estate with Celia's friend, Sarah. Sarah is the executor of Celia's will and explains that Celia's daughter, Sabrina, is the beneficiary of everything, including the inn. However, Sabrina can't inherit anything because she is a minor. Natalie wants to sell the inn, but ABC holdings have a lien on the property. Sabrina demands to stay, but Natalie says no. Sabrina leaves in a rage with her boyfriend, Elijah. During an argument between the women, Andy approaches. He was Celia's handyman and worked tirelessly to get ready for guests. In the night, Natalie hears strange noises throughout the house. Natalie asks Andy to discover the origin, but Sabrina says Celia's ghost haunts the inn. With everyone holding a secret, who can Natalie trust?<br/><br/>Experienced Lifetimers can see more than meets the eye because everyone except Sarah is a liar. If you don't like seeing bratty teens on screen, skip this movie. The perpetrator and reason are typical for Lifetime. If you need a few hours to kill without dedicating all your attention, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Monster High: The Movie",
    "review":"Clawdeen is tired of feeling like an outsider in the human world. She is half-human and half-werewolf. Without her father's knowledge, Clawdeen enrolled in Monster High. Apollo agrees to drive Clawdeen to the secret entrance, but she must keep her half-blood heritage a secret.<br/><br/>Apollo drives Clawdeen to the middle of the woods, and a portal opens up for her. Clawdeen feels at home in her new school and meets her new dormmates: Frankie and Draculaura. Frankie is 15 days old. Frankie's parents made Frankie from the parts of intelligent dead people. Frankie is brilliant but doesn't know how to make friends. Draculaura is the daughter of the most famous alumni, Dracula. Draculaura wants to live up to Dracula's expectations, but she loves witchcraft. Monster High considers witchcraft a disgusting human practice. And humans are filthy creatures to the monsters. So, Draculaura practices in private.<br/><br/>On the first day of classes, Headmistress Bloodwood calls Clawdeen into her office. Clawdeen looks down at her hands and sees her claws and spots disappearing. When she calms, her spots and claws come back. She admits the changes to Frankie. Frankie believes Clawdeen's flight or fight response triggers the changes. Clawdeen needs to remain calm, or the school will know her secret.<br/><br/>Professor Komos, the history teacher, tells the class about the last half-human in the school, Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde covertly worked on an experiment to remove his human side but was banished from the school before he could take the potion. Clawdeen tells Professor Komos she wants to write a paper about Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde. He approves her topic and tells her that Mr. Hyde's journals are in the library. So, Frankie and Clawdeen find the journals and decipher the lab's location. They sneak around at night and discover Draculaura doing witchcraft. They instantly accept her and thinks she is intriguing. But the friends don't know someone is watching, including the school.<br/><br/>For a children's movie, this film provides a well-thought-out mystery with classic monsters. Based on the Monster High dolls, this first-time musical for the Nickelodeon channel is entertaining while teaching about acceptance, parental pressure, and community. The songs are catchy, and the dance moves are fun. You will look forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Nikki and Nora: Sister Sleuths",
    "review":"Nikki and Nora are fraternal twins with nothing in common. Nora works as a lawyer for a defense attorney, George Bolton. Nikki is a struggling actress who comes from another disappointing audition to find her landlord, Marguerite, putting an eviction notice on her door. Cliff tells Nikki she has 14 days if it's her first notice, and Nikki turns to see a man she doesn't know. Cliff explains he is the executor of Charles Porter's will, and he named Nikki the benefactor. Cliff explains that if Nikki doesn't want it, she can sign it away, and he can sell it. He will give Nikki 90% of the profits, and she needs the money. Nikki is apprehensive and asks Cliff for the catch. He explains that Nikki isn't the only benefactor. Nora is too. After ten years apart, Nora isn't happy that Nikki is asking for a favor. Nora tells Nikki she will look into it and walks back to her office.<br/><br/>Nora decides to go to George's home to get a file for their client. Nikki sees Nora standing outside and apologizes for coming into her office. Nikki agrees to come along.<br/><br/>They enter George's home to find the door open and the dog in the laundry room. The laptop screen reads, 'I can't do it anymore. I'm sorry.' Then Nikki finds George dead on the ground with a gun in his hand. Nikki and Nora call the police, and Detective Sanchez comes with the newly-named Detective Robby. Sanchez quickly determines suicide but sends in the gun for a ballistics check. However, something doesn't ring true for Nora. Can these twins put aside their differences to find the killer before Sanchez closes the case?<br/><br/>This movie is a compelling twist on a trending formula. Typically, the amateur detective doesn't have a job in law enforcement. Nora is a lawyer who defends people the police deduce may be guilty of a crime. Nikki doesn't have experience in the law. However, she acquired lots of skills in preparing for roles. And the overarching story is their parents' murder. Charles was looking into their parents, but Nora and Nikki never knew about Charles. It will be interesting to see how this series pans out over time. And the killer will leave you a gasp.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Country Romance",
    "review":"Sara's boss, Mr. Lever, wants her to work on a pitch and present it in a week. But her father, Frank, calls on vacation. Developers are coming to their vineyard to make an offer. Sara is far-removed from farm life, but she understands a good deal, so Frank thinks she is the best choice. Sara promises Mr. Lever that she will work on the pitch and return before the presentation.<br/><br/>Sara arrives at the vineyard, and Gabe notices she dropped her sweater. He politely picks it up and introduces himself. His family runs a vineyard, but half of their crop died. As Gabe examines the land, he can see the crop is ready for harvest, and Sara is shocked. Sara has no idea how to harvest and needs time to create the presentation. So she makes Gabe, and his daughter, Mabel, an offer. If they help her harvest, they can keep half the yield. When Sara looks at the paperwork, she can see it's a good deal, but the developers want to turn the land into a hotel. Sara discerns a connection between herself, the vineyard, and Gabe. Can she leave everything and sign the deal for her job?<br/><br/>Not even a cute and witty kid can save this script. The actors do what they can, but the plot offers nothing compelling. The writers added a bake-off at a festival for flare, but it all doesn't help. You can have this in the background while making apple torte.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
