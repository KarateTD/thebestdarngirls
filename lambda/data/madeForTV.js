    "review":"After months of missed opportunities, Brant asks Sandra to spend time with him at his family's cabin. They drive up a deserted dirt road, and Brant gets out of the car.  He explains they have to walk the rest of the way.  Sandra loves the cabin; however, she is slightly crestfallen to learn her cell doesn't work. They enjoy hikes, sitting by the fire, and ax throwing.  On these trips, she lost her phone and her clothes.  Brant suggests she should wear his mom's clothes for the time being.  Sandra felt weird, but Brant convinced her it was ok.  Later, Sandra waited in the bed for Brant wearing sexy lingerie but lost focus when she heard a commotion outside.  Sandra walked out to check on Brant but found another man in the woods.  She tried to run away; however, she didn't get far.  She wakes up with a bruise on her head and a chain cuffed to her ankle.  Brant introduces Sandra to his father, Langley. If she doesn't follow Langley's rules, he will kill her.  If that's not bad enough, Brant horrifies Sandra when he tells her she is a gift for his father.  She will replace his mother and be Langley's new wife.  With no phone, no people within miles, and no internet, how will Sandra escape these sick and evil men?<br/><br/>This movie puts the creepy factor on 11.  You will be grossed out and entertained. At first, it's unclear why Brant continues with his father's plan.  The writers explain everything, but you have to stick to the movie. With that aside, it's eye-opening to ascertain how Brant picked Sandra.  While her looks were just one aspect, she had a lot of red flags for him to read.  He read her profile and saw a woman unsatisfied with her life, little family, and desperate to create a new family. While entertaining, watch with the lights on, and stay out of the woods.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
