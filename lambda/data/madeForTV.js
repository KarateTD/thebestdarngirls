    "mtitle":"Nantucket Noel",
    "review":"Christina owns Seaside Toys at the local harbor and meets with the other shop owners, Molly, Harriet, and Jacob. They heard a big corporate honcho named Oscar is in town to revitalize the harbor.  Her friends are ok with it, but Christina is not. Christina walks into her store to see Andy and his daughter, Wink, looking at the lighthouse.  Wink remembers that Andy needed a gift, and they go into the store.  As Andy is on the phone, Christina sees Wink put a toy mermaid in her coat. Instead of reporting the girl, Christina allows Wink to work it off.  Gratefully, Andy accepts.  He understands Wink is acting out because of his divorce. On the first day of the Seaside Noel, Christina introduces Andy and Wink to her friends.  And Andy does the same with his father, Oscar.  Christina asks if he is the same Oscar in charge of the changes.  And he confirms her theory.  She mentions the revitalization, and Oscar stops her.  He is doing a complete rebuild because the dock can't withstand the new marina's weight.  The shop owners must leave ASAP, so Oscar's company can stick to their strict schedule.  Christina refuses to accept this.  Since Oscar won't budge, Christina decides to convince Andy to help come up with a solution.  As she shows him the harbor's beauty, Andy falls in love.  But Oscar warns Andy that he is a victim of a love con.  Will Andy listen to his heart, or his wallet.<br/><br/>Based on Let It Snow by Nancy Thayer, this movie has a few endearing moments, but it's not enough to draw your attention.  With the Hallmark staple, the movie comes to a more realistic conclusion for the main characters.  Even with the practical ending, this movie is background noise for holiday decorating.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Anni sits with her guidance counselor, Ms. Kent, to discuss her college picks and SAT scores. Anni and her best friend, Katie, dreamed of going to the same college and living together since they were kids.  To do that, Ms. Kent tells Anni she needs to bring up her math SAT score.  When Katie tells Anni she got early admissions, Anni tells Katie about her worries.  Katie tells Anni not to worry and have fun at a party tonight. As Anni finds a free moment to study, Riley approaches to help.  He works for Educating Youth Charity, and they offer help for entrance exams, scholarships, and application essays. The next day, Katie grabs her mother's phone and texts the guy who helped her.  Katie pretends to be her mom, Lisa, and offers to pay the same amount if he gets Anni into college. When Katie tells Anni, Anni is furious. Anni wants to tell, but it would implicate Katie.  She tries to keep it a secret until one person is missing and another is dead.  Can Anni escape the lies before she dies?<br/><br/>Inspired by the College Admission Scandal, this movie adds a mob-like atmosphere to a non-violent situation. With this crazy plot, the movie does pull off one curveball to keep viewers watching.  And don't worry, you will get a full character recap at the end.  Knowing the real story makes the plot comical instead of frightening.  So watch this movie for a good laugh.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dancing Through the Snow",
    "review":"Firefighter Michael adores his little ballerina, Lily. As he practices with Lily, Michael's friend, Noah, comes in through the back door and tapes them dancing.  Noah promises to delete the video, and they go Christmas tree shopping.  At the Christmas Tree farm, Michael gives tree tips to a female customer. The woman is Lily's ballet teacher, Olivia. When Michael gets to work, his co-workers prance around.  Instead of deleting the video, Noah posted it online, and it went viral. When Michael picks Lily up from class, he and Olivia chat about her progress.  They make a not-date date to meet for coffee and talk more.  Before she heads out to meet with Michael, Olivia's friend, Jordyn, shows Olivia a cute ballet video Jordyn found online.  Olivia asks how Jordyn knows Michael, but Jordyn had no idea the ballet dad was Olivia's date.  With Michael's 15 minutes of fame looming, that's not the couple's most complicated hurdles to love.  It's a little girl losing her Christmas traditions and a doomed bank loan.  Olivia borrowed money to open her studio, and the full payment is due.  If she can't get the money in time, she will close her studio and move to Florida.  Who will be the voice of reason to get this love back on track?<br/><br/>This movie has a sweet beginning, a slow but romantic middle, and a sweet end.  While it has some wise words for kids dealing with dating parents, the script doesn't offer much else.  Noah and Jordyn provide comic relief to break apart the monotony, but it's not enough to make you invest in the characters. Save this movie if you are snowed in and need to kill two hours.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
