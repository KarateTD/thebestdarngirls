    "review": "TV host Kendra concludes today's show and gets updates from her executive producer, best friend Natalie, and assistant, Emma, for tomorrow's taping. She then leaves the studio to visit her mother, Meredith, in the hospital. Meredith encourages Kendra to be strong because her time is near. Then, Meredith dies. Natalie found a refreshing spiritual retreat, and Emma booked the excursions. Natalie reminds Kendra that she must take her bodyguard, Charlie, because it's studio policy for international travel.<br/><br/>Kendra and Charlie arrive at the resort, and Charlie scans the room. Afterward, Kendra dismisses Charlie for the evening and sleeps. In the morning, Kendra goes to breakfast and spots Charlie across the restaurant. She asks the waitress to extend an invitation to Charlie, and he joins her. They share a laugh and food, but Kendra sees a handsome man sitting at another table. She recalls seeing him get out of a hot tub with a sexy physique.<br/><br/>Kendra and Charlie walk a trail. He encourages Kendra to walk ahead of him to receive the spiritual experience. Kendra strolls forward, and the handsome man, Malcolm, stumbles out of the woods. Within days, Malcolm and Kendra bond over grief, fall in love, get engaged, and marry. Charlie accepts their marriage to Kendra's face but believes something is wrong. He asks his friend, Ricky, to investigate Malcolm, his business, and his financials. Ricky thinks Charlie's fears stem from jealousy but moves forward with the investigation. Ricky returns with some harsh and frightening truths and alerts Charlie. Will Kendra believe Charlie, or will she choose Malcolm?<br/><br/>Before you get mad, listen to the opening sequence. Kendra admits she had a desperate desire for love. This moment of clarity gives the viewer a look into Kendra's redeeming quality. She takes accountability for her mistakes. The actors give a stellar performance with a mid-level script, and the sets are breathtaking. This movie feels like a Tyler Perry film with a Lifetime budget. Viewers should follow the protective Charlie to enjoy this film. Otherwise, Kendra's actions are infuriating.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Get Rich or Die Trying",
    "review": "Manager Keely worries that her business partner, best friend Nicole, hasn't taken the time to grieve. Nicole doesn't want to mourn because she doesn't think her sister, Darcie, is missing. She needed to return to The Over Easy diner and cook to take her mind off her problems. Chef Nicole will prove it by cooking for a critic, Derrick, later that evening. Nicole cooks for Derrick, but he starts to choke. She left a bread tag inside his French toast. Keely comforts Nicole and begs her to take a break.<br/><br/>Nicole visits Darcie's home. She finds a notebook in a drawer, and a slip of paper falls. Darcie wrote a warning that her company, Sweet Co., kidnapped her. Nicole calls the Sweet Co.'s number and registers for the weekend seminar.<br/><br/>Nicole drives to the property, and the valet politely forces Nicole out of her vehicle. She enters the complex, and Candace greets her. Candace gives Nicole her tight schedule and stringent rules. Then, Nicole hears a commotion. The room becomes abuzz when everyone sees Melissa enter. Melissa welcomes her sweethearts before exiting.<br/><br/>Once Candace leaves, Nicole calls and updates Keely. Keely cautions Nicole about falling for their tactics. If Darcy could fall for their scheme, anyone could. Nicole assures Keely that she will persevere through their mind control. However, the allure may be too much. Can Nicole find Darcie before losing everything to this evil MLM?<br/><br/>This film starts slow, but has a captivating leader. The film follows the BITE model of authoritarian control. Sweet Co. is similar to NXIVM and LuLaRoe. They pull you in with the promise of growth and sisterhood, but it becomes all-encompassing. While the concept is strong, the title doesn't make sense unless you watch the movie from Melissa's perspective. The film takes an hour for the craziness to start. Until then, you get uncomfortable laughter and mediocre acting. This movie is watchable, but don't cancel plans.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sins of the Bride",
    "review": "Cassie kisses her fianc√©, Jack, before going to work and reminds him about events later that evening. He forgot and had made other plans. Cassie asks if he's having cold feet because he shows little interest in their nuptials. He confirms that he's ready.<br/><br/>Cassie goes to the church, and the best man, Greg, is there. He stands in for the groom and gives Cassie a passionate hug. She asks Greg about Jack's apprehensions, but Greg swears Jack loves her.<br/><br/>The wedding day is here, but Jack isn't. The wedding party calls emergency services, but no one can find him. Cassie cries with humiliation because Jack stood her up. Greg finds Cassie and professes his love for her. They have sex. In her afterglow, Cassie gets a phone call from a hospital several towns over. Jack is there because someone beat him and left him for dead.<br/><br/>Cassie rushes to the hospital and finds Jack bruised and broken. Greg offers to move in with the couple to help care for Jack. Cassie attempts to argue but agrees. Greg promises not to mention their rendezvous. However, Greg has darker intentions. Will Cassie and Jack uncover Greg's desires before he exposes the bride's sins?<br/><br/>This movie defines 'the audacity' while it makes you clutch your pearls. The actors play with the gray areas of the script with all-knowing looks, secret histories, and lasting touches. The backing track and Ariel's observations will make the audience chuckle. You should watch this movie until the end for an extra dose of insanity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Kiki drops off her chocolate zucchini muffins at a local store. She rushes out to meet her family for dinner and accidentally bumps into a man, Clay, behind her. Clay buys a dozen.<br/><br/>Kiki meets the family for Sunday Supper and confirms she will cook for Jenna and Andrew's wedding. Jenna's concerned because Kiki hasn't cooked for 100 people before. Kiki tells Jenna she has everything under control. However, Kiki hides her fears.<br/><br/>Josh, Evan, and Andrew meet at a bar to discuss the stag party. Andrew doesn't want the traditional festivities. So, Evan promises to throw a low-key celebration. Then, the best man, Clay, joins them. Andrew informs the guys that Clay owns the 7 Basil restaurant and other establishments.<br/><br/>Kiki delivers several pizzas and almost drops one as Clay catches it. He introduces himself to her, and they laugh. Clay meets the family, and Kiki tells Shari about her run-in with Clay earlier. Clay pulls Kiki aside and offers to help with the wedding. Kiki says she's fine until Clay breaks down the logistics. She realizes she may need assistance. Clay offers to be a helping hand whenever she needs it. As they work together, they fall in love. But will Kiki's stubborn ways end their professional and personal relationship?<br/><br/>This final installment of the series brings back all three couples with one goal: a wedding. The romance between Kiki and Clay feels like a byproduct of the wedding's drama. Even the stag party has more interesting highs and lows than Kiki's problems. This film feels like a second Jenna and Andrew story, not Kiki's first. If Hallmark continues the Hearts franchise, hopefully, Kiki's tale will get a second shot.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Not My Family: The Monique Smith Story",
    "review": "Monique returns home from work, and her mother, Elizabeth, takes her money. Monique begs for the cash because she needs to pay graduation expenses. Elizabeth refuses and beats her. Monique can't take the beatings anymore. She waits for Elizabeth to leave and searches Elizabeth's room. She finds her social security card, birth certificate, and cash. Then, Monique gets on the first bus out of town. She thinks it will be the first step in her new life. Unfortunately, she lands in the home of a pimp, Caroline.<br/><br/>During her exploitation, Monique finds love. She escapes Caroline, gets married, and gets pregnant. This happily-ever-after doesn't last. Monique leaves her husband and returns to Elizabeth's home. Elizabeth continues to be cruel, but Elizabeth's mother, Sarah, gives Monique unconditional love.<br/><br/>Later, Monique gives birth to her first child. She goes through the documentation with the nurse and asks how to find her birth certificate. Monique goes to the municipal building, but they don't have a record of her birth or death. Monique realizes that Elizabeth's mistreatment stems from a horrific truth: Monique is not her child. Monique will search for decades to find her family, the truth, and her name.<br/><br/>Based on I Am The Ancestor: Before I Die I Must Tell My Story by S. Monique Smith, this film will trigger your rage. Monique falls into abusive situations, looking for love. She becomes prey to molesters, pimps, and abusers looking for motherly affection. It's not until she has children that Monique sees Elizabeth's evil nature. The set designers ensured fashion and technology fell within the period. And the actors will invoke your compassion and rage. However, this movie should have a trigger warning for assault survivors. Monique's trauma is the beginning of her story, not the conclusion. She triumphs, creating a new legacy and cycle for her family and future generations. This film should spark a conversation about family secrets and ignorance.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
