    "mtitle": "I Am Mary Jo Buttafuoco",
    "review": "Mary Jo Connery sat in class when a young man named Joey Buttafuoco introduced himself and sat next to her. They laughed, and he quickly charmed her. It wasn't long before the two were married. Mary Jo loves her fun-loving and hard-working husband. She is proud to be his wife. That feeling grows when she discovers that she is pregnant with their first child. While she steps into the role of mother, Joey doesn't grow up. With the birth of their second child, Joey's childish behavior becomes worse. Mary Jo, raised to be a good catholic, stands by her vows and honors her marriage.<br/><br/>One day, Amy Fisher arrives at her door, selling candy bars. Mary Jo offers to buy a few, only to discover they are store brand. She brushes off the encounter. Later, Amy comes to her door again and gives Mary Jo another name, Anna Marie. She informs Mary Jo that her sister, Amy, is having an affair with Joey. Before Mary Jo closes the door, Amy pulls out a gun and shoots Mary Jo in the face. Mary Jo wakes up in the hospital to grim news. The police calmly tell Mary Jo to rest while they look for the shooter. Mary Jo won't relax ever again. She will have to survive the recovery, fame, criticism, depression, and addiction.<br/><br/>This new telling of the story that took tabloids by storm gives Mary Jo's perspective and thought process throughout her ordeal. She narrates the film to explain her actions before and after the infamous shooting. The movie focuses on her balancing her duties as a wife and mother while being lied to by her husband and judged in the media. This film gives viewers a triumph story, but something won't sit right with you. Mary Jo places the blame for the affair on Amy. She accuses Amy of being a flirty temptress whom Joey attempted to push away. Mary Jo doesn't blame Joey for sleeping with a minor even today. That's where her story loses its luster and compassion. Mary Jo is, and will always be the victim of this crime, and that shouldn't get lost in anyone's retelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Disappointed, Bea leaves.<br/><br/>Jodi drives Bea to Matt's home, and to Jodi's surprise, Matt's girlfriend, Eve, and Eve's son, Gil, are there. Jodi leaves while they try to connect. Later, Bea hears Gil hysterically crying. He tells her that someone killed Izzy. Bea demands to go home, so Matt takes her. Bea cries with Jodi and gets an idea.

It offers current influencers and old-school stalkers to garner a vast audience. The plot entices viewers with intrigue and scandal. Then the conclusion throws you for a loop. However, you may have inklings once the family relocates to the cabin. This film is a fun pearl clutcher with a bratty teen you can stand.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secrets on the Ranch",
    "review": "Romy Taylor is tired of city life. During another meeting, she gets a call from her mom, Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor wants to sell their family farm.

He won't know who the person is until they run a DNA test. However, Romy believes it's her sister, Zara. After Romy finds Zara's diary, she fears Mr. Taylor killed Zara. Can she handle the truth?<br/><br/>The plot setup is familiar. A big-city girl returns to her family farm to save it and runs into an old schoolmate. On any other network, they slowly fall in love before a misunderstanding that almost ruins the romance. But find their way back to each other. However, this is Lifetime. So someone has to die. The acting is standard, but the lighting is horrible. The mystery spans generations, giving several characters motives. This story has a compelling edge that you get from the Hallmark Mystery Channel.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

So watch this picture and enjoy the land down under.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Accused: The Karen Read Story",
    "review": "Karen Read wakes up in the middle of the night and notices her boyfriend, Officer John, isn't there. Karen wants to look for John, but her dad warns her to stay home. Then, she rings her friends, and they search the snowy roads for John. Karen finds John's body in an embankment covered in snow. She calls 9-1-1 for assistance.<br/><br/>The EMTs put John in an ambulance, but won't let Karen go with him. They escort her into another ambulance. Nurses take Karen's blood at the hospital as she begs for an update on John's status. Her father enters with horrible news. John passed away.<br/><br/>Karen returns to John's home, and his family is in the kitchen. They calmly ask her to pack and leave so they can care for John's children in their home. Later, the police interview Karen. She worries that she is a suspect after they take her car and phone. So, she gets a lawyer. Devastated, Karen doesn't know what's next. That's until her lawyer calls. The police believe she backed into John after a fight and left him to die. Karen hopes the police will understand that she did not end John's life, but she doesn't remember everything that happened because she was intoxicated. They dash her hopes when they change Karen's charge from manslaughter to 2nd degree murder. Will Karen spend her life in jail?<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, Karen Read's arrest exposed the dark side of the Boston Police Department. This film doesn't take sides. While it's not a linear story, it showed Karen's obsessive nature about their relationship. This movie also highlights the sexist nature of the police department. They didn't investigate the crime and took shortcuts. The trial is over, but the movie lets you decide if Karen was guilty or innocent. That's what makes it compelling.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
