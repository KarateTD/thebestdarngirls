    "review":"Olivia leaves her unapproving family behind for college life and walks past Riley while looking for her dorm.  Riley's mom, Dr. Catherine O'Connor, wants her daughter to stay home longer.  But if Riley wants to start school now, Catherine hopes she joins Pi Gamma Beta. Riley worries her generalized anxiety disorder will hold her back, but Catherine assures Riley that her legacy status and full scholarship will get her in the door.  Olivia goes on a walk and sees Riley in the hallway. The two freshmen grab some food and talk all night.  Riley convinces Olivia to be her wingman for sorority scouting.  Olivia says yes, but the journalism student can smell the story.  Jasmine approaches Olivia immediately and holds no punches about wanting Olivia to join.  But Olivia will join if Riley gets a bid.  After making the girls walk on glass, Riley and Olivia get their offers and move into the house.  But it's not over because hell week starts. At a party, Olivia drinks under peer pressure, and Riley helps her get home.  The next day, Olivia goes looking for Riley but can't find her. Someone found Riley's body in the woods, and she is dead of an apparent suicide.  Olivia can't believe Riley could kill herself, and she will put her journalistic knowledge to work to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>A remake of the 2002 classic, loosely based on the hazing death of Donna Bedinger, this movie follows the underlying premises of hazing turned deadly but creates an entirely different story.  While it doesn't have the same intrigue as its predecessor, the stats at the end will break your heart.  Hazing continues to be an epidemic across college campuses, and it's sadly unreported.  As a society, we need to ask ourselves, when does a sorority or fraternity become a cult, and what can we do to stop it?<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After his wife, Lizzie, died in a car accident, Jack decided to go to her favorite place with their two kids, Tyler and Mikki.  Lizzie called her family's home the castle because it was next to an old lighthouse. Before she passed away, Jack fell ill due to PTSD, and she stayed by his side every day.  When things go dire, Lizzie promises Jack that the family will go to the lighthouse if he dies.  Then, she would fix up the lighthouse and use it to signal him in heaven.  Now, Jack wants to do the same for her, and he has one summer to do it. But Mikki, the lighthouse, nor his mother-in-law will make it easy. But with Lizzie's spirit guiding him, he will find the tools to navigate through any troubled water, literally and metaphorically.<br/><br/>Based on One Summer by David Baldacci, this movie is pure love from beginning to end.  It reconnects a family but doesn't force a love story on the viewers.  While the film pulls out a chunk of the book's plot, the movie still resonates while drawing attention to PTSD. Before you get upset with Mikki, you must remember she lost her mom when she thought her dad would die.  This anger she feels is more a sign of depression than a misguided teen.  This film will leave a lasting imprint on anyone who watches.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, Maggie became the only survivor of the East Bay Butcher Ray Colton.  Today, she teaches criminal forensic psychology to students more interested in her history than their studies. Her estranged husband, Richard, a teacher at the university, cheated on her with one of his students, Sarah.  Richard left Maggie for Sarah, but he is trying to win Maggie back.  Maggie's daughter, Jenny, thinks Maggie kicked Richard out and resents Maggie. Maggie's friend, Alyssa, talks Maggie into enjoying the single life and going to a club.  At the club, Kyle approaches Maggie, and they spark a conversation. She explains to Kyle about Richard's infidelity.  And to prolong the embarrassment, Sarah follows Maggie around. She asks Kyle for one kiss, and they end up in his hotel room.  After a night of passion, Kyle starts asking Maggie about Ray, and Maggie bolts in disgust.  The next day, Kyle's presence in Maggie's class leaves her speechless.  Kyle is her student. Then Maggie finds a dead possum in her car.  Maggie knows someone is trying to terrorize her, but she doesn't know who.  When the police find a dead body has all the signatures of Ray, Maggie knows her life and Jenny's is in danger.  She will need to come face to face with evil to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>While the plot is interesting, the trademark Lifetime bratty teen, cheating husband, and non-twisty plot twist will leave you wanting the story to end.  This movie only has one moment that will have you waiting with bated breath.  It's Maggie confronting her demons head-on. This movie is background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Now, she plans on using her legal expertise to save the library for Josh and continue her relationship with Rick.  But she does so much more.<br/><br/>Props to Hallmark for giving its viewer a new and exciting story! Maggie isn't a woman trying to find love because she has it.  She forgot her reason to love. Maggie fixes the past for others but discovers her destiny. During her wild trip down memory lane, Maggie will restore Ash's confidence while bringing him love.  Let's hope Hallmark will find a way to give these characters a part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
