    "review":"Karina is working hard at her shop while her husband handles the woodworking.  One day, an adorable little girl comes in wanting to try on one of her fairy dresses.  The little girl is named Mallie.  As they talk, Mallie’s mom rushes in, panicked.  Lena worries about someone taking her child and admonished Mallie for walking away.   The next day, Karina offers to watch Mallie in the store while Lena runs a few errands.  When Karina’s back is turned, a man tries to take Mallie.  Karina runs out of the store and grabs Mallie out of his car.  Karina explains the situation to Lena and wants to call the cops but Lena stops her.  Karina can’t understand Lena’s lackadaisical attitude but respects her wishes.  To ease her fears, Karina meets with Lena and Mallie for a tea party.  When Lena walks away, Mallie says her name was Emily at her old house with her old toys.  Karina asks Lena what Mallie meant but Lena brushes it off.  Karina can’t let it go.  Karina starts doing research and learns a little girl named Emily was kidnapped 5 years ago and declared dead by absentia.  Karina believes Mallie is Emily but she needs more information to prove it.  Can Karina save Mallie and prove she is Emily?<br/><br/>An interesting but familiar premise with a slight twist.  Lena is able to get the jump on everyone and make herself look like the victim of Karina’s odd and obsessive behavior.  Overall, the movie lacked a certain quality to keep you interested in the overall plot.  It’s a little too easy to tune out while watching.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Remember Me, Mommy?",
    "review":"Creative writing teacher Rebecca squares her shoulders for the next school year at Clark Academy. She deals with overprivileged, mean girls and their high society and large-donating parents every day.  As she walks through the dorms, she sees Janey with the new girl Elena.  While Elena says everything is fine, she knows Janey is on the warpath.  Afterward, Rebecca gives Janey a writing assignment on kindness to reprimand her for bullying Elena.  Later that night, Rebecca sees someone has spray-painted her car with obscenities.  She finds Janey’s school ID on the ground.  Rebecca doesn’t know that Janey is innocent.  A necklace, photographs, and a dead student will lead her to the truth.<br/><br/>This movie follows the Lifetime formula, it does give a new perspective to the \“mean girl\” cliche.  Janey, as foreshadowed by Grace, isn’t the bad girl she portrays herself.  There is more hiding behind the pranks, alcohol, and vaping.  The motive behind the crimes should be a surprise but the title gives it away. You will see who is really the mean girl.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Henry goes to earth has Henry: The Heavenly Handyman.  It’s obvious he is having trouble with the rules.  But he had no idea, rule number 2 would give him the most trouble and joy.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of City of Angels, this movie gives a more uplifting ending for its viewers.  It’s fun to watch Henry discover the small things about the human world, like pizza. While he never gets hungry, tired, or hurt, he has to pretend when people are watching.  As he starts to fade, you will feel concerned.   As he starts to fall for Robin, it’s his connection to Sophie that brings you into the story.  Don’t forget about the cute Izzy Todd subplot.  Seeing these two break out of their shells and find each other is beautiful.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
