    "review":"Lila's home falls apart around her as she helps her son, Ian, with his application for Space X.  Ian likes to film vehicles as they drive past his home, but he catches a grizzly scene across the street.  Two people murdered a woman and saw Ian's camera.  The woman, Rocco, threatens Ian if he talks.  Then, she gets a knock at the door.  It's the repair person, Dominic.  She shows Dominic around the house but tells him Ian's room is off-limits.  So when she finds Dominic in Ian's room, Lila promptly shows Dominic the exit.  Then, Dominic attacks.  Lila and Ian run to Ian's safe space, a fortified room with food, video surveillance equipment, and no cell service.  Dominic tells Lila about Ian's recording but not the contents.  Lila agrees to come out if Ian can stay behind.  Dominic agrees, and Lila gives in to his demands.  Lila sees Rocco standing in the kitchen as they leave Ian's room.  Rocco thinks Ian will talk and wants him dead.  Lila tries to explain that his autism will hinder his police statement and credibility, but Rocco wants proof.  Lila gets away and runs back to the safe room.  Lila and Ian have to find a way out before Rocco and Dominic injure them or any other good Samaritans.<br/><br/>With a compelling backing track, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat.  Every item, action, or speech is a clue. The script pulls viewers into Lila and Ian's life but doesn't drag the family history out too long.  You get a connection without getting bored.

    "review":"Carly and her mother, Sarah, learned that Sarah's competition, Amanda, lied about receiving a contract from Kyle.  Sarah calls Kyle and makes a consultation appointment for an interior design job.  Kyle listens to Sarah, but 18-year-old Carly attracts his interest.  During their first design meeting, Kyle asks Carly out on a date.  It doesn't take much for Carly to get caught in Kyle's web.  While Carly believes she's claiming her independence, Sarah sees the truth.  Kyle is a manipulator with plans to control her daughter.  But a gunshot will bring Kyle's sick and twisted past and evil game to light.<br/><br/>Let's not be so quick to jump down Carly's throat.  The right manipulator can use a person's need to be independent to control them and turn them against their family.

    "review":"Rose travels to her hometown with work in tow.  Although, Rose has another responsibility.  Rose's mother is too preoccupied with the bakery to sell her grandmother's store.  Now, Rose's mom thinks this is the best time and puts Rose in charge.  Rose walks into the store to find racks of old clothes.  As Rose walks to the back, Cole sees the front door is open.  When he lays eyes on Rose, he can't speak.  She feels the same.  She remembers her crush as a loveable prankster, and Cole remembers Rose as pushy and uptight.  They make quick introductions and walk away.  Later, Rose goes to her parents' home and sees an old camper.  She deduces it will be perfect for her nonprofit.<br/><br/>Rose tells her brother, Rich, and her dad, but the camper needs a lot of work.  Rose asks Rich for advice, and Rich tells her that Cole is the best man for the job.  Then Rose learns he needs help with his proposal, but he doesn't have a brick-and-mortar shop for it.  Rose will hand off her grandmother's shop to him if Cole signs the documents.  Will Cole's old way end their budding romance as she sees the good in him?<br/><br/>While this movie tries to capture your attention, it's a slow burn to a predictable ending.  The only moment of concern is when Rose chooses between an interview and her grandmother's shop.  And that happens much later in the film. Otherwise, this movie becomes background noise.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
