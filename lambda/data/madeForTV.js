    "mtitle": "I Was Octomom: The Natalie Suleman Story",
    "review": "Natalie is a straight-A student with six children under 7 years old. After class, she expresses her concerns to her best friend, Beth. Natalie's older children spend time together without the younger kids. The twin 2-year-olds don't connect because one is non-verbal. Natalie fears one twin will be lonely. She wants to have IVF again. Natalie chooses artificial insemination but does not tell her parents.<br/><br/>Natalie goes to her fertility specialist, Dr. Kamrava, because he implants more fertilized embryos to guarantee success. However, the doctor wakes Natalie during the procedure. Her uterus contracted and expelled the six. He wants to put six more in Natalie. Drugged, Natalie signs the papers, and Dr. Kamrava puts her back to sleep.<br/><br/>Weeks later, Natalie goes to the hospital to see if her IVF was successful. Her obstetrician discovers her hormone levels indicate multiples. Natalie chooses to carry all seven babies. Finally, the doctor requests to be Natalie's OB-GYN for the foreseeable future. Natalie agrees.<br/><br/>Natalie tries to keep her pregnancy a secret, but Angela uncovers the truth when the babies break Natalie's ribs. Natalie gives birth a few months later, and the doctor finds a surprise: an 8th baby. Natalie unknowingly becomes a household name, and the media dubs her the 'Octomom.' The hospital hires a PR consultant to help Natalie and release them from liability. Natalie doesn't want the consultant until she learns about the public's disdain for her. Natalie decides to control the narrative and feed the beast. Sadly, it's a choice she will regret.<br/><br/>Based on the life of Natalie Suleman, this movie follows her thought process while taking responsibility for her actions. Natalie admits having one more was immature at the time. However, she never planned on having eight. Surprisingly, Natalie had three saving graces: CPS, the police, and rehab. Viewers' hearts will soften to her plight because Natalie expresses accountability. This film teaches you something new about the situation but doesn't push you to change your opinion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadly Girls Trip",
    "review": "Lacey worries because her husband, Blake, didn't sleep. He's working on a proposal for Neil but doesn't believe it's good enough. Lacey assures Blake that he will land the new contract. Lacey wonders if her friends - Becca, Janice, and Addie - will notice her abstaining during the girls' trip. She hasn't told her friends she's pregnant but worries about stealing the spotlight from Becca. The trip is for Becca's birthday. Lacey chooses to keep her secret during the vacation.<br/><br/>Becca, Janice, Addie, and Lacey drive to the estate and unpack their bags. Lacey opens her makeup bag and finds a lipstick thumb drive. She realizes she got Janice's bag and returns it. Lacey goes to bed after 1 A.M. with the TV on. She wakes up to hear muffled arguing at 4 A.M.. The yelling stops, and Lacey goes to bed. Lacey wakes a few hours later and walks on her balcony for fresh air. She looks down and sees Janice dead on the ground with blood pooling at her head. The police conclude Janice's death was an accident, but Lacey remembers the argument. Lacey will uncover what happened on their deadly girls' trip.<br/><br/>The movie is a whodunit, but Lifetimers can piece together the clues because the foreshadowing is obvious. However, the motive isn't clear until one woman talks about her past. The plot makes the audience believe Janice has some underhanded deals at the bank, but the story has many layers. Then, pettiness and lies tear their friendship apart. This aspect makes the film a turn-off. When the women communicate, they stand together. The final fight scene is poorly edited but entertaining.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Abducted in the Everglades",
    "review": "Beverly calls her daughter, Carli, while Carli travels with her best friend, Simone. The college women want to spend spring break in Florida's South Beach. Carli begs Beverly not to worry and ends the call.<br/><br/>Simone and Carli arrive in South Beach, and Simone begs Carli to be impulsive. Carlie agrees. They pull over and drop their bags with a concierge. Simone puts her phone in her bag to deter pickpockets and gives Carli the bag receipt and ID. Carli puts the ticket into her fanny pack but keeps her phone. Simone instructs Carli to share her location. If someone steals Carli's phone, they can find it with Simone's.<br/><br/>At the bar, Simone sees Pete and flirts. Pete tells them about an exclusive party at the beach and invites them. Carli, Simone, and Pete arrive at an empty beach. Then, Pete points out his cousin, Luke. Carli freezes because Luke is her ex-boyfriend. Then Pete yells for Luke. Simone is convulsing. They argue about what to do next as Carli runs over to help. Luke says that Pete gave Simone too much. Then, Carli feels the effects of the drugs and passes out.<br/><br/>Beverly's phone wakes her. It's the police. They found Simone, and she's in a coma. Beverly decides to fly to Florida after the police refuse to look for Carli. In Florida, Carlie wakes up, blindfolded, gagged, and bound. Luke planned to drug Carli, create revenge porn, and make her lose her scholarship. It would be his revenge for dumping him. He's not sure what to do next, so Pete takes control. Carli must escape before Luke and Pete kill her. Will Beverly find her first?<br/><br/>This movie is a race to see who can be the dumbest. Beverly preaches safety but keeps herself in danger. Simone is a party girl with zero self-awareness. Pete is a manipulator, and Luke is an abusive stalker. The script foreshadows a lot as the girls decide what to bring on their club-hopping journey. However, it briefly mentions Luke. Beverly's search will drive you crazy, but Carli's fighting spirit saves the movie. She does everything possible to muster the strength to overpower her kidnappers and survive.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Royal We",
    "review": "Prince Desmond and Princess Coralina take engagement photos. When the two wed, their kingdoms will merge under one alliance, and they will become king and queen. Desmond's courtier, Edwin, writes the royal decree for the happy couple. A few weeks later, Edwin sits at his desk and vandalizes images of Coralina. She dumped the prince for plumber Coby. Edwin knows this uproar will further strife between the two nations, and Desmond must find a way to smooth things over. Desmond remembers that Coralina has a little sister, Princess Beatrix, who dropped out of the public eye years ago as a teen. Beatrix will be the rightful heir. He vows to find Beatrix, marry her, and merge their nations.<br/><br/>Chloe knocks on her best friend's door. She gave Bea the weekend to mourn her breakup. Chloe reminds Bea they have a presentation to attract a new corporate sponsor for their foundation. Bea looks for her phone but can't find it, so Chloe calls it. When they locate the phone, they discover several missed calls from an international area code. Bea tells Chloe to ignore them, grabs the phone, and enters the bathroom. Bea picks up the phone and demands the caller stop contacting her in French.<br/><br/>After their presentation, Chloe notices a car following them. Bea tells Chloe to relax. Bea and Chloe leave with the men, and Chloe learns about Bea's royal lineage. The men take Bea and Chloe to Edwin and Desmond. Desmond explains the situation, but Bea wants to wait until their fathers - King Winston and King Richmond - have their summit. They won't have to get married if the summit comes to a peaceful solution.<br/><br/>The summit fails spectacularly. So, Bea knows marrying Desmond is the proper course of action. Before he proposes again, Bea decides to have a fun night in Boston. She will show Desmond the world outside of his sheltered cage. However, he will reintroduce her to the royal treatment. These two inspire growth in each other, their families, and their countries.<br/><br/>Chloe and the Kings make this movie. The writers made Chloe the voice of the audience. King Winston and King Richmond's encounters give viewers the most polite takedown in Hallmark history. The secondary characters are so captivating that the primary ones become bland. Also, the editors put social media posts on screen. This addition brought the script into today's era but wasn't necessary. The conclusion highlighted the upcoming two royal movies - The Reluctant Royal and Royal-ish - while paying homage to Royal Matchmaker. This film is comical but will lose your attention momentarily.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Killing the Competition",
    "review": "Elizabeth returned to her small town with her husband, Steve, and their two children, Grace and Jackson. Elizabeth remembers her time in high school. She was popular, the head dancer of the dance team, and dated the cutest boys. She makes Grace practice tirelessly to be on the dance team. She tells Grace to smile and to stop acting like a loser. Grace wonders if she wants a spot on the team, but Elizabeth says it will open doors.<br/><br/>Grace tries out with her friend, Kath, and boyfriend, Tyler, watching. During Grace's performance, she sees Elizabeth watching from behind shelves. Grace's friends think she did great until Coach Megan calls. Elizabeth didn't make the team. Elizabeth believes Megan is still jealous of her and meets with the school board. Against Megan's wish, the school board sides with Elizabeth. They allowed every girl who tried out a spot on the dance team. Grace is happy, but Elizabeth is furious. She believes accepting all the girls removes the team's legitimacy and makes Grace the 'pity dancer.'<br/><br/>Megan steps down, and another dancer's mom, Nicole, coaches the team. Elizabeth remembers and loathes Nicole. She thinks Nicole will show favoritism towards her daughter, Hannah. Grace begs Elizabeth to back down, but she won't. Elizabeth is determined to fix Grace's mistakes and make Grace's life what hers should have been. She wants to remove Tyler, Hannah, and Nicole from Grace's life. And she will kill to do it.<br/><br/>People who rage easily shouldn't watch this film. The script allows viewers to hear the subtle digs Elizabeth throws at Grace. Grace knows her mother is unwell but excuses her behavior as 'lawnmower parenting.' Viewers will understand that Elizabeth is a narcissistic stage mom. She happily sabotages Grace to make Grace dependent on her. Lifetimers should give the costume department forgiveness for Elizabeth's wild wigs. Elizabeth is a woman on a budget that micromanages Grace's life. She doesn't have time for a stylish wig. The actors put on a superb performance. You will want to call CPS. This picture will be a favorite and guilty pleasure. It's unsure who was worse: Elizabeth or Mommy Meanest.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
