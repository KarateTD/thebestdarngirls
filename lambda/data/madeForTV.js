    "mtitle":"In Love With My Partner's Wife",
    "review":"Paul enters the home of his partner, Frank, and Frank's wife, Eve. Paul thanks Eve for the homemade lunch and leaves with Frank. Frank and Paul stake out Jeffery's home. Frank goes through the front while Paul enters the backyard. Paul stumbles across Jeffery and pleads with Jeffery to put down his knife to talk. Jeffery calms down and tells Paul there is a rat on the force. As they talk, Frank shoots Jeffery.<br/><br/>Paul enters Frank's house, ready for his free lunch and spirited conversation with Paul, but Paul's not there. Due to Addison's Disease, Eve has a dizzy spell, and Paul catches her, but he notices a bruise on her neck. Paul has Eve show all her bruises and learns his partner is abusive. Paul doesn't tell anyone else, but he confronts Frank at work. Frank tells Paul he will attend therapy, but that's a lie.<br/><br/>At their captain's party, Frank and Paul mingle with their co-workers. Frank takes Eve outside the bar and slaps her. Paul runs out to help Eve, punches Frank, and offers her a place to stay.<br/><br/>Paul gets a call from his captain telling him to come to work for an I.A.B. meeting. Paul wants to inform the captain about Frank's abuse. But the captain received a tip that Paul killed Jeffery in cold blood. But that's not all; Frank took Eve's pills and made it impossible to get more. With their lives on the line, Eve and Paul go on the run to clear their name.<br/><br/>Viewers will spot Frank's abusive nature when Eve puts the breakfast on the table. Frank needs constant flattery for any task, even if it's his boss or dad. Also, the movie doesn't end with the typical solution because Frank adds another wrinkle to their plan one hour into the film. So you will want to watch to see the conclusion. The film is watchable but never grabs your full attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Twisted House Sitter",
    "review":"After a public break-up with her boyfriend, Xander, Morgan decides to take an extended, tech-free vacation from her media company. In Morgan's haste, Morgan realizes that she forgot something, runs into her home, turns off the alarm, retrieves the item, and returns to the car. Her driver, Alicia, tries to make small talk, but Morgan focuses on her phone. Morgan arrives at the airport on time and hurries out of the car but forgets her keys. Alicia sees the keys in the back seat as she backs up the car. She drives to Morgan's house and lets herself in. Alicia takes a bath, cooks, and tries on Morgan's clothes. Alicia thinks she has a home, clothes, and money she deserves. When word gets back to Morgan, this inconvenience will become the house sitter from hell.<br/><br/>This movie will make you scream, 'the audacity' more than once as Alicia quickly makes herself at home in Morgan's house. Don't be fooled because it doesn't take long for Morgan to realize something is wrong and come home. At that moment, Alicia's cunning and Morgan's business sense battle it out. While the film has a great set-up, the final fight scene is comically bad.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
