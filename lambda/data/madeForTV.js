    "mtitle":"Her Deadly Sugar Daddy",
    "review":"Bridget moved across the country with her best friend, Lindsey. Bridget's mother, Jolene, tells Bridget to get a job to pay the bills.  Bridget did apply to the Swerve blog, but the boss didn't believe she had enough life experience. At dinner with Lindsey and Jolene, Bridget catches the eye of Anthony.  But she believes he was looking at Jolene.  Without her permission, Lindsey puts Bridget on a dating app, and she has a match. While waiting on her date, Anthony sits down and introduces himself.  He tells Bridget she was the woman who caught his eye.  Then, Anthony gives Bridget his well-made business card and offers her a job as his assistant.  After waiting for hours, Bridget's date finally appears, and he is obnoxious.  Bridget leaves, but her date follows and harasses her.  Anthony stops the attack and offers her a ride home.  With her white knight's kind gesture, Bridget takes the job.  She stops in her tracks to learn the job pays $10,000 a month. At dinner with a client, the client starts to get handsy with Bridget.  She attests and tells Anthony to make the client stop.  Anthony says its part of the deal, and she doesn't have to do more than what she is willing to do. With a new sense of misplaced power, Bridget keeps the job and uses it to write her blog.  While Bridget thinks Anthony is a sugar daddy, she has no idea Anthony is a pimp, and he has killed before.<br/><br/>Bridget talking about feeling empowered by being pimped is the saddest moment in this movie. Her misguided empowerment parallels her misguided need for life experience for her blog.  Her saving grace is the strongest woman in this movie: Jolene.  Jolene doesn't fall for the nonsense Bridget spews about her new job.  Jolene quickly calls B.S. and tells her daughter to find a new line of work.  After that doesn't work, Jolene expresses her deep disappointment in a way only a mother can. If you plan on watching this movie, watch for Jolene.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Follow Me to Daisy Hills",
    "review":"Jo prepares her general store for the morning when her sister, Sophie, walks in.  Jo takes a moment to razz Sophie about her first published article in the Daisy Hills newspaper, but gets serious about the mail.  Jo saw a large letter from Iowa State addressed to Sophie.  Jo had no idea Sophie was applying to school out of state, and she worries that Sophie won't come back. Jo and Sophie's father, Mr. Mason, has to resolve the store's finances.  Without changes to the business, the general store will have to close its doors and soon.  So, Mr. Mason calls Blake, who lived in Daisy Hills, but left town for college and a job in New York, to help him keep the store.  At Sophie's graduation party, Mr. Mason tells Jo he has a surprise for her.  Awestruck, Jo sees it's Blake, her ex-boyfriend. Angry, Jo lets her feelings known to Blake but abruptly stops when Mr. Mason experiences chest pains.  To ease Mr. Mason's stress, Jo agrees to listen to Blake's three ideas.  First, create an online presence so people can shop online instead of the small town.  Second, rearrange the store based on social engineering.  Third, update the store with modern technology to save on energy costs.  Jo says no to all of Blake's ideas. To save the store, Blake and Jo have to compromise on how to update the store but within the Daisy Hills's small-town feel.<br/><br/>Are you ready Hallmarkies? This movie features the first-ever drunken tweet in a Hallmark movie.  And it's a doozy.  Jo's fear of technology comes from the fact that she doesn't know how to use it.  You will know real horror as you watch Jo unknowingly post her message to the whole world.  To make matters funnier, after the drunken post, she leaves a drunk voicemail.  That one scene is worth the entire movie. This movie can become a weekly Hallmark series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
