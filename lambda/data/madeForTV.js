    "review":"Gail is the town outcast because of her family's business, Morbid Curiosities.  The store sells murderers' memorabilia from crime scenes, jail cells, and personal effects.  While cleaning egg off the storefront with her best friend, Alexa, Gail sees a package and takes it inside.  Inside the parcel is a knife block, figurine, and Crime and Punishment.  Gail calls her wheelchair-bound grandmother, Margot, to find out if she ordered the items.  But Margot didn't.  Moments later, Gail gets a mysterious phone call asking if she got the package.  The caller hints they are related, and Gail's father is the Midwest Taxidermy Killer, G. W. Stubbs, not Gary Niven.  The caller tells Gail the items in the box are from a recent murder, and she should sell them. Detective Janice comes into the store and asks Margot about a recent customer because someone murdered the customer, who was wearing a jacket from her store.  Gail remembers the customer but tells Janice that she nor Margot had anything to do with the murder. Then, Margot gets another call asking if she sold the items yet.  After seeing a matching figurine on a crime news report, Gail has second thoughts about selling it.  However, Alexa wants to sell to make the creepy caller go away.  In a fury, Gail looks for information and finds her birth certificate.  She can see the father's name is blank.  Now, Gail has two mysteries to solve.  Who is killing her customers, and who is her father?<br/><br/>This movie is a bit slower than the crazier Lifetime films that Lifetimers are used to viewing.  It spends time showing you the hostile nature of the townspeople and Margot's abuse towards Gail.  You will look at Gail as a sympathetic character that is manipulatable. Some will spot the killer before understanding why they killed.  Make sure you stick around for the why and the conclusion.  The end makes for a peaceful resolution.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After a trying year and two stalkers, Kristen wants to put the past behind her and enjoy her life with her new husband, James, and her daughter, Mara. To help his ill-stricken mother, Maggie, James invited Maggie to live in his and Kristen's home.  The moment Maggie meets Mara and Kristen, Maggie is abrupt, rude, vaguely hostile, and camera shy. When Kristen points out Maggie's attitude problem, James blames it on Maggie's illness.  The next day, Kristen sees a man following her, gets gifts from strangers, and gets hang-up calls.  Kristen believes someone is stalking her again, and she is coming unglued.  And that's what Maggie wants, for Kristen to fall off the rails and into an asylum. With Mara on Kristen's side, Maggie will need a few dead bodies to keep her plan going.<br/><br/>First, a round of applause for Mara because this teen isn't the spoiled, snarky brat we typically get with Lifetime movies. The plot does a great job of keeping viewers in the dark about the plan, the mastermind, and the stalker until needed.  And it warns you about oversharing on the internet.  It's easy to say that this film is flipping good.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"How I Met Your Murderer",
    "review":"Mackenzie, known as Mack, hosts a crime podcast called 'How I Met Your Murderer,' produced by her best friend, June.  Mack and her husband, Henry, moved back to Henry's hometown to start a family with the assistance of IVF. After a broadcast, Mack meets with a fan who alludes to the hometown mystery of the Blue Ribbon Killer.  Curiosity gets the best of Mack, and she starts to look into the crime. But she gets a shock when she learns each victim links to Henry.  Mack worries he could be the Blue Ribbon Killer. A poster left several threatening comments on the podcast's webpage, and Mack and June are uneasy.  However, Mack's newest friend, Oliver, puts her at ease.  Oliver is a police officer by day and photographer by night. Mack hopes having a cop by her side will give her access to police information about the Blue Ribbon Killer.  Mack needs to tread lightly because her life and marriage are at risk.<br/><br/>This movie has the potential to be an H.M.M. mystery, but it lacks enough suspects to make you point your attention elsewhere.  Experienced Lifetimers will pick out the murderer in 5 seconds of the killer being on screen. Your favorite character, hands down, will be June.  She speaks truth into every moment of this film.  June is worth the watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Penelope has her bags packed to travel home for her Grandma Dot's 75th birthday bash.  But the trip won't be all fun and games.  Her manager, Liam, sent her book to the last publishing company in town, and they are interested but only if she makes extensive edits. Penelope promises to work while on vacation because she wants the published book, a dedication to her grandmother, to be Dot's present.  After arriving at Dot's home, Penelope unloads her luggage from the car when her old high school boyfriend, Jason, comes over to help. Dot asks Penelope about Jason, but Penelope shuts Dot down. She wants to focus on Dot, the party, and the book.  But Dot and Jason's grandmother have a plan up their sleeves.  They are scheming with rags, bread, and poems to get these two together.  After several run-ins, Jason comes up with a plan.  They will pretend to date for the summer to get their grandmothers off their back. Will this fake romance become a reality? Time will tell.<br/><br/>Let's give a round of applause for the grandmas of this story.  They will keep you watching from beginning to end. Every other aspect, while cute, was 100% predictable.  This movie is something to watch if you need to kill two hours or have background noise for your responsibilities.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Revenge Delivered",
    "review":"Dr. Victoria Brooks is an awarded OB GYN at St. John's Hospital.  With Dr. Peter Evans's assistance, Victoria will guide three young doctors through their residency programs.  Claire is a bright student with a can-do attitude and quick leadership skills.  Luna is a guarded Dartmouth graduate with a minor in psychology.  Noelle took a year-long sabbatical from medical school, but she is ready to start the program.  However, Claire and Luna feel that Noelle has an unfair advantage because Victoria is Noelle's mother.  After the residents leave, Victoria finishes her paperwork when the printer jams.  She runs to the printer to check, and a message prints off that reads, 'I know what you did 10/22/95.'  Victoria remembers that day because she had to choose between saving a mother or a baby.  Victoria saved the baby's life, and the mother died.  Victoria passed the father, Russel Myers, in the hospital, and she could feel his rage. Victoria leaves work and finds her car vandalized.  She takes pictures of the damage and finds a rock with a note.  The note reads, 'Next time, it won't be the window I break.'  Victoria calls the police and tells them she suspects Russel of the attacks.  Detective Garcia takes Victoria's hunch seriously because Russel has been off the grid for eight years.  But Victoria's stalker is closer than she thinks and ready to deliver revenge.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of a slow burn with a low body count.  But the last 30 seconds makes watching the film worth every minute.  With a suicide attempt, an uncomfortable dinner, and an unfortunate tattoo, this movie points the viewer in several directions at one time.  Be ready for part two.  And hats off to the wardrobe department for Dr. Victoria's stunning looks.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
