    "review": "The Jordan Sisters, a singing duo, perform for an intimate crowd before their interview. In the ride to their rental home, sisters Cherish and Roxy admit that unprompted images of their deceased father, Ray, threw them off during their performance. Their manager, Cherish's husband, Bryan, and publicist, their cousin, Halle, assure the sisters that the interview will go well. Halle meets with the duo's social media specialist, Iris, and confirms that she will post the interview. However, Roxy doesn't trust Iris because Iris is a part of Cherish's insane fan club, The Flock.<br/><br/>The Jordan Sisters sit with reporter Kelly, and the interview goes well until Kelly asks if Roxy is having an affair with Bryan. Bryan reiterates that he isn't having an affair, and Cherish believes him.<br/><br/>Cherish sees the affair rumor on her Instagram page. Iris admits she reposted the article to garner sympathy. Cherish can't believe Iris broke her trust, so she fires Iris. Later, Bryan surprises Cherish with stupendous news. A promoter offered the duo a Vegas residency. Halle and Bryan try to talk Roxy into it, but Roxy won't budge.<br/><br/>Roxy visits a bar to clear her mind and meets an old friend, country singer Nate. They laugh and drink before Roxy invites Nate to come home with her. Roxy gets a horrific surprise when she enters the home. She finds Halle hurt, Cherish bound and gagged, and Bryan unconscious. Several assailants broke into their home and stole valuable items. The detectives arrive and question Roxy. Detective Alverez catches a Freudian slip, and Roxy becomes their number one suspect. However, Roxy isn't guilty only to the police. The Flock wants to take her down too. Can Roxy prove her innocence before she loses her career, sister, and freedom?<br/><br/>This movie saves the best for last. The casting director ensured the leads could sing, and the music director offered original songs. These elements gave this film a unique feel while unveiling secrets in the music industry. This script feels childish and petty until the final reveal. The mastermind will have you hit the rewind button. This film is a musical delight with an average plot but a popcorn-worthy conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sins of My Husband",
    "review": "Katherine eats dinner with her husband, Tony, a real estate agent, when he gets an alert from one of his properties. She watches him leave with a sigh. In the morning, Katherine walks to the store, and a woman, Brenda, hands her a flyer for a missing teen named Suzie. Suzie's mother, Doreen, approaches with a grief-stricken look on her face. She pleads with Katherine to watch for Suzie, and Katherine agrees.<br/><br/>Katherine eats dinner with Tony and gently asks to sell pies to make extra money. Tony rejects the idea because he doesn't want his wife to work. He opens the hidden closet and explains that he has to clean a property. Katherine inquires why it can't wait until the morning. Tony says it will be faster because he doesn't have to deal with other people.<br/><br/>Hours later, Detective Harrison arrests Katherine. Tony kidnapped and attempted to murder Suzie. The police shot and killed Tony in a standoff. He was the town's serial killer. They hold Katherine overnight to question her. However, Detective Harrison determines he doesn't have enough evidence to charge Katherine with a crime and releases her.<br/><br/>Katherine returns home to a trashed house. She encounters Doreen while attempting to buy dinner and apologizes. To Katherine's surprise, Doreen appears at her front door with food. She extends an olive branch of sympathy. Katherine accepts because she needs a friend. Someone tossed a rock through her window with a threatening note before Doreen arrived. Doreen returns home and warns Suzie to leave Katherine alone. She recognized Suzie's handwriting on the note. Suzie can't believe her mother is helping her kidnapper's wife. Doreen tells Suzie she will understand everything when she's older. Until then, Doreen will continue to provide a comforting shoulder to Katherine throughout this tumultuous time. And Katherine will need it. Someone wants revenge for Tony's sins, and they will kill to get it.<br/><br/>This movie starts where others end. Suzie breaks free of Tony's clutches, and the police kill him within the first commercial break. The connection between Doreen and Katherine drives the movie's plot. As the story continues, viewers are unsure who's harassing Katherine. They assume she must have known, and they want to drive her out of town. This film will solve a mystery within an enigma and backtrack to clues you missed. The plot is original and saves this picture. The audience should give it a try.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sugarcreek Amish Mysteries: Blessing in Disguise",
    "review": "Cheryl left Chicago for Sugarcreek after her engagement ended with heartbreak. She will run her Aunt Mitzi's store while Mitzi is in New Guinea. Sugarcreek has a thriving Amish community that happily interacts with the English. Mitzi tells Cheryl that her best friend, Naomi, will show Cheryl around the store.<br/><br/>Cheryl arrives and meets Naomi and Naomi's daughter, Esther. Esther works in the store and can assist Cheryl. Later, Cheryl meets Ester's brother, Levi, and father, Seth. Cheryl's first day at the shop is tough, but Naomi promises that tomorrow will be better.<br/><br/>Cheryl and Naomi's family attend a grand re-opening of a local restaurant. Cheryl sees a customer, Rachel, with her husband, Samuel, and son, Jack, at the party. The diner's owner, Kathy, pulls Rachel aside to see her new oven. When Rachel returns, her baby is gone. Rachel screams. Chief Twitchell questions partygoers while Cheryl stealthily inspects the stroller. She spies blue paint on it and alerts Chief Twitchell. Chief Twitchell thanks Cheryl for the clue but warns her 'to leave the police work to him.' Cheryl abides by his order until the police arrest Levi. Now, Cheryl wants to use her love for True Crime to prove Levi's innocence. And she has an unforeseen ally, Naomi. Can these women find Jack, or will Levi go to jail?<br/><br/>Based on Blessing in Disguise and Where Hope Dwells, this film flawlessly combines two mysteries into one story. The first mystery is discovering the reverse robber. Someone is leaving handmade toys in Mitzi's shop. However, that pales in comparison to the kidnapping. While the plot is compelling, advanced viewers will uncover the culprit before the reveal. The acting is charming, while the script respects Amish culture. This film is a wholesome whodunit for the family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nurse practitioner Monica meets with her mother, Olivia, for lunch. Olivia can feel Monica's stress. Monica is upset because her hard work didn't pay off. She didn't get a highly coveted promotion. Olivia encourages Monica to take time off and participate in the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage.<br/><br/>Monica arrives in Spain and receives her pilgrim passport. She looks for her guide, Consuelo, but can't find her. Consuelo introduces Monica to her other travel mates, Ernesto, Ernesto's son, Luis, and Luis's son, Mateo. The three continue to bicker.<br/><br/>They walk the path, but Monica believes she can make better time alone and saunters ahead. She takes a moment to sit and falls backward, losing her shoe. The group catches up to her, and Mateo finds her shoe. Luis offers to put it on, but Monica says no. Then he asks if she ever lets someone help her. He grabs her shoe and puts it on her foot. Monica will spend the next 30 days connecting with his family in more ways than one by letting faith guide the way.<br/><br/>This DaySpring movie puts faith at the forefront while entertaining with a love story. People usually say, 'Enjoy the journey,' but Monica has that experience. Every step of the way, faith guides their journey. Monica does fall into the Hallmark standard of a woman who works too much. She differs because she doesn't go to a small town but on a spiritual 30-day walk. Also, the relationship between the three men is a unique storyline for Hallmark. The journey looks transcendent and will inspire others. The dialogue is average but heartfelt. This film should be shared and discussed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Desire: A Temptations Story",
    "review": "TV host Kendra concludes today's show and gets updates from her executive producer, best friend Natalie, and assistant, Emma, for tomorrow's taping. She then leaves the studio to visit her mother, Meredith, in the hospital. Meredith encourages Kendra to be strong because her time is near. Then, Meredith dies. Natalie found a refreshing spiritual retreat, and Emma booked the excursions. Natalie reminds Kendra that she must take her bodyguard, Charlie, because it's studio policy for international travel.<br/><br/>Kendra and Charlie arrive at the resort, and Charlie scans the room. Afterward, Kendra dismisses Charlie for the evening and sleeps. In the morning, Kendra goes to breakfast and spots Charlie across the restaurant. She asks the waitress to extend an invitation to Charlie, and he joins her. They share a laugh and food, but Kendra sees a handsome man sitting at another table. She recalls seeing him get out of a hot tub with a sexy physique.<br/><br/>Kendra and Charlie walk a trail. He encourages Kendra to walk ahead of him to receive the spiritual experience. Kendra strolls forward, and the handsome man, Malcolm, stumbles out of the woods. Within days, Malcolm and Kendra bond over grief, fall in love, get engaged, and marry. Charlie accepts their marriage to Kendra's face but believes something is wrong. He asks his friend, Ricky, to investigate Malcolm, his business, and his financials. Ricky thinks Charlie's fears stem from jealousy but moves forward with the investigation. Ricky returns with some harsh and frightening truths and alerts Charlie. Will Kendra believe Charlie, or will she choose Malcolm?<br/><br/>Before you get mad, listen to the opening sequence. Kendra admits she had a desperate desire for love. This moment of clarity gives the viewer a look into Kendra's redeeming quality. She takes accountability for her mistakes. The actors give a stellar performance with a mid-level script, and the sets are breathtaking. This movie feels like a Tyler Perry film with a Lifetime budget. Viewers should follow the protective Charlie to enjoy this film. Otherwise, Kendra's actions are infuriating.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
