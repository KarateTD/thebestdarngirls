Jay gushes over Hadley's accolades before taking her to the rental property.<br/><br/>Jay informs Hadley that the area is quiet and her closest neighbor, Frank, is miles away. Hadley tries to go to sleep but can't because of screaming and gunshots. Rain tells them the screaming is coming from Frank's goats, but she is unsure about the shots. Hadley calls the police. Detective Shawn Caden tells Hadley it's hunting season, and the mountains create an echo chamber.<br/><br/>Hadley leaves home to meet Dee at the diner and hears strange flapping. She finds a parachute on a tree with a dead jumper attached. The jumper is Sam. Shawn investigates, and the medical examiner makes a positive ID and declares the death a murder because Sam has a bullet wound. As Hadley updates Dee, Sam's mother, Steph, enters with a request. She wants Hadley to investigate the crime because Mystic police are short-staffed, and Hadley trained with actual officers. Hadley says yes and assembles her Clue Crew to help. They will look into Sam's life and use Hadley's expertise and hyperobservation skills to solve the crime, with Detective Shawn protecting and unknowingly guiding them.<br/><br/>This movie is an entertaining start to a new series.
