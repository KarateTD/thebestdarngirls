    "review":"Anne returns home to help her father close his toy shop.  Keith knocks on the door with his daughter Jesse.  She forgot to buy a toy for the gift exchange.  Jesse finds a wooden Santa Anne made years ago by hand.  Before a proper introduction could be made, Keith puts his foot in his mouth.  Later, Anne and Keith see each other at the town hall.
