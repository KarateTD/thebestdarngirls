    "review":"Judge Kim Wheeler is the traveling judge that presides over three courthouses in a 2500-square-mile radius in Nevada. The state added her latest district after a madam, Chris, found the judge, Jacob, dead in her brothel.<br/><br/>Kim spills coffee on her first day on the bench and asks her bailiff, Vicky, to clean it up. While it's highly irregular for a judge to start proceedings without a bailiff, Kim does it anyway. However, Kim proves to be strong enough to protect herself. A man attempts to attack Kim on the stand, and she hits him with her gavel. Someone captures the moment on camera, and it goes viral. Commenters nickname Kim 'The Hammer.' Before Kim leaves, her assistant, Jo, tells Kim that a case was left off her docket for Kirk Crawford. Kirk ran his best friend off the road because he dated Kirk's ex-girlfriend, and the friend died in the crash. Since the court is 126 miles away, Vicky and Kim will drive to town and sleep there.<br/><br/>Kim goes to the bar the night before the trial, and Kirk's dad, Bart Crawford, approaches her like a friendly snake while the bartender, Vance, watches. Kim tells Bart their interaction is improper and could affect the proceedings. Bart leaves with a tip of his hat as Vicky enters. Vicky gets a call that Jacob didn't have a heart attack. He died of a forced overdose. Later, Kim finds a note on her passenger seat with a dangerous warning. Someone wants Kim gone, like Jacob.<br/><br/>This movie has sex, drugs, and rock and roll. It's a funny mystery with dynamic characters that viewers will sink their teeth into while watching. Each character has a rich and complex backstory that resonates off the screen. With this small-town dynamic and tough-as-nails judge, this film is a series in the making. It's definitely worth a permanent place on your DVR. Be ready to find your new guilty pleasure. And to Lifetime: Make another ASAP.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Michelle and her daughter, Norah, move into the top floor of a condo. Their maintenance man, Lawrence, walks in without an invitation and without knocking to complain about the noise. Helene and her daughter, Channing, walk into the apartment as Michelle and Lawrence's conversation heats up. Channing and Norah talk and discover they will attend the same school. Channing sees Norah's pills and offers her MDMA, but Norah informs Channing that she takes medication for crippling migraines and turns down the offer.<br/><br/>Channing introduces Norah to Amanda, Aiden, and Griffin before school. Amanda pulls Norah aside and tells Norah to watch out for Channing. Channing changed since her parents got divorced. Norah goes throughout her day trying to stay on Channing's good side. But when she beats Channing during a track tryout, Channing's claws come out.<br/><br/>Michelle comes home after work to see a man, Josh, standing at the door. Josh is the building contractor and is there to fix Michelle's condo issues. They get along swimmingly, and Josh asks her out on a date. Michelle tells Josh maybe, and he leaves. Michelle and Norah believe their home is a fresh start until they see Michelle's car in the morning. Someone keyed it and left a threatening note. Michelle thinks Lawrence did it because someone reported his behavior to the condo board. But Norah thinks Channing did it as payback for Aiden. Michelle refuses to leave because their entire savings is in the condo. Someone is willing to kill Norah and Michelle for their ultimate plan.<br/><br/>There is more than meets the eye with this plot. The writers keep you guessing with so many people behaving poorly. Helene defends Channing with her fist, Channing drops beer bottles, and someone attacks Norah with a car. The suspects will give the viewers whiplash. This movie is a real roller coaster. There are crazy loops and twists, but you walk away feeling 'that's the end?'<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Olivia waits patiently outside for her fianc√©, Jack, to introduce her to his mother, Amanda. Olivia works at a CPA firm representing Jack's family company, Intex. Amanda excuses herself and makes a private call to her brother, Victor, who owns Intex. Victor agreed with Amanda that the relationship happened too fast. He worries Olivia could be a spy, so he asks his assistant, Stan, to look into Olivia, her company, and her background. That's not enough for Amanda. Amanda believes Jack's ex-girlfriend, Rachel, is better suited for Jack. So, Amanda hires a private investigator to follow Olivia. Then, Amanda contacts Rachel's mom, Caroline, to help reignite Rachel and Jack's romance, but Caroline tells Amanda to back off.<br/><br/>Olivia and Amanda meet for coffee, but Olivia can see that Amanda's attitude toward her hasn't changed.

Olivia goes home to complete her report, and someone breaks into her home and strangles her into a coma. Someone is out for Olivia and will try again to murder her.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of moving parts because its two storylines in one. With everything going on, Jack is one of the few wonderful Lifetime husbands that stands beside Olivia. The character development throughout the movie is believable and well-written. The ending leaves the story open for a part two that is shocking.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Alex cooks a 5-star breakfast for her dog, Radar, and grabs a protein bar for herself. Her sister, Sarah, tells Alex to date, but Alex is too busy. She trains dogs and volunteers at the local animal shelter. As Alex and Sarah walk through the park, they see a man, Simon, fussing with a dog. Alex jumps in front of the dog and firmly tells the dog to sit. Simon runs over and thanks Alex for helping him. Alex asks Simon for the dog's name, and Simon says the dog's name is Simon. Simon's friend, Chloe, returns to see her dog, Simon, calm. She thinks Simon worked a miracle.<br/><br/>Simon meets with Chloe later for a fancy dinner and brings flowers. However, Simon attacks him and rips the flowers to shreds. Chloe doesn't want to go out because her dog is upset. Simon believes he must get through to the dog before he can date Chloe. He finds Alex in the park and spills coffee on her. Simon sees the shelter flyers in Alex's hand when Simon tries to clean her. He asks her to train Simon in exchange for better posters because he works for an ad agency. Alex tells Simon no.<br/><br/>Alex walks to her favorite coffee stand with Sarah, and the barista hands her a note from Simon with his number. She calls Simon later and offers to help him train Chloe's dog to win Chloe's heart. What will Alex do when Simon starts to win her heart?<br/><br/>Based on The Dog Lover's Guide to Dating: Using Cold Noses to Find Warm Hearts by Deborah Wood, this film offers helpful advice about dogs and how that advice parallels relationships. Simon's pursuit of Chloe would be considered creepy on any other station. But Hallmark makes it kind and funny. Alex has trust issues because her father abandoned their family. And a round of applause for Sarah. For a little sister, she is wise beyond her years and scary when necessary. This film is a cute movie to kick off the new year but very predictable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hannah is on edge because she got into Kenzer University, an ivy league school, but she still waits to hear if she got a scholarship. Principal Edwards calls Hannah into the office. Hannah was one of eleven applicants, and she got it. Hannah's friends, Scott and Jane, take her bowling to celebrate and unwind. Jane tells Hannah about a new app called Clique. Jane makes Hannah a profile. After bowling, Hannah senses someone following her and turns to see Eli. He blames Hannah for not getting the scholarship because he was the second in line. When Eli gets hostile, Scott defends Hannah.<br/><br/>Hannah starts talking to a cute guy named James on the app. James seems nice, but Hannah notices that he knows things she isn't telling him. Then Principal Edwards wants to see Hannah again. Hannah's teacher claimed she plagiarized her latest paper. Principal Edwards has to warn the scholarship committee about Hannah's infraction because they can't prove she didn't do it. Hannah panics and needs to find who set her up before she loses her scholarship. But looking under that rock will put Hannah's life in danger.<br/><br/>The title is misleading because only one person dies. This movie introduces several suspects, including Hannah's new love interest, Kevin, and eliminates them one by one. The backing track for this movie is one of the best in a Lifetime film, and it helps viewers feel the suspense and fear. Yes, the story did leave an opening for part two.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
