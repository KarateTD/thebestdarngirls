    "mtitle":"Keyshia Cole: This is My Story",
    "review":"Keyshia Cole runs home after spending time with her boyfriend, Jamal, in 1997. Her adoptive mother, Yvonne, scolds Keyshia for being out with a boy while her adoptive father, Leon, keeps his distance. She sees money in Keyshia's hands and knows what Keyshia wants to do. Keyshia leaves under a veil of threats and looks for her mother, Frankie. Later, Keyshia finds her mother and takes her to dinner to ensure Frankie spends money on food, not drugs. Keyshia returns home, but Yvonne refuses to let Keyshia back inside.<br/><br/>After months of living with her sister, Neffe, Keyshia goes to a church and asks the congregation to pray for her career. Keyshia receives a check from the state for $14,000 and decides to use it to go to Los Angeles to pursue her dream. Keyshia looks for Frankie and begs Frankie to come with her. Frankie tells Keyshia to get settled first, then send for her. Keyshia heads to Los Angeles with a dream of recording an album. Keyshia's dream will come true, but she will suffer through family issues, reality tv, anxiety, and failed relationships.<br/><br/>This movie follows Keyshia through her struggles in Los Angeles. Each time she wanted to give up, something beautiful came her way. But nothing was easy. This movie needed another hour to focus on Keyshia and her career. Like her reality tv shows, the film's plot centered on the family. This story is as much about Frankie as it is about Keyshia. However, it helps viewers gain compassion for families coping with a loved one's addiction.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"My Husband's Worst Mistake",
    "review":"Amy and Kent decide to skip the dinner after a grueling real estate seminar and hit the bar. They sleep together after too many drinks and agree to keep it quiet. They could lose their jobs and spouses. They go to their homes in the evening, and Amy's husband, Brad, questions Amy. Amy lies about her whereabouts and receives a text from 'K.' Brad demands to see the message and reads it. It breaks her lie apart, and Amy tells Brad about the affair with Kent. Enraged, Brad pushes Amy down the stairs and kills her.<br/><br/>Kent goes to a sullen workplace and asks his co-worker, Miguel, what's wrong. Miguel tells Kent their boss, Jackie, emailed about Amy's death. Later, Kent finds a compromising photo of him and Amy on the windshield of his car. Kent runs to Miguel's office to confront him. Miguel blackmails Kent to give up his promotion, or Miguel will release the photo. Kent arrives home to admit his affair and the blackmailing scheme to his wife, Sarah, with Lucy unknowingly listening. Sarah decides to focus her energy on her job and Lucy. But Brad won't let that happen. Brad believes Kent should pay for Amy's death and is on the road to vengeance.<br/><br/>Once again, every character sucks in this film. Amy and Kent are pathetic for cheating. Brad is a controlling killer, and Lucy doesn't know how to stay in a child's place. Although, she does save the day. Surprisingly, this movie has an intelligent cop for 15 minutes. Sarah is the only redeemable character in this film. Viewers will want Sarah to leave this family and never return. The plot is wild, but the ending is flatter than paper. This movie is a way to kill 2 hours, but you shouldn't waste space on your DVR.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Secret Sauce",
    "review":"Laura recommended her company, Superior, sponsor J and P's barbecue contest to her boss, Gary, months ago. Gary says J and P agreed to the sponsorship, and the conference is to introduce Laura as the spearhead. Gary walks away, and Laura jumps into a meeting room to happy dance while singing her praises. She hears someone behind her clear his throat and sees a man on the conference monitor. He introduces himself as Jim from J and P, and Laura assumes he works in marketing. Laura pleads with Jim not to tell Gary about the dance or hopeful promotion. He vows to keep her secret.<br/><br/>Gary formally introduces Laura to Jim, the CEO of J and P.. Gary wants Laura to travel to St. George and discover what made J and P and their secret sauce go viral. Uncomfortably, Jim agrees to show Laura around and learn about the contest. After disconnecting the call, Gary tells Laura to learn J and P's secret sauce recipe so they can mass produce it under the Superior brand. If they get the sauce, they will compensate Jim, his restaurant, and his future contests.<br/><br/>Jim tells his hostess, Tara, that Laura is coming to oversee the contest. Tara spots Laura outside and invites Laura to a meal. She loves it and asks for the recipe, but Jim says no because it's a family secret. Then, Laura asks Jim to put Superior's sponsorship banner outside the restaurant. Jim is apprehensive about change. Jim says he will consider Laura's idea, but she must learn to appreciate the beauty of barbecue: low and slow. Can Laura get Jim to reconsider, or will Gary have other plans for Jim and his sauce?<br/><br/>This movie starts and continues with the expected plot. A high-fashion, big-city, and job-oriented woman comes to a small town to change a stern man and his family's business. However, love changes them both for the better. The audience shouldn't give up on this movie because the resolution makes Laura a boss with the moves of a CEO. And that slight twist saves the movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Wedding Contract",
    "review":"It's been months since teacher Rebecca tripped ad executive Adam at the park. They fell head over heels in love, and now Rebecca wants Adam to come to Shabbat Dinner to meet her family. Rebecca thinks Adam is the one and hopes he will propose. Adam comes to Sadie and Jacob's home bearing gifts for the whole family. He enjoys dinner with her family because he lost his family's traditions after his widowed mother, Dianne, remarried. Today, Dianne is divorced and focuses on her career. During dinner, Sadie and Jacob have a playful tiff, and she reminds Jacob of his agreement in their wedding contract. They explain its purpose to Adam and hope Rebecca will keep the tradition. A few days later, Adam proposes to Rebecca, and they look forward to getting married and spending their lives together. But are they ready? Planning their wedding will test their relationship, in-laws, and careers.<br/><br/>Happily ever after is only in fairy tales. Rebecca and Adam come down from their love high after meeting with the Rabbi and answering questions about their relationship. Then Dianne arrives and clashes with Sadie. Rebecca deals with the dueling mothers while Adam works. Finally, Adam gets a promotion that will force him to move to L.A. after the wedding. While this movie is hilarious, it has authentic issues in a marriage. The plot isn't the usual Hallmark fluff. It focuses on the challenges of becoming a couple maturely. The audience should watch and use the film to spark a necessary conversation.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
