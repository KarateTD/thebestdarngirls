    "mtitle": "Held Hostage in My House",
    "review": "Charlie doesn't want to go camping with his father, Matt, and Matt's girlfriend, Kate, but Charlie's mother, Dawn, tells Charlie to give Kate a chance. Dawn goes through her guest list and checks her guesthouse before check-in. She steps on fire ants before entering her home. Charlie reluctantly gets in Matt's car, and Matt pulls Dawn aside to talk. He wants Dawn to quit her art career and work a regular job. Dawn's anger boils over because Matt recently got sober and acts like a model dad but doesn't offer financial support. He threatens to sue for full custody if she doesn't get a job.<br/><br/>Dawn calls her best friend, Victoria, for moral support. Victoria invites Dawn on a trip like they did in Dawn's single days. Dawn says no. Victoria doesn't think a judge will side with Matt. Dawn sighs, bids farewell to Victoria, and goes home to greet her guest. However, she doesn't know they canceled. Dawn sees the guesthouse's front door open and assumes the guest came early. She enters and tries to alert them, but someone hits her on the head with a vase. Dawn wakes up with her arms and feet bound to her bed. She prays someone finds her before her attacker kills her.<br/><br/>This movie pushes its viewers in a 'Lifetime' direction with Matt and Dawn's looming custody battle. So, the audience will wonder why the script takes them down memory lane. As the fire ants sting Dawn, she starts to hallucinate. The flashback will return full circle, although they seem irrelevant at first. Viewers must be patient and attentive. And thank goodness for Charlie. He saves the day for his mom. This film isn't about Dawn's escape but her sleuthing skills. This picture features stunning artwork and respectfully credits the artist Valentina Sarfeh. Valentina's work is breathtaking. This movie takes a long way to become entertaining. However, it pays off if you wait.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Past Comes Knocking",
    "review": "After running into her daughter, Autumn, Professor Susan goes to a diner for lunch. Her teaching assistant, Jane, went missing three weeks ago, and the police haven't found her. Sadly, they called off the search. The waitress, Zoe, overhears Susan talking about it and shares her condolences. Zoe recognizes Susan from Susan's book. The book covered Attorney General Vincent Darte and his crimes. He ended his life after the book's release, and it caused a ripple effect among Vincent's family and victims. Zoe admits she wanted to take Susan's course but transferred too late to register. Susan will gladly add Zoe to the class if Zoe likes it.<br/><br/>Susan teaches the class as Zoe arrives late. After class, Zoe apologizes and blames her tardiness on work. Susan allows Zoe to come to class but as a teaching assistant. Zoe jumps at the chance to work for her idol. Susan asks Zoe to meet at Susan's home to converse.<br/><br/>Zoe arrives, meets Autumn, and reminds Susan about her date with Professor Thomas. Zoe returns home after a great night out and finds the door open. She searches through the home and finds a mess. Susan calls Zoe and hears Zoe's phone ring under paperwork. Then, Susan calls the police.<br/><br/>Detective Marissa arrives and doesn't hide her disdain for Susan. She remembers Zoe is the 2nd assistant to go missing. Marissa informs Susan they will investigate and believes the evidence will point to Susan. Susan thinks someone is framing her by making her assistants disappear. Susan must dig into her journalism past before Detective Marissa pins the crimes on her.<br/><br/>Where to start? This movie begins with someone chasing a pretty girl through the woods. She falls and dies. Then, viewers get a few poorly manufactured wigs that are hard to ignore. Susan has an unnecessary love interest, and the ending is anticlimactic. Also, Susan doesn't keep her personal and professional lives separate. These enormous mistakes make viewers lose interest in Susan's well-being. Lifetimers can skip this movie. It is a slow burn to nowhere.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Twisted Neighbor",
    "review": "Colleen's mom, Vanessa, doesn't understand why Colleen left New York for a cul-de-sac called Sunny Vista. Colleen walks home from the market as the neighbors take notice of the newcomer. Her bag rips open, and the contents fall on the street. Quinn picks up an item while saying hello but leaves Colleen to finish the retrieval. Dan runs over with a box to contain the food as Jared watches. Jared's wife, Kimberly, chats about Colleen with her friend Ashton on the neighborhood app. They attempt to learn about Colleen's marital status and job. Jillian, the H.O.A. president, forcefully reminds Colleen that the H.O.A. is having a meeting tonight and suggests Colleen change clothes.<br/><br/>The H.O.A. meets at Theo's home, and everyone gives Colleen the third degree. After the meeting, Colleen gets notifications from the neighborhood app. As Colleen reads other messages, she sees everyone discussing Edith's unkempt property. Colleen bakes a pie and walks to Edith's to offer cleaning help. She finds Edith dead with a fireplace poker in her abdomen.<br/><br/>Colleen collects herself at home when she sees movement at her back door. She calls the police and grabs a rolling pin. To Colleen's surprise, it's Theo with a jar of sauce. He disclosed that he has mushrooms, and they get high. Colleen wants to tell Theo about her past, but he receives a message. An anonymous texter accuses him of selling smut. Theo says he knows the caller and leaves to confront them but promises to return. Colleen comes down from her high in the morning, but Theo never returns. Days later, Colleen finds Theo's mangled body. Neighbors worry that Colleen is the killer because she was the last person with Theo. Can Colleen clear her name and find the culprit before another person dies?<br/><br/>Where to start? You should watch this film if you want a funny and unhinged movie. The mystery is compelling and gives viewers an unforeseeable culprit. After Colleen takes drugs, you won't be sure if she's still hallucinating these events. And you have to assume Edith's killer is the person wearing the mask. They never explicitly say who killed her. This movie has drugs, affairs, murders, and BDSM. Viewers should watch this movie with a glass of wine and a good sense of humor.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
