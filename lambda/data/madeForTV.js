    "review":"Nikki moves to a small town with her daughter, Brooke, and gets lost.  As they try to recalculate their GPS, Gavin, the coffee shop owner, helps them. Brooke sees a cute dress in a store window and convinces Nikki to go inside in try it on.  After putting her foot in her mouth, Nikki gets a job offer from the store's owner, Liz. Liz has a 15-year-old daughter named Anna.  On Nikki's first day, Liz takes Nikki out to talk, and they run into Gavin. Liz tells Nikki that she dated Gavin and warns Nikki to be careful of his clingy ways. As she leaves, Nikki spies Liz arguing with Anna's father, Dan, about custody arrangements. The next day, Gavin asks Nikki on a date, but she worries about Liz's feelings.  Liz gives Nikki the greenlight, and Gavin and Nikki go out.  When Gavin tries to kiss Nikki, she pumps the brakes.  She thinks they are moving too fast, and he agrees to slow down.  But that doesn't last long.  He buys plane tickets, buys an expensive necklace, and asks Nikki to move in.  Soon, Nikki breaks things off.  One night, Anna comes to Nikki's house because Liz never picked her up. Nikki goes to the store to check and finds a mess behind an unlocked door.  Liz's phone is there, but Liz is missing.  Nikki will do anything to find her new friend, even put her life on the line.<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn to a predictable ending.  The abductor has so many red flags that you will spend most of the time wondering how Nikki keeps missing them. And to make matters worse, you will fume when Nikki takes custody of Anna away from Dan.  That's just too far.  While the acting is decent, the script is a dud.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

Well, you can watch Rachel unpack the mystery. This movie is background noise.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
