    "mtitle":"Wrath: A Seven Deadly Sins Story",
    "review":"Chastity won a $147 million settlement for her client.  Although she thinks it should be 200 million, her friend, Melanie, wants to celebrate.  Melanie thinks Chastity should date more and approaches a man at the bar for her.  Xavier, a lawyer, charms Chastity until one o'clock in the morning.<br/><br/>After a month of dating, Chastity tells Xavier she needs to make herself scarce and focus on work.  Xavier goes silent over the phone, but he pretends to understand.  After the week without her, Xavier gets the urge to propose.  Chastity thinks Xavier is sweet and drunk, so she says no.  He laughs it off, but his fury grows.<br/><br/>Xavier shows up late to lunch and sees Chastity talking to a man at her table.  Chastity explains that the man is Roger, her high school sweetheart.  Xavier sits down after Roger leaves.  He believes Roger still has feelings for Chastity.<br/><br/>Roger tries to cover up a mistake at work and almost gets fired.  He flashes into a fit of rage and smashes Chastity's phone.  Later, Xavier replaces it.  But Chastity warns him that his wrath will end their relationship if he loses his temper again.  Chastity has only scratched the surface.  Xavier is a danger to Chastity, her family, her dog, and himself.<br/><br/>Based on Wrath by Victoria Christopher Murray, this film differs from Envy and Lust because the lead isn't the sin-bearer.  She is the victim of sin.  Xavier tries to apologize, victim blame, and gaslight Chastity every time she attempts to leave him.  This manipulation works until his anger becomes violent.  Within six weeks, Xavier goes from a nice guy to a rage-filled monster with a history of violence.  Although he is the source of wrath, Chastity is the bearer of forgiveness.  And that's the takeaway from this film.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Curious Caterer: Dying for Chocolate",
    "review":"Goldy got her first job catering the luncheon for the Elk Park Prep fundraiser.  Goldy makes beignets and chocolate-covered shortbread while her friend Laura watches.  When Laura tries to have a serious conversation, Brian walks into the kitchen.  Brian is Goldy's daughter's teacher and Goldy's crush.  He recommended Goldy for the job to Adele.  Adele is a wealthy member of the community and married to Archie.  Goldy makes her rounds at the fundraiser and runs into her ex-husband, Dr. Richard, the minority investor in the Elk Park Wellness Center.  He tells Goldy not to worry because Archie and Dr. Owen are investors also.  Laura pulls Goldy aside and asks Goldy to come to her home later to discuss something she discovered.<br/><br/>Outside, Brian sees a suspicious man talking on the phone.  He's Julian, Adele's son from her 1st marriage and Brian's former student. Then, Marla sees Richard talking to Laura in the parking lot.  It looked heated, so Marla walked away.<br/><br/>On the way home, a traffic jam stops Goldy from proceeding.  She calls Officer Mason to her car.  Mason tells Goldy a vehicle ran off the cliff.  As she tries to get more information, she can hear the dispatch officer say Laura is the registered car owner over Mason's walkie-talkie.  Goldy panics and runs out of her car to check on Laura, but Detective Tom stops her.  He tells Goldy they have one body down there, and he doesn't want two.  When Goldy hears the word body, she knows Laura is dead.  When Goldy looks like the killer, she will investigate her friends and pry into Laura's secrets to find out what happened and why.<br/><br/>Based on Catering to Nobody and Dying for Chocolate by Diane Mott Davidson, this movie is a solid contender for your new favorite series.  Goldy's job gives her an excuse to be at crime scenes.  As the title claims, she is a curious caterer, not an amateur sleuth.  Set your DVR for this film; you will want to watch it twice.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Royal Runaway Romance",
    "review":"After a whirlwind romance with her painter, Wes, Princess Amelia wants to see him again.  However, Wes lives in Chicago, and she lives in Bundbury.  She approaches her mother, Queen Ava, about Wes, but Ava thinks Wes is not the right man for Amelia.  Then, Amelia remembers her uncle, Andreas, is having a birthday soon, and he lives in LA.  Andreas convinces the queen to let Amelia come to LA along with Amelia's lady in waiting, Camille.<br/><br/>Ava, Amelia, and Camille arrive in LA, and Andreas introduces them to Grady.  Grady is Andreas's head of security.  Andreas has assigned Grady to watch over Camille for her stay.  Since Ava took Amelia and Camille's passports, they know that flying is not an option.  So, Amelia resorts to thievery.  She steals Grady's keys and waits for daylight.  Then, she sees Grady in the passenger seat and screams.  He knew she took his keys, and he got Andreas's approval to take her to Chicago on a road trip.  Amelia will learn the difference between passion and love on the trip.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see where this trip will lead for Grady and Amelia, so the overarching love story isn't attention-grabbing.  However, the side stories are compelling.  Amelia uses this trip to help Grady mend family bonds and his broken heart.  Also, you see that Ava is a benevolent future queen.  This film is like most road trips.  The destination isn't the best part; it's the journey.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
