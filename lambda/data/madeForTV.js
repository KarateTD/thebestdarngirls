    "review":"Jade comes home from shopping with her sister, Leigh, and bought a sexy red dress to celebrate her award along with co-workers.  Before the party, Jade gets ready and puts on the dress, but her husband, Ed, cut it up.  Ed tells her the dress makes her look trashy. Ed notices Liam, Jade's co-worker, hug her and whisper in her ear, and he is furious.  Later that night, Ed accuses Jade of embarrassing him and beats her. Jade can't take the abuse and controlling behavior.  She packs up her clothes, their daughter, Kayla, and some cash and leaves.  After several attempts to get her back, Ed finally signs the divorce papers. Jade believes the hard times are behind her.  After work, Jade drops her car keys.  She attempts to pick them up when a man approaches her and points a gun in her face.  He runs when he hears potential witnesses.  Jade knows Ed, who is at a conference in another state, sent the hitman. Jade doesn't think anyone will believe her because Ed is a respected heart surgeon with ties to the community.  After his conference, Ed visits Jade's home and finds signs of a struggle and blood.  He calls the police, and they label Jade a missing person. When Ed gets home, he calls the hitman and tells him to get rid of Jade's body.  With Jade gone, Ed is free to raise their daughter, work, and get his final win over Jade.  But is she gone, because her ghost is haunting him?<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect kick-off for the 'Ripped From The Headlines' season.  Based on the story of Noela Rukundo, Jade committed pseudocide to gain control of her life.  In these movies, the antagonist makes the protagonist feel crazy, but this movie flips that script on its head. While watching this movie, take note of the mental abuse along with the physical.  When anyone gives Jade praise, she quickly puts herself down in comparison to Ed. These acts are signs of long term abuse.  So sit back, drink some tea, and learn.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Galentine's Day Nightmare",
    "review":"Claire gets dressed while video calling her friend, Tiffany.  Tiffany convinced Claire to go out on February 13th to celebrate Galentine's Day. Brian walks over and introduces himself, especially to Claire.  Tiffany and Sophia walk to the ladies' room, leaving Claire at the table alone. Brian asks Claire to go with him to someplace close and special. They gaze at the beautiful view, and at the stroke of midnight, they kiss for Valentine's Day.  When Claire gets back to her table, she sees Tiffany and Sophia left her. Seeing she is in need, Brian offers to give her a ride home.  Soon, they are in Claire's bed.  The next day, Claire wakes up to chocolates and a card on her pillow.  These gifts are a great start to her day because she is meeting her new boss, Margaret. Margaret schedules lunch for them at the restaurant that Claire celebrated Galentine's.  Claire walks into the bistro and sees Brian standing their talking to a patron.  She gives a friendly hello before Margaret walks in and kisses Brian.  Brian and Margaret are married. She declares to never talk to Brian again.  Later, Claire goes for a run to clear her mind and crosses paths with Brian.  She considers running away, but he blurts out that he is divorcing Margaret. Feeling like things are on track, Claire visits Brian at the bistro, but he yells at her to leave and stop stalking him. Claire can't understand his sudden change and goes home with more questions than answers.  Her next day at work only adds more questions when someone finds Margaret dead from stab wounds.  When they find out about Claire's affair with Brian, find her fingerprints on the weapon, and find out about her dangerous past, Claire becomes their number one suspect.  How could she not be? Brian made sure she would.<br/><br/>With a plot close to a Dateline episode, this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat.  Yes, the lead character makes all the typical mistakes, but the villain will keep you watching.  Brian uses technology, gossip, and pure charisma to bring everyone on his side. This movie doesn't do a lot of monologuing to explain why Brian does these things. This film is a great movie that needs your full attention from beginning to end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
