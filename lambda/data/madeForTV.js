    "review":"Tanya wakes up in a hospital bed with one question on her mind, \"Where's Jake\".  Her nurse informs her that Jake, the co-pilot, died in the plane crash.  Miraculously, she, the pilot survived.  Years later, Tanya is a flight instructor. One student introduces himself as Jake Sherman.  Tanya believes her Jake has come back to her and she starts to fixate on him.  She uses this time to get to know him better.  Jake tells Tanya his wife, Annie, and his mother-in-law, Margaret, are against him learning to fly. Tanya starts to flirt and they kiss.  Jake stops and says he can't, he is a married man. She decides Jake is hers.  She will flirt, manipulate, and kill to have Jake all to herself.<br/><br/>Wow! Tanya takes nuts to a whole new level.  She is a mix of Seven with Throw Momma From the Train and a bit of Basic Instinct.  Your heart will skip a bit when she takes Annie and Jake for a flight.  However, you will experience mixed emotions for Margaret's inflight instructions. And you must watch it for yourself to enjoy the skilled writing and forethought that went into this script.  This movie has a great resolution.  Although, there could be a part two with some creative writing.  This is a fun and adult watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

And it comes early in the movie too.  Mark is sweet in the beginning, but Gina never checked his references.  So you know something bad will happen. It's just strange to see it happen so fast.  After 1 day with Gina, he is obsessed.  And it's nothing she does for or to him, it's everything he does for her. You would expect the obsession to go the other way around.  This movie gives the viewers a good dish of crazy but no real cause for the obsession.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
