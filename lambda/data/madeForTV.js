    "review":"The moment Courtney lays eyes on Nicole's son, Jason, she thinks he would be perfect for her landscaping company.  Originally rejecting the offer, Jason accepts when he needs more money to impress a girl.  The day Jason accepts Courtney's job offer, they have sex.  The next day, she texts Jason a new client.  Jason is shocked when the client openly comes on to him.  Jason rushes to tell Courtney and she reveals the truth.  Her landscaping company is a front for her real business: A Madam.  After talking to one of Courtney's boys, Jason settles into becoming a gigolo.  When it gets dangerous, can Jason get out?<br/><br/>This movie tries to be too many things at once.   It attempts to be a mystery, a Lifetime movie, and a guilty pleasure at the same time.  With so many potential plots, the overall storyline falls through the cracks.  This movie's only saving grace is the performances.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Melanie worries she will get fired.  However, she is given a promotion.  Her first task is to hire an assistant to help her.  At first, she is steadfast on one candidate until she meets Phoebe.  While Melanie believes Phoebe is too old for the job, Phoebe says all the right buzzwords to get her in the door.  At first, the working relationship between Phoebe and Melanie runs smoothly.  However, Phoebe starts blurring the lines between work and home.  When Melanie tries to set her straight, Phoebe starts to pull her life apart.  Can Melanie convince everyone else of Phoebe's sick intention before she loses everything?<br/><br/>This mundane Lifetime movie takes a classic Lifetime plot and does nothing new.  It doesn't use new technology, new jobs, new motives, or new weapons.  If you are going to use a Lifetime plot, give it something new for the viewer.  Otherwise, its just background noise.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"In Broad Daylight",
    "review":"After handing her son to a childcare professional, Jordan is kidnapped in broad daylight.  Her family worries Jordan was another victim of the man who kidnapped Ophelia Baker.  But Jordan's cousin, Malik, is keeping a secret.  He believes it was Jordan's ex and father of her child, Steve.  While Jordan's family know she had a restraining order against Steve, they believe the two were on good terms.  Malik knows Steve was abusive and stalking Jordan.  Jordan's attempts to keep family out of her business has clouded their judgment.  Now, to save Jordan's life, Malik has to do the one thing he promised not to do: break her confidence.  Can they save Jordan in time?<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, this movie not only covers the physical side of abuse, but it also covers the psychological as well.  Under the guise of caring for her, Steve moves her away from family, keeps her isolated, and convinces her to leave her job.  On the other hand, before they met, Jordan took the blame for her past relationship failures.  While she is a strong woman, consistently taking the blame makes her prey.  For a 2-hour movie, these characters are well written and have incredible depth.  They are expertly acted to convey every emotion in an abusive relationship.  In seconds, Steve is loving, scary, and loving all over again.  As the relationship hits a downward spiral, you can see the light fade from Jordan's eyes as she flinches at Steve's touches.  While Steve is abusive to Jordan, the movie is careful not to portray him as completely evil.  He continues to be a loving and caring father to his son and his reason for control is given in great detail.  This is one to watch over again and discuss.  By the way, do you know any Barbeque Babies?<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sins of a Father",
    "review":"Detective Felicia sits across a sweet, young man who killed his stepmother.  She doesn't believe he did it alone but he won't talk to her.  His mother, Mrs. Banks, explains that Robert is under the thumb of a manipulative con-artist: His father, Pastor Clarence.  Her parents helped Clarence legally take Robert from her because they disapproved of her sexuality.  Once Robert moved in with Clarence and Karen, she never heard or saw her son until now.  She believes Robert pulled the trigger but Clarence put the murder plot in his hands, mind, and heart.  Now, Detective Felicia has to make Robert do the unthinkable: Turn against his father.<br/><br/>This movie is a study in nature vs. nurture.  Reminiscent of the Cinnamon Brown case, Clarence will manipulate anyone to win.  He commits all the seven deadly sins and sees the 10 commandments as instructions.  The script falls flat but the superb acting saves this film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After stealing another doctor's identity, Dr. Beck is working at a sleep study clinic.  His first patient, Michelle, came to the sleep clinic after her last sleepwalking episode of sexsomnia went viral.  Dr. Beck can't wait to help her.  But his focus shifts when he learns Michelle's niece, Nikki, suffers from sleepwalking, too.  Unlike her aunt, Nikki is highly suggestible when she sleepwalks.  Dr. Beck wants to get Michelle out of the way so Nikki can fall in love with him.  Then, he will be a peace.<br/><br/>The 4th installment of the series is the craziest to date.  It starts to become dizzying after the real world and Dr. Beck's imaginary world blur.  While this movie ended like a lot of other Lifetime movies, Dr. Beck may find his way to a 5th movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
