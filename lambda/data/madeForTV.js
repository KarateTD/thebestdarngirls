    "mtitle": "The Girl Who Wasn't Dead",
    "review": "Detective Richards returns Erica to Erica's mother, Carrie, after finding Erica in a hotel with her boyfriend, Andrew, 3 days after Erica ran away. Cassie explains that Erica is 15 while Andrew is 21. Cassie asks Richards to press charges against Andrew. Erica runs to her room to sulk.<br/><br/>Erica meets her friend, Liam, at school. She feels smothered by Cassie and the rules and thinks the age difference is unfair for true love. Liam sees Erica ditch school to see Andrew. She wants to plan more time together, but Andrew breaks up with her. Erica sobs and walks home.<br/><br/>Erica enters and finds her parents with Liam. Liam told them she left school early. Her father, Dan, takes her phone and berates her before she runs upstairs. Cassie instructs Dan to leave and talks to Erica. She wants to mend her relationship and have an open dialog. Erica cries and tells Cassie they broke up. Cassie consoles her daughter.<br/><br/>For a month, Erica is the model daughter and student. Cassie breathes a sigh of relief until Erica doesn't come home. Cassie doesn't believe Erica ran away again because they were getting along. Also, Cassie saw reports about missing girls on the news. She worries Erica could be another victim. After a thinly veiled threat from Cassie, Richards conducts a press conference asking for people to look for Erica. Cassie will get answers to her questions about Erica's disappearance, but will she like them?<br/><br/>Well, someone should slap this spoiled brat across the face. Erica didn't receive a harsh enough punishment for putting her family and friends through the worst possible scenario. She got the life she wanted and didn't learn anything. Erica was a spoiled brat at home and another when she was away. The film shows the family's perspective after Erica's disappearance. Then, it rewinds to display Erica's view. She deserves nothing but a spanking. This movie was infuriating.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Sprinkle of Deceit: A Hannah Swensen Mystery",
    "review": "Hannah prepares treats for Lonnie's reunion party. Hannah's mother, Delores, tries to manufacture a flirty conversation between Hannah and Prosecuting Attorney Chad. Delores gets a call that a studio is shooting a commercial in their small town, so she grabs Hannah to check out the set.<br/><br/>They arrive to see an actress screaming about an extra tripping her. The director, David, fails at calming the actress, and she storms off. He hires Delores on the spot.<br/><br/>At the police station, Detective Lonnie pulls Chad aside and updates Chad on an online stalker case. Darcy claims her former boss, Glen, has been harassing her over text. Lonnie got the case. However, he worries there will be a conflict of interest because he knows Darcy. Chad advises Lonnie to fill out the proper forms and continue working.<br/><br/>Hannah bakes for the party while her sister, Michelle, and Michelle's boyfriend, Lonnie, mingle. Lonnie introduces Michelle to his friends, B and B owners Cassie and Brian. Cassie and Brian praise Hannah's delectable treats to Michelle while Darcy stumbles toward them. After an uncomfortable conversation with Lonnie and Michelle, Darcy teeters away with her boyfriend, Adam. Adam breaks up with Darcy and leaves. Hannah recognized Darcy as the extra from the commercial. Hannah worries because a drunk Darcy doesn't have a ride home. To determine who will drive Darcy home, Lonnie, Cassie, and Brian play Rock Paper Scissors. And Lonnie loses.<br/><br/>Lonnie calls Hannah in the morning to say thank you again. He took Darcy home, put her in bed, locked Darcy's door, and threw the keys through the cat door. Hannah makes her hangover-cure smoothies and brings them to Darcy's home. She and Melissa enter the house and find Darcy in bed dead. Hannah doesn't worry until the coroner declares Darcy's death a homicide. Lonnie was the last person to see Darcy alive. So, the police make him the number one suspect. Hannah knows Lonnie isn't a murderer, so she vows to find the real culprit.<br/><br/>Based on Coconut Layer Cake Murder by Joanne Fluke, Hannah still proves herself to Chad by finding Darcy's killer. Darcy was the perfect victim because she had several enemies. So the script did a stellar job of pulling you into the plot with an entertaining mystery, funny conversations, and a guest appearance from a Hallmark legend. This film establishes Chad and Hannah's budding romance, cements Lonnie and Melissa's relationship, and grows Delores's character. It's an easy enigma but a pleasurable watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Book Club Murders",
    "review": "Natalie walks around the bookstore with her daughter, Gwen. The owner, Wendy, gives Natalie a flyer for the book club. Natalie isn't sure, but Gwen encourages her mother to sign up. Natalie and Gwen can't help but notice the missing person's flyer on the wall. It's for Gwen's best friend, Lauren. It's been almost a year since Lauren disappeared.<br/><br/>Natalie cautiously walks into the book club, and Wendy greets her with open arms. Wendy quietly points out the club members, but Natalie knows some of them. Anita is the mother of Gwen's friend, Tori, and April is the guidance counselor at Tori and Gwen's high school. Sadie is the mother of Gwen's boyfriend, Tony, and newcomer Meridith, but Wendy calls her Margie. Natalie notices Anita holding a threatening note and a black envelope with Anita's name in calligraphy. Anita becomes defensive, snaps at Natalie, and leaves.<br/><br/>Days later, Tori texts Gwen with sad information. MIT revoked Tori's acceptance because Anita paid someone to take Tori's exam without Tori's knowledge. Gwen tells Natalie, and Natalie recalls the threatening note. Over time, everyone in the book club gets a black envelope except for Natalie. The book club implodes when Meredith barges into the club and slaps Wendy for having an affair with her husband. Then, the person with the poisoned pen kills April.<br/><br/>Sadie comes to Natalie's home under the guise of neighborly consoling and demands Natalie turn herself over to the police. Natalie kicks Sadie and Sadie's lasagna out. Later, Sadie goes to the mailbox and finds a black envelope addressed to Gwen. Natalie hides the threat from Gwen and runs to Wendy for assistance. But Natalie finds Wendy dead with a purple scarf tied around her neck. Natalie dashes away for help and runs into Meredith. The police hear about the slapping incident and arrest Meredith for murder. Natalie knows Meredith is innocent and vows to prove it before Gwen is the next victim. Can Natalie save her daughter?<br/><br/>This mystery starts slow because the first murder happens after 45 minutes. Then, the story goes into overdrive with innuendoes, threats, and shady people. While the adults bicker, Gwen navigates through the complicated world of teen gossip. Gwen hides this information from Natalie while she investigates the crimes with Tony. This plot is about Gwen and Natalie racing to the truth to save each other. The killer is compelling, and their motive is unhinged. The culprit's monologue pulls the film's insane plot together. This picture is the mystery LMN needed.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "There's a New Killer in Town",
    "review": "Alice greets her neighbors before going to work, and her student volunteer, Maddie, hands Alice the keys to the greenhouse. Alice notices a woman, Ronnie, taking photos of her and asks why. Ronnie explains she is an author, writing about small towns, and was taking pictures of the greenery. Ronnie allows Alice to look through the images, and Alice approves.<br/><br/>Alice goes to the Double R Diner to talk to her friend, waitress Holly. Holly spies Ronnie staring through the window at Alice after Alice leaves for the bathroom. When Alice comes back, Ronnie enters and sits next to Alice. Holly mentions Ronnie's creepy behavior, and Ronnie says she was looking at the menu to ensure it doesn't have seafood. Ronnie and Alice eat lunch and talk. Ronnie offers to pay for their meal but forgets her wallet in her hotel. Alice asks where Ronnie is staying, and Ronnie states all the hotels have zero openings. Holly questions Ronnie because Ronnie said she left her debit card in the hotel earlier. Alice dismisses Holly's question because Holly is overprotective. Alice invites Ronnie to stay with her for the evening.<br/><br/>Ronnie relaxes at Alice's home. Alice reveals she had an abusive ex-husband, Kevin. She escaped and settled in town. Holly moved soon after because her sister died. Alice's boyfriend, Officer Oscar, comes by for a late-night rendezvous, but Alice cancels plans with him for Ronnie.<br/><br/>Alice goes to the diner for breakfast but can't find her debit card or ID. Holly assumes Ronnie stole it but not Alice. Later that evening, the bank sends Alice a withdrawal notification for $250. Alice calls the bank to dispute the charges and finds her card and ID in her purse. Now, Alice questions her friendship with Ronnie. Alice thinks Ronnie wants more than friendship; she wants Alice's identity. How far will Ronnie go to get everything?<br/><br/>Lifetimers give this movie a chance. It starts slow and dimwitted, but everything comes full circle with a startling twist that fans want. Alice is a loving neighbor who opens her home to anyone. Holly is in Alice's corner. She refuses to lose another sister. The climax is so twisted you may have to watch it twice to catch all the clues you missed. This film feels like the typical new-person-is-evil plot but has so many layers. So, give this picture a chance for a rewarding ending.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Real West",
    "review": "Rebecca prepares breakfast for her sons, Ollie and Noah. Noah says he is applying to other colleges to be with his girlfriend, Jasmine. Rebecca assumed Noah would apply to Boulder because it's a good school, and she is up for tenure. She thinks Noah and Jasmine could use some distance. Noah admits he feels the same way but about her. It's been three years since their dad died, and he thinks Rebecca should have a life outside of home. Before Rebecca responds, she sees Jasmine and her mother, Sylvia, drive to the front door. Noah confesses that he invited Jasmine to their family vacation without telling Rebecca. Rebecca gives in.<br/><br/>Rebecca, Noah, Ollie, and Jasmine travel to the Mustang Point Ranch. Her sister, Cassidy, and mother, Maureen, greet them. The trip was Cassidy's idea to celebrate Rebecca's tenure, but Rebecca is still waiting for the call. However, Cassidy has an ulterior motive. She met a guy in New York and invited him to come. Rebecca stops in town to buy a hat and gets assistance from Jake. Jake circles Rebecca and picks up three hats that match her vibe. Rebecca realizes Jake doesn't work there and can't hide her embarrassment. She offers to buy him coffee as an apology.<br/><br/>Rebecca reveals her life story to Jake and gives Jake her number before he walks away. Rebecca gushes to her family about the new man she met. They want to hear more about the brooding rodeo man but stop her when Cassidy's boyfriend arrives. Cassidy introduces everyone to her new boyfriend, Jake. Rebecca chooses to stay away from Jake to calm her attraction. It will become increasingly difficult when Cassidy asks Rebecca to do recon for her by spending time alone with Jake. Can Rebecca keep her feelings at bay, or will she betray her sister?<br/><br/>This movie sets up for drama, but Hallmark wraps it in kindness and understanding. You know how it will end, but the writers ensure viewers don't see Rebecca and Jake as the antagonists. Everyone is pushing Rebecca to move on with her life after losing her husband three years ago. She's put her energy into raising her boys. In the conclusion, the audience will see that Rebecca hasn't let go of her pain. She does everything for everyone but leaves nothing for herself. That lesson is the takeaway from this film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
