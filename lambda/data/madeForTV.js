    "review":"Principal David Morales has a simple principle in his life: Take care of his daughter and if he has the time to take care of himself, he will.  His daughter, Noël, loves her wonderful father.  But she worries he works too much because they don't have enough money for her college education.  But David's sister, Marissa, knows that's not true. Marissa knows David works a second job, because he can't handle his sadness during the holiday since losing his wife.  Noël overhears them talking and decides to get David on a dating app. A few days later, David comes home to see Marissa and Noël jumping up and down.  He has a match for a lunch date. He meets his date for a not-lunch date and sees a familiar face, Sophie.  David has delivered and picked up several packages for her. They call their date practice dating, but David lets Sophie know they can practice anytime.  As David dates other matches, he can't keep his mind off Sophie.  He falls head over heels for her, but when he puts himself first, it could ruin Noël's Frosty Festival bell performance.  Can David learn to balance work and family while not neglecting his needs?<br/><br/>This movie peacefully blends cultures to celebrate them.  The food and dancing are strong standouts in this movie.  And the witty back and forth between David and Sophie will make you laugh out loud. While this movie isn't memorable, it's a decent watch for Lifetime or Christmas fans.  They both get their dream life.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Natalie is an event planner, custom wreath maker, calligrapher, dog walker, and has countless other jobs. During the holidays, she takes off and spends time with her cousin Olivia.  However, Olivia calls with a sad update.  A blizzard hit Rome, and she will have to cancel the opening of her new Italian restaurant in her hometown.  Since so many restaurants are closed on Christmas Eve, Olivia wanted to use that day to do a soft opening.  Now, Olivia will have to shut down the restaurant and open it on another day. When she hangs up the phone, Natalie gets a burst of inspiration, calls Olivia's friend, Savannah, and gets all the information about the restaurant.  Natalie walks into the restaurant and sees it needs a lot of work.  Then, she hears sounds in the back.  She finds a man cooking and tries to fight him off, but burns herself in the process. He is Stefano, and his uncle bought half of the restaurant but was too old to make the trip to the United States.  So, Stefano will stay and cook for the restaurant if she can get it open in time.  Natalie has a can-do attitude, but with busted pipes, no staff, and a culture-vulture food critic, Natalie will have her work cut out for her.<br/><br/>A Tastes of Christmas is a holiday movie that could have aired anytime of the year.  Not because it's intriguing, but because Christmas isn't the backbone of the film.  Just a deadline. You will focus on the romance between Tyler and BeeBee more than the main characters.  With so many movies out this year, you will lose this one in the holiday shuffle.  And that's just fine.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Dee's mother left her alone with an abusive father suffering from war-induced PTSD, and now she is trying to find a job but has little to no hope.  One day, the police come to her door and ask Dee about her brother's whereabouts. During the search, Dee inquires about becoming a police officer, and the officer tells her it's like applying for any other job. At the application, Dee meets a new friend, Gloria.  Gloria can't wait to become a cop and start shooting bad guys, but they have to take a psych evaluation first.  Days later, Dee writes a suicide note and looks at the numerous scars on her arms from self-harm.  She lied on her application and failed the psych evaluation, so they turned her down.  Before Dee commits suicide, Gloria knocks on her door and refuses to leave until Dee lets her inside. When Dee explains her situation, Gloria knows a workaround.  Her cousin failed his evaluation, but he faked a note from a therapist, and they cleared him.  So, Dee does the same thing.  In a few weeks, she graduates from the academy and gets awards and commendations.  With so few cops, Dee often rides alone.  One day, she suspects the group of guys of drug dealing and approaches them.  All, but one, runs away. He introduces himself as Trey and challenges her to chase him.  On a foot pursuit, she loses track of him.  But when she turns around, he kisses her on the lips.  Soon, the teen is riding in her car and at her home every day. On her side hustle, Dee acts as a security guard for a restaurant. As time goes on, the family that runs the restaurant hires someone else to be the security guard, and Dee is pissed.  Trey has an idea to get them back: Dee should rob them.  But she thinks the family is kind and they should not attack them.  So, Trey considers another angle, rob criminals instead.  Dee and Trey use her cop car to rob, and their robbing spree will lead to murder.<br/><br/>Based on the real-life story of Antoinette Frank, this movie doesn't put all the blame on Trey, who is portraying Rogers LaCraze.  The plot allows you to understand Dee had issues long before Trey came into her life.  With Trey, Dee had a kindred spirit for her darker exploits. This movie is a warning about unhealed emotional scars.  If you don't take care of them, they will fester and destroy you, and everyone around you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
