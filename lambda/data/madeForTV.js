    "review":"Kellie returns home after another unsuccessful date and finds her brother, Jack, standing in her kitchen. Later, Kellie meets with her co-worker to discuss selling her company. Kellie can't imagine running the business without her late husband, Tom. After building the company for 20 years, Kellie found a buyer in two months. After reviewing the final documents, Kellie meets her friend, Sasha, at a bereavement support group. They enjoy drinks at a bar, and Sasha urges Kellie to keep her toes in the dating pool. Sasha grabs Kellie's phone and likes Dan for Kellie. Dan matches with Kellie, and they make arrangements to go on a date.<br/><br/>Later, Dan comes to Kellie's home and cooks for her. He explains that he is between houses, but finding the best place is difficult. Jack raids Dan's car and finds a photo of Dan with another woman. He assumes Dan is married and keys Dan's car. Jack doesn't think anyone saw him, but someone is watching and taking photos from afar. Kellie goes to Jack for guidance, and Jack can't hide his concern. However, Sasha tells Kellie to hold on to a good man. Kellie sides with Sasha and pushes Jack away. Soon, Kellie falls ill, her cards decline, and someone attacks her. Can this widow pull her life together before everything falls apart?<br/><br/>While viewers will love to think no one is this naive, crime documentaries will have you believe otherwise. This movie has everyone making mistakes throughout the plot. The winning element in this film is the wood chipper. While it's not the classic Lifetime weapon, it's memorable in the best ways. And let's not forget the mastermind in this gaslighting chaos. The plot is predictable, but the craziness is watchable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Paging Mr. Darcy",
    "review":"Professor Dr. Eloise disembarks the plane and looks forward to the Jane Austen annual conference and ball. Eloise will be the keynote speaker but has another opportunity in mind. Professor Jennings, who sits on Princeton's Hiring Committee and is an Austen scholar, will attend. Eloise wants to get in her good graces and get the position as the foremost leading Austen scholar. Eloise stands dumbfounded when she sees a man dressed like Mr. Darcy holding a sign with her name. He is her guest of honor liaison and offers to drive her to the conference. While others cosplay at this conference, Eloise considers it ridiculous. Eloise waits outside, and Sam, a.k.a. Mr. Darcy, sits beside her. He apologizes for embarrassing her and drives to the remote location.<br/><br/>She locates Professor Jennings in the dining room and introduces herself but doesn't mention the job. Jennings laughs about the festivities and bucks at anyone who doesn't revel in the fun. Eloise nervously laughs, and Jennings waves over Sam. Eloise embarrassingly hides behind her hand, and Jennings introduces Sam as her nephew. Sam pretends that Eloise loves the dress-up, balls, and lawn games. However, he plays up the fa√ßade for a reason. An actor, Krispen, spends an excessive amount of time with Jennings. If Jennings hires him, she could become a laughingstock at Princeton. Sam wants Jennings to hire Eloise. So, he will ensure Eloise plays to Jennings's liking. Can Eloise and Sam stay in character and get the job before Jennings discovers the truth?<br/><br/>Inspired by Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Jane Austen fans can quickly infer which film characters derive from the novel. Eloise discovers having fun can help her connect to the books she loves and the author she admires. As Eloise lets her hair down, viewers will laugh and want to join the celebration. And if you listen carefully, you can hear Sam reveal his heartbreaking past. Also, Eloise's take-charge attitude comes from teasing and family duty. This film has a lot to unpack but captivates.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
