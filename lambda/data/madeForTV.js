    "review": "Joanna examines her husband's attire. Leo informs Joanna that he must meet a character witness, Piper, at Piper's studio and dress like a student. Joanna laughs and asks him to come home early for a surprise.<br/><br/>Joanna's mother doesn't hide her distrust for Leo while Joanna sings his praises. She knows Leo had issues six months ago, but now he's improving. Their marriage is on an upswing.<br/><br/>Leo meets with Piper after class. She gives his background information on his client's therapy sessions and offers Leo a discount on her services. Leo laughs. When Leo leaves, Piper looks him up online with a growing fascination. Leo arrives home, and Joanna has created a menu for their party. Leo agrees to the event and invites Piper.<br/><br/>When Piper arrives at the party, Leo admits to Piper that things have been difficult for their family. Joanna sees Piper and Leo quietly talking and worries they are too close. Days after the party, Joanna works to regain Leo's attention. However, he's going out to meet a client. To Joanna's surprise, it's Piper. Leo returns home to find Joanna sleeping, but she's faking. She knows Leo slept with Piper after dinner.<br/><br/>Joanna leaves to care for her mother after a bad fall. Leo arrives and asks to end their relationship. He is in love with Piper and wants to get married. Joanna follows Piper on a trail and hears a man, Brent, call her Pamela. Brent explains that he knew Piper as Pamela years ago. She stole Matthew from Ava and married Matthew within months. However, Matthew and his daughter, Mia, died in a sailing accident. The police never arrested Pamela. Joanna worries Piper will repeat her actions, and Leo and their children will die. She will stop at nothing to save her family and marriage.<br/><br/>Based on Wife Stalker by Liv Constantine, this movie deserves a part two. The beginning will give you three archetypes: the begging wife, the cold husband, and the scandalous mistress. As the plot digs into Piper's past, you will worry for the children. The climax has Piper staring down the barrel of a gun. However, the audience has no idea where the conclusion will lead. The viewers will fall in love with the acting on their 2nd watch. You will notice missed cues and varying chemistry. This movie is the film Lifetime fans deserve.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Husband's Baby",
    "review": "Reality show producer Aaron interviews Mecca about her upcoming cookbook and charity event. Mecca's husband, football coach Damien, interrupts the interview when Aaron relentlessly questions Mecca about her fertility status. Mecca pulls aside her manager, Trish, and demands to know why Aaron asks uncomfortable questions. Trish says Mecca doesn't have a storyline on the show Trophy Wives, and the fans grow bored with her. Aaron wants to create a buzz before the show considers dropping her.<br/><br/>Shocked, Mecca watches Trish stumble into her living room, feverishly typing on her phone. Trish tells Mecca to relax because she is on damage control. Before Mecca can question Trish, Damien rushes into the room and says it's all lies. Mecca insists on knowing the truth. A woman, Angela, is suing Damien for child support, but Damien swears he never slept with Angela.<br/><br/>Days later, the results reveal that Damien is the father of Angela's unborn child. Mecca tells Trish she wants a divorce. But Trish warns her to consider the repercussions. Mecca's brand hinges on her being in a happy and loving marriage. Damien meets with Mecca to explain. He got drunk at a party and passed out. Damien believes Angela took advantage of him. While Mecca is unsure of his excuse, she chooses to stay but won't connect with Angela or the child. But Angela has other plans. She wants Mecca's life and revenge. And she won't let anyone stop her.<br/><br/>This movie will make you scream 'the audacity' before each commercial break. Angela takes every chance to overstep Mecca's boundaries, and Damien lets her because she's pregnant. The plot does a spectacular job of blending this topic with today's reality television. While the plot slows, the conclusion brings the most jaw-dropping moment in the film. Angela's final monologue will shock you with one final twist. And the last 10 seconds leave the script open for part two. The ending saves this film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Foster mother Angie calls event planner Jenna to ask when Jenna will arrive for Sunday dinner. Jenna and her family meet every Sunday to reconnect. Jenna says soon but has an appointment to finish first. Jenna hangs up and bumps into consultant Andrew. They remember each other from high school. He broke Jenna's heart. They briefly catch up, but Jenna makes a hasty exit to contact her client, billionaire Tom. Jenna dials Tom's number but hears Andrew answer in the distance. Andrew is a consultant for Tom's company, and Tom instructed Andrew to work with Jenna on an event. Tom's company is launching its first non-profit and wants to throw a party to obtain benefactors.<br/><br/>Jenna joins her family for supper and her foster brother, Josh, reminds her that she has to do the dishes because she arrived last. Jenna's foster sisters, Shari and Kiki, join them at the table with Angie's newest ward, Rory. Then, Angie asks everyone to give a resolution. Rory doesn't have one, so he requests Angie to excuse him. Angie admits to her adult children that she worries Rory isn't connecting.

While Tom and Jenna spend time together, Andrew's jealousy grows. He must mend the past to rekindle his relationship with Jenna. But is Jenna ready?<br/><br/>This first installment focuses on Jenna and Andrew's romance. However, it's not their romance that captures our attention. It's the family dynamic. You will care more about Rory's mental state than the main couple's relationship. They encourage Rory to open his heart and communicate with the family. Their hearts are around the table and will captivate you. Viewers should watch this movie for the family bonding, not the relationship.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "New evidence frees Monica after six months in jail. However, Trevor's sister, Detective Ebony, believes Monica or Simone should be behind bars. After some time, Monica considers returning to Houston on her terms. She wants to start a podcast discussing the number of innocent people behind bars. Monica tells BeBe, who is ready to leave Seattle.<br/><br/>Joy calls her mother, Simone, from college. Joy's classes are going well, but she's struggling to make friends.

However, Sister Margaret warns Simone that her past awaits her there. Simone doesn't heed the warning and flies to Houston.<br/><br/>Ebony asks her boss for time off to mourn Trevor's passing, but that's a lie. She flies to Houston to keep an eye on Monica. Later, Sister Margaret travels to Houston. She visits Monica to warn her that Simone could be in town. These women's lives will collide when someone kills Sister Margaret. This spree killer won't stop until everyone pays. But who is the culprit?<br/><br/>This movie, unlike its predecessors, isn't a revenge story. It's a murder mystery. A person in everyone's life dies or becomes a potential victim. So viewers are unsure of who to blame. The plot will have you guessing until one dinner scene. You will spend the remaining time watching to prove you are right. This final installment wasn't the series' high note, but it's a fun movie that closes the book on every character. And their conclusions are acceptable and entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trapped In Her Dorm Room",
    "review": "Erin and Cade discuss their future scholastic plans. She wants to skip spring break and concentrate on finishing her project. Erin cuts Cade off to talk to her roommate, Kaley. Kaley warns Erin that Cade has a crush on her. Kaley then begs Erin to join her on spring break, but Erin says no. She and Cade will be some of the few students remaining on campus over the break.<br/><br/>Erin runs into Kaley in the hallway. After talking with her mom, Erin changed her mind about spring break. Kaley jumps for joy, but Cade isn't happy. He leaves, and Erin parties with Kaley in the dorm hallway. Later, Erin enters her room and finds Cade there. Cade hits Erin and knocks her out. Erin wakes up alone but can't open the door or window. Also, her phone is missing. Cade walks into the room and admits he has changed the locks. He won't let her leave until she realizes she loves him like he loves her. Can Erin escape?<br/><br/>This movie isn't the best entry for the 2025 Spring Breakdowns series. The start gives the audience some foreshadowing of Erin's eventual escape. However, Erin makes unforgivable errors. Also, Cade's dialog is a whiny regurgitation of the manosphere. The shining light in this film is Erin's RA, Anna. She listens to her instincts and sounds the alarm by contacting campus security, checking on Erin, and reaching Erin's emergency contacts. Viewers can skip this movie unless they need to scream at the TV.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
