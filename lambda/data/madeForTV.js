    "review":"Janie and Burt bring the family together to celebrate Grace's first month of sobriety. Grace talks to her co-worker, Red, about Grace's old friend, Richie. Grace is happy Richie is doing better and spending time with his son, Theo, but she wants to keep her distance from Richie and his drug use.<br/><br/>Red walks into work and hands Grace an envelope with money. Red says Theo hurt himself, and Richie doesn't have insurance. So Richie needs the cash to pay for Theo's medical care. Grace asks Janie to borrow Janie's car, and Janie hesitates. Grace begs Janie to trust her and promises to be back home by 3 pm. Grace meets Richie with her dog, Otis, and hands Richie the money. Richie hugs her, grabs her by the throat, chokes her, puts Grace in his car, and leaves Janie's car and Otis behind.<br/><br/>When animal control finds Otis, Janie knows something is wrong because Grace would never leave the dog behind. She will talk to Grace's friends, drug dealers, and a store full of people to find Grace. Janie doesn't know, but Grace is a victim of human trafficking, and Richie plans on selling Grace in 10 days. If Janie doesn't find Grace in time, Grace will be gone forever.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie covers the network and preconceived notions of human trafficking. Movies usually depict this 150 billion dollar a year industry as an immigrant problem. However, it's an issue that transcends race, nationality, or status. To survivors of assault, this movie should come with a trigger warning. It depicts some horrific brutality and forced drug use. This film is well-crafted but hard to watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Katie Moore is the number 2 interview influencer on Chit Chat and has gold medalist Jesse as her guest. Jesse's mother, Diane, hopes the interview will entice more people to follow Jesse because more followers mean more endorsement deals. However, Katie uses her platform to do a hit piece on Jesse. Jesse handled the interview like a pro, but it only heeded 25 new followers. Diane is furious and calls Jesse's manager, Cooper, to convince producers to ask Jesse back on the show.<br/><br/>Tom, Diane's boyfriend, prepares hot wings for the family. He offers Jesse some, but Diane won't let her eat because she has a meeting with sponsors in the morning. Jesse wakes up and hears her mother yelling at Cooper over the phone. Diane hangs up and tells Jessie her career is over, and she fired Cooper. Jesse runs away to Cooper's home for safety. Jesse drinks alcohol with anxiety pills and parties at a bar. She meets a bartender, Quinn, and they dance all night while a paparazzi take photos of the intoxicated gymnast.<br/><br/>After a wild night, Jesse accidentally returns to Diane's home to find the front door open. She walks inside and discovers Tom and Diane dead. Cooper offers to let Jesse stay in his home, so Jesse won't have to sleep at a crime scene. The photos of the club are viral, and Cooper is happy. The picture is her alibi for the murder, but Katie got a tip. They believe Jesse had someone kill Diane to be with Tom, and Jesse is their number one suspect. It will take a note, social media, and Katie to clear Jesse's name.<br/><br/>Be prepared for one of the scariest momagers on Lifetime. Diane stalks social media, threatens journalists, and scares Jesse to ensure Jesse brings in the money. While the script gets a bit wild with trafficking, money laundering, and obsession, the overall plot is something Lifetimers know well. You will be able to deduce the killer before the first hour.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
