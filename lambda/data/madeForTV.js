In the past, Lucy's ex-boyfriend, Ayden, invaded her privacy and stalked her. Lucy remembers from experience that without concrete evidence, the police can't help.<br/><br/>Lucy takes a break from work to clear her mind. She sits on a park bench and sees a man, Frank, with his dog. They politely converse until Frank talks about her being late for the lunch shift. Lucy never mentioned her job, so Frank's knowledge worries her. She believes Frank is her stalker. However, Frank has zero ties to Lucy. Megan worries that Lucy strings together coincidences and creates a fearful situation. Lucy focuses on work until she finds a mutilated mannequin with a scary note. Lucy sees this as a threat.

    "review":"Vivian and Ryan look at their prospective home with their realtor, Sandy, and fall in love with it. Sandy warns them the owner, Josh, is very particular about selecting the buyer. Josh demands Sandy accept Vivian and Ryan's proposal. Josh believes Vivian is the woman for him and Ryan is a formality. Josh knows the home needs repairs and offers to give Vivian a hand around the house to prove his worth. Vivian thinks he is being nice. However, Ryan sees through the act. They don't know Josh is deadly. Will they discover the truth before Vivian becomes Josh's prey?<br/><br/>This movie won't capture your attention. Vivian is naive, and Ryan spends more time puffing his chest than researching Josh.. The plot sets up a fantastic standoff that falls flat because the conclusion is a miraculous coincidence. The shining light in this film is Josh's Obsessive Love Disorder. It brings his character to a new level of crazy with a definitive reason. This movie is background noise because it doesn't require your full attention to keep up with the plot.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

He helps her make posts to lure Jason, but can he keep it up as he falls in love with her?<br/><br/>Madeline's tightly wound, but the script gives her a heartfelt reason to crave order.

His ex-girlfriend broke up with him, and he lost his passion for the business. They are dealing with broken hearts. This love story promotes positive influence in relationships and Niagara Falls.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
