    "review":"After living together for several months, Mel regrets the arrangement.  She is bored in her relationship with Ben and decides to end it. After he leaves, she calls to check on him.  She says he has landed on his feet and found a place that feels homey.  She is happy for him and continues with her life. As she and her co-worker Sam get closer, she is distracted by odd things happening in her home.  Items are being moved, a toilet set was left up, and she is hearing squirrels in her attic.  Mel doesn't know that Ben moved into her attic and he is doing everything he can to end her relationship with Sam and drive her into his arms.<br/><br/>While it's never explained why the passion between Ben and Mel died, it's understandable that it does.  Ben didn't do anything wrong, she just doesn't feel for him. To understand his reaction, you have to watch the first 20 minutes of the movie. With all the build-up, the ending just falls flat.  If you want a movie about an unbalanced stalker in your home, rent The Invisible Man.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
