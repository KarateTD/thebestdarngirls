    "mtitle":"Deadly Double Cross",
    "review":"Best friends since kindergarten, Kelly and Amber start their new school year with heightened anticipation.  They both have boyfriends, Kelly is dating Zander and Amber is dating Alex. After school, Amber meets up with Alex, and they go for a date in the park. They start to kiss, but he tries to go too far.  Amber stops him and tells him she wants to go home.  Alex calls her a prude and breaks up with her.  Seeing her daughter is sad about the breakup, Lisa tells Amber to go to a back to school party and have some fun with her friends.  Upon arrival, Amber sees Kelly, and they begin to chat.  Kelly offers to introduce Amber to Zander, and Amber his happy to meet him.  Until she sees his face.  It's Alex.  Amber tells Kelly immediately, and they both storm off. The next day, Kelly blows Amber off, and Amber is unsure why. At school, Amber grabs Kelly's phone and sees she is still texting Zander, and they fight in the school's courtyard.  Since this is the girls' first offense, the principal gives them a slap on the wrist.  But the law won't be so kind after someone finds Zander at the bottom of the stairs with a large gash in his head. After Zander dies and Amber ends up in jail, Lisa will fight to save her daughter, and Heather is by her side.<br/><br/>With a riveting premise, the movie never makes the watcher feel a sense of urgency or panic.  Also, the trailers ruined the twist ending, but the 'why' is a mystery.  While the actresses did great, the script was slow, and the victim was repugnant. This movie is background noise for your daily work.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Her Deadly Sugar Daddy",
    "review":"Bridget moved across the country with her best friend, Lindsey. Bridget's mother, Jolene, tells Bridget to get a job to pay the bills.  Bridget did apply to the Swerve blog, but the boss didn't believe she had enough life experience. At dinner with Lindsey and Jolene, Bridget catches the eye of Anthony.  But she believes he was looking at Jolene.  Without her permission, Lindsey puts Bridget on a dating app, and she has a match. While waiting on her date, Anthony sits down and introduces himself.  He tells Bridget she was the woman who caught his eye.  Then, Anthony gives Bridget his well-made business card and offers her a job as his assistant.  After waiting for hours, Bridget's date finally appears, and he is obnoxious.  Bridget leaves, but her date follows and harasses her.  Anthony stops the attack and offers her a ride home.  With her white knight's kind gesture, Bridget takes the job.  She stops in her tracks to learn the job pays $10,000 a month. At dinner with a client, the client starts to get handsy with Bridget.  She attests and tells Anthony to make the client stop.  Anthony says its part of the deal, and she doesn't have to do more than what she is willing to do. With a new sense of misplaced power, Bridget keeps the job and uses it to write her blog.  While Bridget thinks Anthony is a sugar daddy, she has no idea Anthony is a pimp, and he has killed before.<br/><br/>Bridget talking about feeling empowered by being pimped is the saddest moment in this movie. Her misguided empowerment parallels her misguided need for life experience for her blog.  Her saving grace is the strongest woman in this movie: Jolene.  Jolene doesn't fall for the nonsense Bridget spews about her new job.  Jolene quickly calls B.S. and tells her daughter to find a new line of work.  After that doesn't work, Jolene expresses her deep disappointment in a way only a mother can. If you plan on watching this movie, watch for Jolene.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
