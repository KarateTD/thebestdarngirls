    "review":"Amanda looks at the farm, sees zero flowers, and sighs. She has no idea how the farm will survive without a successful harvest. Amanda works in a coffee shop, and her mother, Grace, bakes to make side money. But it won't be enough.<br/><br/>Amanda prepares a coffee for Derrick, and he leaves a generous tip. Amanda's co-worker believes he was flirting. Derrick is the new pastor, but he hides himself from his parishioners. They don't know he loves extreme sports, and he worries they will judge him. Derrick prays for guidance, courage, and forgiveness. His mother, Lori, believes God will show Derrick the way.<br/><br/>Amanda goes home and prays over the harvest when she hears a crash. Amanda looks up and sees Lori stumbling out of her car. Lori identifies the flowers in Amanda's home and stuns Amanda. Lori admits she is a retired florist but never achieved her ultimate goal. Lori wanted 1st place at the annual Easter Flower Arranging Competition. Lori encourages Amanda to compete, but Amanda states she is a farmer, not a florist. However, the $20,000 prize changes Amanda's mind. Amanda enters the competition and sets herself on a path of love, friendship, and forgiveness.<br/><br/>This movie brings faith to the forefront and applies it to Amanda's harvest. While planting their crops, Amanda's parents strengthened and explained her faith and how to use prayer. These flashback scenes are great for younger viewers. However, the storyline stirs zero concern for the main characters. The film's shining light is Derrick's sermon. He says what all pastors should preach to their congregations, and the audience will welcome it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

For Jess, this show is about saving her family's heart, but she has to get past her stage fright.

This Shakespeare-like romantic comedy has enough spice to keep viewers watching and entertained with a Hallmark wholesome ending.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Allie visits her father, Giorgos, and grandmother, Yiayia, in Greece after Yiayia received a poor prognosis earlier. They stand at a street crossing, and an officer aggressively approaches and accosts Giorgos. Soon, Giorgos and the officer laugh. He is Giorgos long-time friend, Kostas.<br/><br/>Allie arrives in Yiayia's warm embrace and delights Yiayia by speaking Greek. Yiayia prepares dinner for Allie, Giorgos, and Kostas.

She believes someone killed her father and rendered her unconscious. She thinks Theo is the culprit, but Yiayia can't imagine Theo killing Giorgos. Can Allie prove someone murdered Giorgos and that someone was Theo?<br/><br/>This movie has several twists, allowing viewers to journey with Allie. The mystery will throw you for a loop, but the lead's stupidity will keep you grounded. She goes on an unknown boat alone, privately meets with a stranger, and turns off her phone's locator. The audience slowly loses sympathy for Allie. Viewers should watch this movie for the mystery and to yell at the screen.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
