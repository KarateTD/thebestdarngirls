    "review": "Mary walks to her son's memorial and smells his bloody shirt. Michael Jr. died in a car accident years ago, and Mary still mourns. She meets with her psychic, Anna, to discuss him and her daughter, Theresa. Mary remembers how her friends were jealous of Michael's intelligence. However, Theresa doesn't have a direction for her life and doesn't talk about having a family. Anna reads the cards for Theresa's future and sees a boy. Mary lights up.<br/><br/>Theresa applies bright red lipstick on the bleachers with her friends while watching boys play basketball. Jimmy pretends to trip and asks Theresa out for a movie date. She says yes and tells Mary. Mary wants to follow tradition and meet Jimmy before their date.<br/><br/>Jimmy makes a good impression on Mary but balks at his parent's divorce and religion. Theresa and Jimmy have a great first date, and Mary waits for Theresa. Theresa tells Mary the date went well but stays mum about the details before going to bed.<br/><br/>Later, Mary meets with her friends and tells them about Theresa's suitor. They gush over Theresa's outing with an intelligent young man with a good family and money. Mary revels in their admiration. She believes Jimmy is Theresa's future and becomes laser-focused on their relationship. She wants Theresa to do everything but sleep with him. Mary believes losing her virginity before marriage will ruin a girl and make her the talk of the town. Mary's concerns become obsessive when Jimmy breaks up with Theresa, and Theresa reveals they have been intimate. She believes if Jimmy dies, it will restore Theresa's virginity. However, she will give him a second chance to redeem himself or pay the ultimate cost.<br/><br/>This movie is frightening because it's a true story. This mom needed a life outside of her family. Mary uses stalking, cursing, and bribes to keep Jimmy in a relationship with Theresa. Mary cared too much about other's opinions, and she made Theresa desperate for love. Jimmy is a victim. He was acting like a dumb teenager and didn't deserve his fate. The actresses gave stellar performances. It makes you forget that the film feels slow. However, it allows the audience to view Mary's preoccupation with Theresa's life. This plot is dark, compelling, and shocking.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Goldy and Tom will have their first official date tonight. Tom was able to score tickets to Goldy's favorite band, The Faithfuls. The band stopped performing after their lead singer, Abby, died in a car crash. Goldy is elated to see the surviving members revitalize the band again. Goldy gets ready for the date when Nicola calls. Their caterer can't cook for the band tonight. Goldy accepts the job and updates Tom.<br/><br/>Goldy and Marla play around on the stage when the sound engineer, electrician Sam, demands they stop. Nicola apologizes for his poor attitude. Sam is stressed because the club's electrical system can't handle modern equipment.<br/><br/>Goldy paid attention to the band's rider. Selena has an allergy, Jax can't have dairy, and Derek is a recovering alcoholic. Goldy hands the group members their selected drinks, and they argue. During the argument, Jax mistakenly grabs Derek's drink, and they drink from the other's glass. Derek is furious because Jax's drink had vanilla extract. Nicola calls them down, pushes them towards the stage, and rubs ice on her neck.<br/><br/>Tom and Goldy wait for the band while Goldy sees her ex-husband, Richard, with Claire. Claire runs the band's fan club and hasn't missed a concert. The band walks through the crowd, jumps on stage, and argues. Jax leaves, and Selena exits after kissing Derek. Derek wrote new lyrics to the band's hit song and wants to perform the updated version tonight. He plays a few chords, touches the microphone, and dies by electrocution.<br/><br/>Tom secures the scene and calls Mason to help review it. They find smudges beside the amplifier, and Marla remembers seeing Nicola argue with an unknown man. As Tom and Mason collect information, Selena screams. They find Jax unconscious on the floor. He lives, but someone poisoned him. Later, the lab proved someone purposely rigged the amplifier. So, Tom declares Derek's death a murder. Can he discover who's after the surviving members of The Faithfuls before another bandmate dies?<br/><br/>The latest installment in the Curious Caterer series continues Goldy and Tom's love story and gives them an intriguing mystery. There are zero wasted clues and proper red herrings. Like all the installments, this film is busy for the first 20 minutes. So you can't miss a moment, or you will fall behind on clues. While this case could wear on Goldy and Tom's new relationship, it doesn't. It brings them together. Don't miss this perfect addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Eve bumps into Aiden while jogging and falls. Aiden wants to apologize by buying Eve dinner, so they exchange numbers. Aiden creates content while his roommate, Caleb, shoots it. Aiden builds up the courage and asks Eve to dinner. Caleb cheers until Aiden says Eve is coming to their home. Caleb thinks that's an ill-advised move because Eve could be a stalker. Aiden laughs off Caleb's concerns and plans a romantic dinner with Eve.<br/><br/>Eve and Aiden have a lovely night together. Eve returns home and scrolls through Aiden's videos. She sees him post with another woman, and her jealousy grows. Eve believes Aiden is her soulmate, and she will kill anyone who stands in her way. It's easy because she's done it before.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic Lifetime thriller, but the ending falls flat on your expectations. The audience knows Eve is a cunning killer, but we don't know her backstory. The plot slowly reveals her dark past throughout the movie. However, you will like Eve and laugh as she tricks Aiden into falling for her. This film will keep you locked in until the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Carrie runs to the hospital after her family calls her. Her sister, Riley, was in a car accident. The doctor informs the family that Riley succumbed to her injuries. Carrie sees her old friend, Detective Dylan, in the parking lot. She asks to see the toxicology and accident report.<br/><br/>Carrie visits Riley's widower, Adam, to see her nephew, Cody. Two things surprise Carrie when she knocks on Adam's door. Cody's nanny, Lana, answers. Second, Cody doesn't know his mother died. Adam doesn't think Cody is ready.<br/><br/>Carrie attends the funeral, and Riley's friend, Sarah, asks to speak to Carrie in private. Then, Carrie watches Adam chase a man out of the wake. Carrie returns to converse with Sarah, but Sarah's gone.<br/><br/>Later, Carrie meets with Sarah. Sarah spoke to Riley before Riley got in the car to meet her. Riley reported having dizzy spells before driving. Carrie thinks someone drugged Riley. Dylan confirms her suspicions when he shows her the lab results. Riley had cyanide in her system. Someone poisoned her, but can Carrie figure out who?<br/><br/>This movie tried to be a mystery but wasn't. To make the plot more compelling, you will wish for someone else to be the killer. However, it's who you expect and for the typical reason. This plot is unoriginal and drags with unnecessary characters and plot points. The audience should give this film a chance if they have no other options.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Parker rides in a limo with his girlfriend, Justina. The famous actors will walk the red carpet for the premiere of Parker's new movie. Unlike Justina, Parker hates the camera. He is infamous for dodging the paparazzi. Justina waves to the photographers, but Parker hides his face.<br/><br/>Adrian works for a tabloid magazine but hates her job. She desired to be a photojournalist. However, her boss, Sasha, cares about scandals. Sasha tells her team to get a photo of Parker by any means necessary. So, Adrian goes to Parker's red carpet event. Adrian knocks over her bag, and an apple spills out during the camera flashes. Parker slips on the apple and falls to the ground while Justina kneels beside him, posing for the pictures. Sasha prints a fake headline and reports that Parker is a drunk.<br/><br/>Parker and Justina meet with their manager, Marty. He says the photo makes them both look bad. Marty needs to do damage control before they lose work. Marty's first step is to sue the publication for printing lies. He tells Parker and Justina to take a sabbatical while he handles their mess. Parker finds a remote B and B and books a room for two.<br/><br/>Sasha learns Marty is suing the magazine, and her bosses are furious. She tells Adrian to take a break while she sorts out the issues. Adrian meets her aunt, Carrie, at the B and B.. Parker arrives without Justina because she has a movie shoot, but he doesn't recognize Adrian. Sasha discovers Adrian and Parker are at the B and B together. So she asks Adrian to get candid photos for the tabloid. Sasha will give Adrian a promotion with negotiable hours and legitimate work if Adrian does it. Adrian agrees, but is it worth her soul?<br/><br/>Any romance viewer can predict every moment in this plot. Marty and Sasha are the shining lights in the movie with their cunning. And Carrie offers kind words of encouragement. Otherwise, you can save this movie as background noise on a rainy day indoors.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
