"mtitle": "Dateless to Dangerous: My Son's Secret Life",
"review": "Noelle asks her son, Miles, to look out for his younger sister, Haley. Miles rolls his eyes and assures Noelle that Haley will be fine. Miles rock climbs with his best friend, Sam, and they discuss their college prospects. Then, they join Haley in the cafeteria, and Sam asks her to join the debate team with them. Next, they watch a homecoming proposal. Haley suggests Miles propose to his crush, Sophia, but he thinks Sophia is out of his league.<br/><br/>After some prodding from Haley, Miles gains the courage to propose to Sophia. Sophia tells him that she is going with friends. Students chuckle as they record the awkward interaction. Miles runs home and jumps online to play games and converse with internet friends. They tell him that he is a beta and an incel. Miles finds the darkest corner of the web to feed his insecurity and release his responsibility. Over time, he will turn on his family and friends and become violent. Can Noelle pull Miles out of the abyss before he becomes a danger to others and himself?<br/><br/>This film takes a bold leap into discussing radicalization. It warns that teens never have to leave their rooms to become indoctrinated into a subculture of hate. The audience's blood will boil as Miles's psyche snaps. Noelle writes it off as typical teenage rebellion and loneliness. She doesn't see the evil brewing inside of Miles. It's not until Miles's behavior turns vengeful that she takes action. The set designers made Miles's living quarters red, dark, and underground to mirror his feelings. This film isn't a debate but a warning to parents to watch out for the signs. Everyone should watch and pay attention.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Shattered Vows",
"review": "Newlyweds Sarah and Brendan share their first dance as a couple with their loved ones. Sarah's friend, Nicole, interrupts to ask Sarah a few questions. Brendan walks over to his sister, Rachel, dancing with his daughter, Kennedy, from a previous marriage. His ex-wife, Lindsey, stealthily slipped a threatening message before his wedding. Rachel warns Brendan to stay alert because his new marriage will make Lindsey spiral. The best man, Jason, shares marriage wisdom with Brendan before spending time with his pregnant wife, Nicole.<br/><br/>Sarah overlooks Brendan's work calls during their honeymoon. However, she can't shake the feeling that something's wrong during dinner. Sarah pleads with him to tell her the truth because she doesn't want to start their marriage with secrets. Brendan takes a deep breath and tells her about a case. Later, Sarah wakes up in bed and reaches out for Brendan, but he isn't there. She discovers Brendan's body at the bottom. Sarah is the grieving widow until Brendan's family and friends start to suspect her of killing Brendan. Then, Sarah becomes public enemy #1 on social media. Can Sarah prove her innocence before she loses her freedom and Kennedy?<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn with a strange jump cut because you never hear Brendan's secret. He tells Sarah he's withholding information, and next, she's in bed. It's an odd choice because it's a pivotal moment in the story. Sadly, the story has potential, but it picks the familiar Lifetime suspect and motive. Also, the lead is incredibly weak. Even if you set aside the poorly doctored images and misspellings, this film won't be a favorite of the 2025 Unhappily Ever After series.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "The Boy Who Vanished",
"review": "Tyler pleads to take the school bus, but his mother, Haley, says no. It's the only time Tyler's dad, Richard, can bond with him. Tyler doesn't know the truth. Twelve years ago, Richard and Haley's oldest son, Jack, disappeared. Haley stares at a picture of Jack and infant Tyler, she gets a phone call from the police. Jack's alive. He escaped his captors and called emergency services from a pay phone. Haley and Richard run to the police station and wait to see their son.<br/><br/>After interviewing Jack, the detective speaks to Richard and Haley. He wants to conduct a DNA test, but Haley screams, 'No.' She won't allow them to violate Jack's privacy after he survived untold acts. Richard and the detective accept her resistance. Jack leaves with them to start their new life together, but he's hiding a devious secret.<br/><br/>Lifetimers will scream when Haley refuses the blood test. However, Jack's lies aren't what you assume. The script's unsavory characters, Luna and Travis, are introduced to the story, but the audience is uncertain how they link to Richard and Haley, if at all. The conclusion will leave your jaw on the floor, and it saves this film. It's worth it if you can sit through the nearly 2-hour buildup.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Two Chefs and a Wedding Cake",
"review": "Chef Jamie goes over the specials with his team. During the meeting, the new owner, Braxton, interrupts to talk to Jamie now. Braxton wants to invite a food critic to the restaurant, and Jamie says no. Braxton fires Jamie.<br/><br/>Food critic Halle visits her sister's café. Halle's sister, Leah, directs Halle to the sample table. Halle and Jamie reach for a cake, and their hands touch. Leah watches her sister flirt with the handsome man. When Halle walks to Leah's side, Leah alerts Halle that Jamie is the notorious tabloid Chef Boy. Jamie joins his friend, Kylie, on the other side of the café. She informs him that Halle is a food critic.<br/><br/>Kylie calls Jamie because she broke her ankle and can't fulfill her catering job for a wedding. Jamie offered to complete it for her. Leah and Halle pull up in their father's driveway. Leah hands a 136-page binder with intricate details about the wedding. Also, She wants Halle to spend time with the best man, Peter. Halle darts away and walks to the kitchen. She tastes Jamie's bisque and adds more salt. Jamie returns and thinks his bisque is too salty. They spot each other in the kitchen and argue. Leah makes Jamie Halle's responsibility.<br/><br/>Jamie needs more spices, so Halle's father suggests she take him to the farmer's market. She can't handle Jamie's dismissive behavior and calls him rude. He thinks her job is disrespectful and destroys businesses. Halle considers a new angle for her work because the column is becoming stale. She wants to review chefs outside of their restaurants and chooses to start with Kylie's catering company. He cringes and allows Halle to profile him if he keeps Kylie's name out of it. She agrees and believes this article will help Jamie get a new job. Halle spends more time with Peter, nicknamed Mr. Perfect, and Jamie during this wedding. Which man will she choose?<br/><br/>The title is misleading. Rom-com fans will assume this movie is about two chefs in a wedding cake battle. However, the cake isn't a factor until the last 30 minutes. The title should have been Two Chefs and a Wedding. Leah's A-type personality makes her the comic relief. This film is great if you need a 2-hour distraction with a predictable ending. But you will wish Halle chose Peter.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "To Barcelona, Forever",
"review": "Nico assures Erica that she will get a book deal after Anna's publisher discovered that Erica rewrote Anna's book. Nico tells Erica to think positively. Erica breathes and repeats Nico's positive affirmations. Then, Erica's phone rings. She got the deal. Nico brings Erica to a special spot in Barcelona to make another dream come true. He gets down on one knee and proposes. She says yes. Nico asks a woman nearby to take a picture. It's Anna. Anna asks Erica how her latest book is developing. Erica reports that it's not.<br/><br/>Anna travels to an exclusive store that sells Estrella Saffron only once a year. After hearing the price, Anna scoffs and gives the saffron to the man behind her. The cashier informs Anna that the man is Javier Estrella. His family makes it in a reclusive town with closely guarded secrets. Anna wants to use his saffron farm for an article, but Javier refuses. Anna drives home to create a plan B, but her phone and electric car batteries die. She walks into a quaint town, and Javier spots her. He accuses her of following him. Javier is glad Anna is there, but tells her to leave in the morning.<br/><br/>Anna wakes up to several people in her room. They hug her and celebrate because they assume Javier's matchmaker found Javier a fiancée. After they leave, Javier explains that he's the rightful heir to the town and its saffron empire. However, he must be married to inherit it. Javier promised his family that he would get married by the next harvest. As Anna dodges Javier's family, she bumps into Erica. Javier panics, but Erica has a solution. Anna can write about the town and its saffron production if she keeps up the ruse for Javier's family. He agrees, but only if she lets him approve the final article. Anna and Javier speculate on when to be honest, but will their love become real?<br/><br/>This second part of the Barcelona series is the comedy Hallmarkies have been begging for. Javier and Anna say the wrong thing at the best moment. This movie focuses on Anna's love story, but it doesn't leave Erica behind. She and Nico discover communication flaws in their relationship. It's healthy to see everything after 'happily ever after.' Like the Wedding Veil series, the Barcelona story can grow and evolve. These actresses can pull it off and make these an instant Hallmark classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
