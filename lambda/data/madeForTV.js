    "review":"Nicole dates the hottest guy in school, Liam. But her friend, Angie, tells Nicole that their relationship won't last because they will graduate and go to different colleges. Their friend, Cassie, tells Nicole to trust Liam the way she does for her boyfriend, Isaac.  But when Liam keeps getting texts during their study session, curiosity gets the best of Nicole, and Nicole creates a fake profile on social media.  She names the profile Heather, grabs a random girl's picture, and messages Liam.<br/><br/>But he turns her down because he has a girlfriend.  Finally, Nicole feels comfortable in the strength of their relationship.  Nicole goes to school and tells Cassie and Angie what she did.  Cassie is disgusted, but Angie wants access to the account to test a guy she is dating.  Nicole gives Angie access.  The next day, Angie has proof her guy isn't cheating, but she tempted Isaac.  And Isaac failed.  Nicole and Angie tell Cassie and leave Cassie heartbroken, so Nicole deletes the profile. Two months later, Ms. Ramos introduces a new student to the journalism class.  It's Heather.  The same girl that Nicole used to create the fake profile. When Angie sees them together, the claws come out.  Angie knows Heather is up to something and vows to figure it out.  When Nicole questions Angie about the confrontation, Angie confesses a secret.  Before Nicole deleted the account, Angie changed the email address to hers. Since then, Angie has used it to help girls all over the county test their boyfriends.  They delete the account for good, but they have no idea what they have done to Heather.  Or at least the girl in the picture.<br/><br/>The dangerous world of Catfishing comes to life. With reverse image search, it's too easy to find the actual person in the image and take unforeseen revenge.  However, the catfisher never imagines they could cause someone harm.  While this movie could be a lesson to catfishers, it takes a Lifetime twist and puts the real victim in jail.  This film was a missed opportunity to teach.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Brandi Green finds it complicated to make friends in a new town and connects with an old friend, Jackie, for support.  Before Brandi and Jackie go out, a handsome man walks by Jackie's cubicle and introduces himself as Aaron. Brandi asks Jackie if she likes Aaron, but Jackie says no because Aaron is her brother-in-law.  Jackie tells Brandi to say yes to Aaron and see where it goes.  Brandi says yes to the date, and they spend every day together for two months.  Aaron invites Brandi to come on a trip to meet his parents. When they arrive, Aaron's parents' home stuns Brandi.  It is a summer mansion in the hills. Brandi meets Aaron's parents, and they welcome her with open arms.  But their head of security, Reid, gives Brandi an uneasy feeling.  At night, a noise wakes Brandi out of her sleep.  It's a woman crying for help, but Brandi tells herself it's all a dream. The next day, Brandi tells Aaron, and he makes pancakes to ease her fears.  When that doesn't work, he gets down on one knee and proposes marriage.<br/><br/>Elated, Brandi says yes. Brandi finds Jackie crying, but Jackie won't tell Brandi why.  Jackie brushes off Brandi's concerns and leaves.  This incident won't be the only weird thing Brandi experiences.  At the end of this trip, someone will threaten Brandi, will have Brandi at the business end of a gun, and will beg for Brandi's help.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing new, especially for the Stranger Danger series.  You get a mix of Traffik and Ready or Not with a splash of Crazy Rich Asians.  Once the couple has the quick engagement and Brandi starts to hear a voice, you can figure out what is going on and why.  It follows the formula of Lifetime to the letter.  Keep this one saved for background noise and nothing more.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The ladies of Beta Delta Chi get ready for a new crop of pledges.  Last year, Jana joined and her big, Arielle, helped Jana get acclimated.  Now, it's Jana's turn to usher in a new pledge.  After meeting with the hopefuls, one pledge resonates with Jana, a young woman named Bailee.  However, the house doesn't vote for Bailee.  Instead, they pick a legacy. The next day, Bailee sees Jana with her boyfriend, Kyle, and wants to know if she got picked.  With remorse, Jana tells Bailee no but tells her to rush again. Later that night, someone attacks the legacy student.  While the Beta Deltas rush to be by the legacy's side, they need to find a new girl for the house.  With Jana's encouragement, they pick Bailee.  This encouragement is a tremendous mistake. Bailee will hack, attack, and plant drugs on anyone who stands in the way of her and Jana.<br/><br/>This movie follows the typical Lifetime format. It's frustrating to see Jana believe a woman she has known a few days. As Jana keeps making bad decisions, you start to care less about her. And you want blood; this film isn't the movie for you.  The only kill is at the beginning.  Everything else is just jumpscares.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"On her way to work, Kate spills coffee on a man she just helped. During her morning meeting, Kate's boss, Patricia, goes over the assignments for the staff writers.  Then, he walks in.  He is Drew Hutton, and his family owns the paper. Patricia introduces Drew to the team, and Kate remembers spilling coffee on him earlier.  Patricia tells the staff about a story someone gave to her.  It's about a matchmaker in Sunflower Valley named Olivia. Since Kate gave this lead to Patricia, Kate believes she will be a shoo-in for the job.  But Patricia picks Drew.  Kate gathers her nerves and confronts Patricia about picking Drew. Kate pleads her case, and Patricia agrees to let her go.  But not as a writer, as Drew's assistant. Kate agrees and heads to Sunflower Valley with Drew.  Since Kate is from Sunflower Valley, she decides to stay with her parents.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, when her parents learn that Drew will be staying at the hotel, they allow him to stay in the guest house.  Kate creates a detailed itinerary of interviews, which Drew will never read.  As Kate and Drew work together, stories of love will inspire them to follow their passion and each other.<br/><br/>While the love stories will move you, the plot follows a simple format. Instead, you will experience spurts of interest with lulls in between.  The scenery is breathtaking, and the dialogue has moments of laughter, but the rest is lackluster. Save this one for a rainy day or when you need to hear a good love story.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"As Olivia and Nick write their vows for the upcoming nuptials, they have to prepare a wedding for Curt, a famous actor, and Autumn, a children's book author.  Curt promises Autumn to put Hollywood aside for a week; so they can enjoy their wedding in privacy. As they eat and finalize the plan, the best man, Dez, and his wife, Jess, arrive. As they all enjoy the merriment, Autumn can see a dark cloud looming forward.  It's Steve, Curt's publicist.<br/><br/>Steve tells Curt that the studio moved up the date of Curt's movie. Steve talked the studio into doing it at the wedding venue.  Disappointed, Autumn agrees to keep the peace and strengthen Curt's career. Olivia tells Autumn to be more understanding of Curt's demanding line of work.  But each time Autumn bends, Jess worries Autumn will break.  With everything going on with Curt and Autumn's wedding, Olivia and Nick get a monkey wrench in their wedding too.  Nick got an offer to be an opening act for a tour. Olivia knows this is a rare opportunity for Nick, so she comes up with a solution.  She will move up their wedding date. Now, Olivia has to plan a wedding while un-booking and rebooking hers. What can go wrong?<br/><br/>Fans of the series will miss regular cast members, but it doesn't take away from the overall story.  You have two couples with one partner in the spotlight while the other chooses to stay in the background.  Where they differ is their personality towards relationships. Olivia will learn to speak up, and Curt will learn to be considerate.  Seeing them grow under to tutelage of Olivia and Nick is astounding.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
