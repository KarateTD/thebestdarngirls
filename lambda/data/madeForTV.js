    "review":"Helen argues with her daughter, Kelly, and Kelly leaves in a rage. When Helen sees the police, she knows Kelly must have sent them.  But Helen is wrong.  Kelly and her unborn baby died in a car crash.  Distraught, Helen refuses to talk to the police and attacks an officer with a knife. A mental hospital labeled Helen with extreme codependency.  Helen spends nine months in a mental institution before her release.  It's been one month after Helen's release, and Grace, a social worker, comes over for a mandatory wellness check. It pleases Grace to see Helen taking responsibility, but Grace wants Helen to join a support group for women her age.  As Helen walks Grace out, she sees a new family moving into the home across the street and introduces herself.  The married couple is Sara and Kyle.  Three years into their marriage, they struggled with infertility, and Kyle cheated on Sarah with Angela. Sarah admits the whole sordid past to Helen while Kyle is on business.  Helen offers to be a shoulder for Sarah to lean on day or night, especially when Sarah finds out she is pregnant.  But this isn't an offer Sarah should take.  Kelly wasn't Helen's daughter.  Helen met Kelly once on the internet and fixated on Kelly and Kelly's unborn baby after Helen's real daughter, Layla, committed suicide.  Over the years, Helen has collected and killed several daughters.  And if Sarah isn't careful, she will be the next one on Helen's list.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie from Helen's point of view, it will entertain you with her trickery.  Whether she hires someone or gets her hands dirty, Helen will stop at nothing to get her daughter and grandchild by her side.  Blood or not. You have an idea of her capabilities, but not how deadly she can be to others.  This movie won't be a favorite.  But if you are rooting for the killer, you will keep watching.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tara's photography blog isn't launching as planned, and she waitresses on the side to make ends meet. She vents to her friend, Amy, and Amy suggests they go to her family's lakehouse before her parents sell it.  As Tara hears the word lake, she flashes back to 10 years ago.  Her brother, John, verbally abused her about becoming a photographer.  He pushed her, and her camera fell off a bridge.  Tara walked to the bottom of the bridge but couldn't find the camera.  After Tara walked to the top of the bridge, she found her camera there, but John's body in the water. Amy tells Tara to leave the past behind and have fun with her life.  After some browbeating, Tara decides to go. During a photoshoot, Tara and Amy run into Lucas - a man in need of a charger - and Amy invites him to the lakehouse.  Soon the women are at each other's throats and flirting with Lucas.  At the end of this ill-fated trip, someone will be dead.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of frenemies. As much as they apologize, they belittle each other.  It's all too easy for someone to come in and break them apart. As you watch Tara's current and past relationships, you will witness that she is an emotional punching bag for John, Derek, and Amy. After all of that, it's easy to understand who is stalking Tara, but it's why that will keep you watching.  And the 'why' is the creepiest reason in a Lifetime movie ever.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
