    "mtitle":"The Girl Locked Upstairs: The Tanya Kach Story",
    "review":"A student liaison walks a new student, 14-year-old Tanya Kach, around the school. The liaison tells Tanya to watch out for the mean girls and the strict, creepy security guard, 38-year-old Tom Hose. Tanya sits on the bleachers and smokes with another boy. Tom catches them and gives the boy detention but sits Tanya down to talk. Tanya doesn't want to go to her foster home because someone asked her to touch him. She reported it to the CPS worker, but no one believed her. She wants to move back with her mother, Christine but doesn't know how to get there.<br/><br/>Later, Tom finds Tanya at the bleachers and offers her money, directions, and instructions to Christine's home. The price for everything is a kiss. Tanya follows his instructions and walks to Christine's doorstep. She tells Tanya to leave and return to her foster parents. Feeling dejected and rejected, Tanya notices an address at the bottom of the instructions. She walks to it and discovers it's Tom's parents' home. He pulls her inside and drags her upstairs. He tells her to keep quiet because his parents will hear her.<br/><br/>Tanya wonders if Tom will let her attend school. However, he wants her to go to the home of his friend, Judy, and learn. Tom offers Tanya beer and assaults her. He walks to his parents' home and heads to his bedroom. Tom gives her the key and tells her to only open the door for him. He wants to keep her safe so Child Services won't return Tanya to her abusive foster parents. He promises it will be for a little while. That 'little while' will equate to a decade of abuse, sexual assault, manipulation, and control.<br/><br/>Based on Memoir of a Milk Carton Kid by Tanya Kach and Lawrence Fisher, this movie shows how grooming works. According to Tanya, Tom studied her student file before she started school. He knew she came from a turbulent home life and was desperate for love. She doesn't see the evil in Tom until she wants to leave several months later. It's easy to watch and scrutinize Tanya's actions, but she was a 14-year-old girl trying to survive a monster. Her story is a teachable moment for everyone to watch out for this behavior and have compassion for the survivors.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Tipline Mysteries: Dial 1 for Murder",
    "review":"Hotel concierge Maddie handles clients while listening to her police scanner app. She quietly cheers as her favorite cop, badge 219, takes down another suspect. And it's rumored that 219 will get a promotion to detective. After a full day of work, Maddie enters the Detroit Free Press and sits at the crime tip desk with her fellow tipster, Penny. Maddie calls Detective Grazier about a stolen cat ring, but he pretends to care.<br/><br/>Captain Nyland calls Officer Beeks into her office and takes his badge. She informs Beeks that he passed the detective's exam with the best score in the precinct. He will start his new job as Detective Beeks in a week and take over for Detective Grazier.<br/><br/>One week later, Maddie gets a tip: someone will rob a jewelry store tonight. Maddie calls Detective Grazier's number, but he doesn't pick up. She tells Beeks about the tip and asks him to put a patrol car outside every jewelry store. He tells her that's impossible and shoots down any other options.<br/><br/>Beeks gets a call in the morning. Someone shot Joseph Trimani in the neck with a dart gun before robbing his jewelry store. Sadly, Joseph died during the robbery. Maddie runs to Trimani's Jewelry after hearing it on her scanner app. Beeks interviews Joseph's estranged wife, Marcella. She gives Beeks information about the safe company, and when he arrives, Maddie is there talking to the owner, Luke.<br/><br/>Beeks gently nudges Maddie out of the store before questioning Luke. Luke's company supplied the safe, but he didn't install it. His former son-in-law, Nick, did the installation. Luke gives Beeks Nick's most recent address.<br/><br/>Beeks goes to Nick's address, but he isn't there. The home belongs to Amanda's grandmother, who is in assisted living. Amanda lives in the house with her boyfriend, Toby, and Nick sporadically sleeps there. Amanda permits Beeks to search the home, and Beeks finds Nick's old uniform. He notes it and leaves.<br/><br/>Maddie's assistant, Ethan, found other robberies with the same M.O. and uncovered the robber used an animal tranquilizer to knock out the owner. She runs to the police station with the new information. Beeks pacifies and shoos her away until Captain Nyland enters with the lab results. Maddie is right. Joseph's heart medication and the robber's tranquilizer created a deadly combination. Captain Nyland likes Maddie's skills and makes her a volunteer reserve officer. She wants Beeks and Maddie to solve their first homicide together. Can they trust each other and catch the culprit?<br/><br/>This movie has a solid foundation for a series. Unlike other stories, Beeks isn't a seasoned, hard-nosed cop. This crime is the first case of his detective career, and he has something to prove. Maddie is a true-crime lover. However, she was a crime victim who learned the purpose of tiplines. It will be great to see these characters grow together. The script gave the audience a glimpse into the Tipline Universe but has more to cover.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Michelle updates her husband, Will, on their nanny's prognosis. Someone attacked their caregiver, Charlotte, at the park. Now, Charlotte is in a coma, and the doctors aren't sure when she will wake up. Michelle puts away her work to attend her father-in-law's party. However, Will doesn't want to go because his father, Richard, passed him over for a promotion again. To prove himself, Will set a meeting with a client, Gabe, that he lost.<br/><br/>Will arrives at the bar to meet with Gabe, but Gabe can't make it because his daughter is ill. A beautiful woman, Melissa, sits next to and commiserates with him. Melissa meets Will in the alley, and they kiss. He walks away.<br/><br/>Michelle goes to the park with her daughter, Lucy. Lucy sees a woman reading a book from her favorite series and walks over to her. Michelle sparks a conversation about it, and the woman introduces herself as Melissa. Melissa is an out-of-work nanny. Later, Michelle hires Melissa.<br/><br/>After Will goes on his business trip, Michelle moves in to help Melissa. However, Michelle isn't the average crazy homewrecker. Will's brother, Carlton, sent her on a mission to destroy Will's life. He wants Will to lose his job, wife, and child. Melissa is his weapon of choice.<br/><br/>This movie has enough crazy to keep your eyes glued to the screen. The writers did everything they could to make the audience sympathize with Melissa. She wasn't a homewrecker by choice. Carlton forced her hand by threatening her mother, Madison. Carlton is a scheming but fun villain, and Michelle is the aloof wife who gains strength throughout the script. This film won't be a favorite, but it entertains from beginning to end.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Daniel watches his bride-to-be slip into competitive madness to prove she's right. Unlike Daniel, Nick knows what's going on. But he slowly falls in love with Tiffany. Both women learn a valuable lesson at the end. And why Amber takes the reservation will make you scream and tear up. This movie has funny and endearing moments but can frustrate you if you have a problem with immaturity.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
