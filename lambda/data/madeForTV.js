    "mtitle":"Hot Chocolate Holiday",
    "review":"Colette tolls night and day to recreate her grandmother's hot chocolate recipe into a powder mix.  Colette needs to get the recipe right and read the contract so grocery chains can sell her mix.  At the Christmas Kick-off, Colette meets Marcus.  He's renting the store next to hers and opening a bakery.<br/><br/>Colette orders a brownie with hot chocolate from Marcus's shop the next day.  She takes one sip and recognizes it as her recipe.  Colette thinks he stole it and wants to gather proof.  When her investigation doesn't get results, she tells him to stop selling it.  But he won't because it's his recipe.  Working on her grocery store deal, Frank heard about her competitor.  He gives her a warning.  If Marcus claims it's his recipe, it can kill her contract.  As she devises a plan, a fire destroys everything but the truth, the past, and their love.<br/><br/>While the plot follows the T.V. romance format, it solves the mystery of the recipe sooner than you would expect.  Instead of dragging it on for two hours, viewers learn the truth in the first hour.  Rebuilding their connection is the focus of the second half.  It gives the main characters more time to connect and heal.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
