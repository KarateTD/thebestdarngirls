    "review":"LJ's boss, Randy, drops a new account on her desk and expects her to work through the holidays. LJ reminds Randy that she put in PTO to attend Yuletide Springs. A town that celebrates Christmas every day with a wishing tree. LJ and her grandmother wanted to visit. However, her grandmother died. LJ leaves a Post-It with 'I Quit.' She exits with no plans to return. LJ convinces her friend, co-worker Tori, to come. Tori is too cautious to quit her job.<br/><br/>LJ hears strange noises from her car before it dies. They wait for help, and a tow driver, Carl, with antlers on his truck, pulls over to help. Carl and LJ instantly connect. He checks LJ's car and determines it needs a fan belt. He doesn't have the part and asks LJ and Tori to wait while he drives into town to get it. After 45 minutes of waiting, Tori's concern grows. Chris Kringle exits the truck and offers to fix their vehicle. He happens to have the part they need. Chris leaves as Carl returns. He feels poorly about not fixing LJ's car, so he invites her into his town to celebrate the holidays.<br/><br/>LJ, Carl, and Tori find Chris performing at the community center. Tori wants to know how his illusions work, but Chris won't disclose it. Later, Chris gives them gifts with zero explanation. He gives Tori a stamp and LJ a gift voucher. They take the confusing gifts with a smile and leave town. LJ and Tori believe this is the last time they will see Carl or Chris again, but this is only act one.<br/><br/>This movie focuses on holiday magic, but it isn't childish. The plot explains Chris's abilities in the conclusion. However, viewers will hope the magic is authentic. Each hint comes full circle and brings LJ closer to Yuletide Springs and love. She isn't using love to escape her humdrum life. LJ left everything behind in the first five minutes. She is a woman on a mission. This movie entertains, but it's easy to guess the conclusion.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Wren receives a distressing call from her sister, Kayla, and drives home to help. Kayla says their parents, Paul and Julie, constantly fight, and she can't take it. Wren advises Kayla to stay at a friend's home for the night. Wren hasn't been home since she left her ex-fianc√©, Oliver, standing at the altar.<br/><br/>Wren exits her vehicle, and her parent's neighbor, Mia, accosts her. Wren puts Mia in her place and enters the home to find Julie dead in the bathtub. The news leaves Paul and Wren's brother, Brody, distraught.<br/><br/>Wren picks up Kayla in the morning and gives Kayla the horrible news. Wren answers a knock and sees Oliver there for Kayla. Oliver works for Paul and remains close to the family. During their walk, Wren runs into an old friend, Gina. Gina works at Julie's flower shop and asks Wren to visit for information.<br/><br/>Wren goes to the shop but hides when she sees Paul leaving while arguing on the phone with someone. Gina tells Wren that Mia and Julie were business partners before Julie's death. However, Julie suspected Mia of wrongdoing and took the shop's key from Mia. Wren believes someone murdered Julie. Can she prove it after Paul got the body cremated?<br/><br/>This family's history will need your undivided concentration. The plot has adoption, blood relatives, affairs, and too many secrets. Wren isn't trying to play detective in the beginning. She stumbles across clues just like Julie's body. The plot moves slowly, but thankfully, a nosy neighbor spices things up. The motive is outlandish but provides the audience with an unassuming culprit.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
