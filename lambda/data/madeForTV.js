Now, it's the 50th anniversary of the ceremony and Sarah is headed home. She knows there will be a lot to do. However, she is not worried about Luke because he spends Christmas in Texas. Once in Louisiana, Sarah looks for her grandmother Doris. Instead. the first person she finds is Luke. Luke is in town to open his veterinary clinic. He promises to stay out of her way. But Doris has something else to say about that. She is determined to meddle until the two find love again.<br/><br/>While Luke and Sarah's relationship are the focal point of this story, it's the subplots that will melt your heart. Sarah's mother Charlotte and Mark, the photographer, will make you want to love. Doris and Timothy will make you want to keep it. While this movie does jump out the format a little, its too soon to declare it a favorite of the holiday.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Unlike all Christmas movies, this movie doesn't focus on a love story. If focuses on togetherness. It is a true standout this season. But DVR recorders be warned. The two-hour movie is broken into two parts. So if you set up your recording at 9 p.m. make sure you set it up for 10 p.m. too.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
