Monica broke up with Andre after receiving an anonymous D.M. of Andre cheating at a club.<br/><br/>Monica and her co-host, Elodie, learn that Clarke Montgomery is stepping down.  And Clarke's talk show is up for grabs.  While Monica was away grieving her father, her assistant left.  They replaced Monica's assistant with Simone, a new hire.  Monica can't believe they hired someone without her input but retreats to greet Simone in her office.<br/><br/>Simone is excited to work for Monica and knows everything about her. Later, Monica goes outside and sees Simone on her porch.  Simone explains that she moved in next door while Monica's neighbor, Ms. Fletcher, continues her vacation.  They discuss Andre, and Monica invites Simone into her home for drinks.  And when Monica wakes up, Simone is making her breakfast. While Monica thinks Simone is the perfect assistant, B.B. has reservations.  B.B. wants to do a background check on Simone, but B.B. has no idea the demons she will uncover.<br/><br/>A reboot of the 1992 cult classic, based on SWF Seeks Same by John Lutz, only copies the movie's creepy factor.

    "review":"As a little girl, Emma watched her favorite T.V. show, Plumshire Manor, and dreamed of being a butler.  With another year, she has another disappointment.
