    "mtitle":"Obsessed with the Babysitter",
    "review":"For years, Elaine babysat Adrian and Sylvia's two daughters, Lilly and Makenzie. Adrian continues his mother's work of studying people.  However, he doesn't focus on children like his mother, Sofia, instead Adrian's focus is women.  Elaine watches the children in the pool, but Sylvia covers her up.  Sylvia tells her not to wear a bikini around the house.  Elaine complies and apologizes.  Elaine doesn't know that Adrian was filming her, and Sylvia caught him. Elaine comes the next morning and can't find Sylvia anywhere.  She goes to the bedroom to find Sylvia dead.  Since there were no bruises or forced ingestion, police label it a suicide.  Now, Adrian needs Elaine more than ever to take care of his kids.  He will continue his case study by using her as a guinea pig.  Adrian watches her through hidden webcams in her house and records her at all times of the day.  If anyone comes in between them, he will gladly kill.  Adrian believes a true woman is subservient, interested in children, and fearful. Now, he has to possess her.<br/><br/>This movie has the creepy factor turned up to 10.  Between Adrian's home movies to his mother's, it's easy to see why he wants to control women.  With elements of Kept Woman, the twisted sense of masculinity oozes off the screen.  A great addition to The Babysitter movies but not a fan favorite.  Keep this one on the DVR for a rainy day or a creepy date night.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Wrong Finace",
    "review":"Richard showed up at Abby's job again, and her boss, Charlotte, warns him to stay away.  Richard is Abby's ex-fiancé.  After months of his possessive and domineering behavior, she broke off the engagement and their relationship.  Seeing the continuing harassment, Charlotte determines that sleeping on her couch isn't enough protection for Abby.  Charlotte got Abby a photography job for a rental property in Kingston Bluff.  Abby can work and get away from Richard. Abby takes the job and drives to Kingston Bluff.  She stops in town to snap some nature photos and spots a handsome man working on a fountain shirtless. Abby settles in, checks her voicemail, and has several threats from Richard.  To clear her mind, Abby takes a walk and more pictures.  She eyes the handsome man stretching shirtless again and takes more pictures of him.  She takes a moment to look at her photos, and the man is gone.  He sneaks up behind her and asks for a copy. They playfully argue back and forth until he introduces himself as Logan.  They have a good laugh, and Abby asks him for the local bar. She goes to the bar and gets a surprise when Logan sits down.  He owns the bar.  The two talk and have a good night, but Richard isn't far behind.  Richard is in two places at once and ready to kill.<br/><br/>This movie does take time to build, but once it gets going, it moves.  Now, you do get your Lifetime movie tropes with dumb cops and bad boyfriends.  However, you get women kicking butt along with a triple double-cross. Since there is no police history of abuse, the local cops don't believe Abby when she reports hearing someone in her rental property.  This movie isn't the best in The Wrong series, but it's watchable and gives the classic ending line.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Leah and Mark are three days away from walking down the aisle in front of their family and friends.  With no siblings and orphaned, Mark wants to start a new family with Leah.  Two days until the wedding, Leah travels to the bakery but doesn't see someone is following her.  While Leah is inside the bakery, the mystery person gets in the car, finds the registration, sees Leah walking towards the car, and hides in the back.  Leah drives away, not knowing the person is in her backseat.  When Leah grabs for her purse, she sees the person in her rearview mirror.  Leah pulls over, grabs the mace, and pulls the mystery person out of her car.  Leah can see it's a woman, but the woman is screaming incoherently.  The woman grabs her mace, sprays a good Samaritan, and runs away.  Leah describes the incident and woman to Mark, and he knows her all too well.  The woman is his ex-fiancé, Faith. He put Faith into a mental institution and broke off their engagement.  Mark warns Leah to stay away from Faith and contacts the police.  The day before the wedding, Mark puts up security cameras, just in case Faith comes back. On the day of the wedding, Leah takes a moment to meditate, but with her headphones on and her eyes closed, she doesn't see Faith entering the house.  Faith kidnaps Leah and tries to explain her side.  Faith tells Leah that Mark's real name is Brian, and he's the crazy one. Who can Leah trust? The man she loves or her kidnapper.<br/><br/>This movie is all about perspective. And with the title, you believe you know how the story will play out.  But with three fiancés, it's tough to understand which one is fatal. The most deadly and entertaining moment in the movie is Mark's California Mountain Snake moment.  See if you can spot it.  While this won't be a favorite, it's an entertaining two hours if you need to kill time.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"When Jennifer graduated top of her college class, her childhood best friend, Kevin, took a sabbatical from school.  She saved all her money during college to put a down payment on a house and allowed Kevin to move in so he could get back on his feet.  She believed that would take two weeks.  Seven years later, they still live together.  Kevin works as a caddy while designing a board game.  And Jennifer is a high-powered executive and dates Bryce. While Bryce does good work, his competition is a family man, and family men appear more stable to clients.  The boss knows he is dating Jennifer but has a girlfriend on the side.  The boss tells Bryce to clean up his act and marry Jennifer to cement his promotion.  The next night, Bryce takes Jennifer out and ends the night on one knee.  Jennifer accepts.  Jennifer comes home to Kevin and tells Kevin that they got engaged and he will have to move out so Bryce can move in. Kevin accepts it until he has dinner out and sees Bryce with his other girlfriend.  He runs and tells Jennifer, but she doesn't believe him. Kevin calls his brother, Jeremy, to explain the situation, and Jeremy makes a snide comment about Kevin and Jennifer being common-law married. Jeremy tells Kevin that he can declare himself married to Jennifer because they have been together for seven years. Sally gives Jennifer the sad reality that she and Kevin are common-law husband and wife. But Jennifer has legal recourse. Or Jennifer can have Kevin wave his common-law claim.  Jennifer chooses the latter and decides to make Kevin act like a husband to force him out. But both Kevin and Bryce will surprise her.<br/><br/>This nicer and less brutal War of the Roses takes a funny approach to divorcing.  It adds the little known common-law situation to pique your interest in the movie.  You will laugh as Jennifer pieces together that the little things they did to get by in the past qualify them as husband and wife. Jennifer tries to torture Kevin, but he takes it all in stride and learns about himself in the process.  By the end of the movie, they both become better people.  And you will enjoy watching their progress.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Savannah and Brad pack for their vacation with their young daughter Aria. Savannah won a week-long trip to the Koala Bay Nature Resort in Australia.  She vacationed there with her parents as a child, but Savannah hasn't been back for years.  Neither of them remembers entering the contest, but they are happy to take the trip.  When they arrive by boat, the captain tells them the ferry is the only way on or off the resort.  At check-in, they meet the concierge, Jane, who walks them around the hotel. If parents want to be alone for dinner, a movie, or any other activity, they can drop their children off at the kids club.  After the tour, Jane calls Pete to get their bags and show them to their cabin.  Later, Brad and Savannah meet their cabin neighbors, Gabby and Nick. The next day, Brad and Savannah want to go on a date, so Jane offers to take Aria to the Kids club.  Brad and Savannah have a great date, and Brad goes to the cabin while Savannah goes to get Aria.  Pete tells Savannah they have no record of Aria being there, and Savannah panics.  She has proof that Aria was there, but no one knows where Aria is now.  At first, they believe Aria is lost, but when someone sends pictures of the little girl, they know someone kidnapped Aria.  Savannah must look inside herself to find the culprit.<br/><br/>Congrats to Lifetime for providing a solid H.M.M. mystery.  There were plenty of suspects with unusual behavior from the employees, housekeeping, and the police.  At one point or another, you will lose and gain trust for every character in the movie.  By the end, you will feel justified and satisfied with the who and why. The actors gave solid performances all around.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
