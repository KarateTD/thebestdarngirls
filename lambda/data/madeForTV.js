    "mtitle":"A Model Murder",
    "review":"Kara finishes her photoshoot with photographer Dex, and they get a text from Kara's friend, Emily. Someone murdered their friend, Maxine. Kara and Emily meet at Kara's home and watch the news reports. They focus on Maxine's posts on Model Fans. Model Fans is a site for models to connect with their admirers for a price.

Kara believes this will boost her chances at her audition tomorrow.<br/><br/>Kara arrives at the audition, but the casting director wants to see her naked more than her talent. Kara checks her messages and gets another creepy comment from someone called Fireball. She blocks them and goes to the club with Emily.<br/><br/>Kara soaks her troubles away in the tub and takes photos for her subscribers. When Rocket sends more creepy messages, she blocks him.

She hopes Cody and Fortitech will put an end to her stalker. It is only the beginning.<br/><br/>This movie shows how internet stalking can become dangerous.

    "mtitle":"Secret Life of a Sorority Girl",
    "review":"Math teacher Cheryl declines a date with Principal Randall to spend the evening with her daughter, Ashley. Cheryl finds Ashley with her boyfriend, Beckett, but Ashley can't have dinner. Ashley flusters and says she will go to work at the library after changing clothes. Cheryl and Beckett stand in confusion.<br/><br/>Cheryl goes to work and sees her co-worker, Ben, recuperating from his bachelor party hangover. He apologizes and shows Cheryl an image of Ashley dancing on a pole. Cheryl immediately leaves work to confront Ashley at her sorority house. Cheryl demands an explanation. Ashley lost her scholarship after a poorly performing semester and needed money for school and sorority dues.<br/><br/>Ashley's sorority sister, Karla, runs to Cheryl's home for help. Both haven't seen or heard from Ashley for two days. So, Ashley decides to enter the belly of the beast as a rookie stripper to find Ashley. Can she do it without losing her life?<br/><br/>This film hints at issues strippers face, but it's not a call to action. It's a whodunit with pole dancing. The plot gives viewers several red herrings but nothing concrete. Cheryl challenges unruly customers, jealous dancers, and trashy boyfriends. One unforeseen alliance is the owner, Dolly. Dolly is tough but fair. She counts money first and your feelings second. The protagonist makes missteps, but mostly everyone gets a happy ending.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
