    "mtitle": "Unwrapping Christmas: Tina's Miracle",
    "review": "Tina prepares the store, All Wrapped Up, with her co-owners, Mia, Lily, and Olivia. They are excited that their store will sponsor the Annual Christmas Gala this year. But Tina worries. If it goes well, their business will thrive and expand. If they fail, it could ruin their business and the gala's legacy. Tina's friends assure her that the gala will go smoothly and they will win the wrapping competition again.<br/><br/>Tina eats lunch at her father's home. Her dad, Thomas, wants to have The Alford House declared a landmark. He is the caretaker and recalls meeting his late wife there. Later, Tina goes to the store to find a gift and sees a young woman, Haley, fumbling with a Polaroid camera. Tina offers to help. After fixing the camera, Haley explains that she's looking for the perfect gift for her dad. Tina helps Haley find a tie. Then, she hears a man's voice complimenting it. Tina stammers at the handsome man as Haley hugs him and calls him dad.<br/><br/>Tina visits The Alford House with Thomas and relishes in its history. Then, Rachel enters with frustrating news. The owners of The Alford House sold it. The new owners don't want any celebrations on their property. Tina panics because there aren't any open venues that can host all their guest this close to Christmas. Tina asks Rachel for the seller's name. To her surprise, it's Michael. His company is ruthless. She must convince Michael to change his mind or lose everything. Tina will need a Christmas Miracle.<br/><br/>This movie is the first of a four-part series. While it doesn't often incorporate the other characters, the plot introduces Tina and Michael with well-detailed backstories. They uncover their miracle in history and the beauty of a coincidence. The film has a subplot about Haley and Michael. Haley has dyslexia and can't find a proper school. Michael resigns to build one for her. That plot is beautiful. This movie is a decent kickoff to the series. Hopefully, the next three will be better.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Sister's Double Life",
    "review": "Chelsy walks to Tony's restaurant and sits in her sister's section. Her sister, Hayley, takes a break to talk to her. Chelsy hates that Hayley deals with Tony's sexual harassment and has to wear a demeaning uniform. Hayley needs the money to pay for her dental hygiene classes. Hayley can't get a job anywhere else due to her history of drug use and theft. Chelsy resigns to Hayley's decision and leaves for work. At home, Chelsy tries to convince Hayley again, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Chelsy opens Hayley's bedroom door, but Hayley isn't home. She goes to Hayley's job, but Miranda and the restaurant's handyman, Tim, haven't seen Hayley either. Chelsy calls Hayley's school and uncovers that Hayley never enrolled. Chelsy runs to the sheriff's office to report Hayley as a missing person. She will go to the darkest corners of the Earth to find Hayley, but will she like the double life she uncovers?<br/><br/>This film offers too many hints about the kidnapper's identity, but makes up for it by creating a compelling motive. Lifetimers will revolt at the sheer number of mistakes the protagonist makes. Also, Chelsy breaks the law multiple times. However, Hayley's double life keeps the audience glued to the screen because the plot doesn't reveal her secret until the end. While the kidnapper is standard, the execution is exceptional.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Technically Yours",
    "review": "Erin loses her coveted promotion to a newcomer, Jack. She covertly confronts Jack and discovers they had one class together before she graduated. Erin meets her sister, Sadie, and grandmother, Carolyn, at home. Sadie has terrific news. She and her boyfriend, Andy, got engaged. Carolyn worries that Erin will be alone and have no one to take care of her. Then, Erin screams that she has a pediatrician boyfriend named Brad. Sadie wants Brad to be Erin's plus-one for the wedding.<br/><br/>Jack discusses his investor meeting next month with his ex-step-sister, Taylor. He's creating a cancer screening prototype, but he knows he needs Erin's help with the datasets. Taylor sees the sparkle in Jack's eyes and discovers he has a crush on Erin. Jack doesn't want to pursue it because he saw an Instagram post of Erin with a man's arm around her. Taylor persuades Jack to call Erin to discuss working on the prototype.<br/><br/>Jack and Erin meet at a coffee shop to discuss the prototype. Before Erin can exit, she hears Sadie scream 'Brad.' Sadie walks to the counter for a coffee, and Erin quickly tells Jack the story of Brad. Jack offers to be Brad if Erin helps him with the prototype. They agree to a fake relationship for the wedding. Can Erin handle the ruse when her feelings become real?<br/><br/>This UP TV movie has the classic Hallmark plot. The difference is that Jack carries a torch for Erin and her coding prowess. The writers were careful not to demonize Erin's work. Erin lies because she doesn't want Carolyn to worry, and Jack goes along because he is in love with her. This film presents the classic meet-cute, misunderstanding, and ex-boyfriend's return. But it offers nothing else.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Machu Picchu Proposal",
    "review": "Katie's fraternal twin, Dan, begs her to go to Peru with him and his girlfriend, Luciana. He wants to get her out of the classroom before the new semester starts. She can find new ingredients and dishes to introduce to her students. Katie begrudgingly accepts his offer.<br/><br/>Katie, Dan, and Luciana arrive in Peru and meet Luciana's play brother, Chef Carlos. Carlos got a behind-the-scenes connection to visit Machu Picchu and bypass the government red tape. They arrive at Machu Picchu, and Katie can see the anticipation on Dan's face. He admits that he wanted to propose to Luciana there, but only after asking her father's permission. However, the early visit to the site ruined his moment. Katie tells him not to wait and propose now. Dan gives Katie his high-resolution drone to record the moment. Sadly, Katie fumbles with the camera setup, and another couple proposes. Katie and Dan return to Luciana's family home in defeat.<br/><br/>Dan blows several more proposal opportunities, and Katie blames Carlos. She thinks he is a liability and will reveal Dan's plan. She distracts Carlos, but Dan still can't find the perfect place to propose. So, Dan considers giving up. Katie softens and tells Carlos Dan's plan. He decides to help Katie find the ideal place for Dan's proposal, but will he and Katie uncover more?<br/><br/>This film is genuinely funny. Each proposal attempt exposes the audience to the astounding Peruvian culture while putting Dan and Katie in an uncomfortable situation. After watching this movie, you will never look at chocolate or alpacas the same way. The cast has a stellar connection that jumps off the screen. The writers respectfully introduce the audience to Peru's beauty. Viewers will pause their TV to marvel at the sights. This picture is a strong ending to 2025's Passport to Love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Pretty Hurts",
    "review": "Lauren works with her friend Rae when she gets a notification from her dream school. Lauren believes it's her acceptance letter, but the notification's link doesn't load. Lauren calls her mother, Julia, to check. So, Julia checks the mailbox and finds an acceptance letter. Lauren jumps for joy until she goes home. She overhears her parents arguing about the cost. Lauren's father doesn't want to saddle her with loans. So, they will encourage Lauren to apply for more grants and scholarships.<br/><br/>Lauren discusses her options with Rae when she remembers a customer, Helena, who had come into the caf√© the day before. Helena was in the pageant circuit with Julia. Julia used her winnings to pay for school. Lauren researches a local pageant and discovers that Miss Teen Starfire's registration will open soon. The grand prize is $50,000. Lauren thinks this is an easy win for her future. However, she will let her school, work, and friendship suffer. As Lauren faces harassment, corruption, and intimidation, Rae will fight for her life. Will they come out on top?<br/><br/>This movie starts with a devious pageant plot. However, viewers should remember that GSK sponsored this film. They can advertise their vaccine while entertaining. However, the advertisement takes too long and is too late. If you need a backstabbing pageant story, allow yourself two hours for this one. But only if you can look past the 15-minute ad.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
