    "mtitle":"Faith Heist 2: A Christmas Caper",
    "review":"Reverand Benjamin and his crew are working at the local mall to raise money for the Children's Hospital. Marge manages the mall and convinces Himmel's Jewelers to provide the tree topper. The Christmas Star is worth $1,000,000. While Benjamin plays Santa, Jack is his elf, who takes pictures of Santa with the kids. Gabs makes holiday treats that no one wants while Nas and Skipper set up the camera. Last year, this group pulled off a Faith Heist to save Benjamin's church after a con man investor stole their money. After they took down the investor, Dan lost his security job. Marge hired him because he wasn't a part of the lies. Dan won't allow another heist to happen on his watch, so he keeps an eye on Benjamin and the entire crew. Dan is correct to be worried because someone plans to steal The Christmas Star and lay the blame on Benjamin. Can the team take down the robber before Dan pins the crime on them?<br/><br/>This sequel allows the characters to grow while providing Home Alone antics. Since the movie focuses on the characters' hopes and dreams, they don't understand a heist is in the works. The story focuses on their interconnected relationships as the heist goes on in the background. Unlike the first movie, they create a plan on the fly in the last 30 minutes. This movie isn't a stand-out like the first, but it provides some laughs for the holidays.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

After her answer, he asks Kira out, but she says no because of his employment.<br/><br/>Aaliyah gets home and immediately posts for her Peaches to send recipes.

    "review":"Sloane leaves the recording studio after getting tragic news that her stepmother, Avery, died. Sloane returns to her family's estate for the funeral and the reading of the will. Then her stepsister, Lexi, gives Sloane a thinly veiled insult. Since her room is gone, the housekeeper, Wendy, helps Sloane to the attic. Sloane tries to run out of the attic. But someone locked her in, causing her to panic. Soon her stepbrother, Blake, opens the door with a devious grin. Sloane screams at Blake for being immature and runs to her brother, David, for comfort. Sloane is ready to leave and return to her boyfriend, Malik. However, David tells Sloane she must stay. Avery has a stipulation that they must all be present to read the will. Sloane promises to remain until the meeting, but that's a colossal mistake. Someone in this reunion wants to destroy the family, but will that person succeed before Sloane finds the truth?<br/><br/>This movie tries to add curveballs with suspicious actions, deplorable pasts, and an inheritance. However, experienced Lifetimers can easily pick the killer. It's the 'why' that keeps you watching the television. Just a warning, the 'why' is pretty pitiful.

  "review":"Montana breaks up with her boyfriend, Rio, because they 'aren't evenly yoked.' Rio points out that Montana was furloughed six months ago and had no income or place to live without him. She steps out on faith and walks out the door. She joins her church choir late, and the choir director mentions her for speaking during someone's prayer request. Montana stands up, testifies about her situation, and requests a prayer.<br/><br/>Montana leaves the church, and Sister Estelle invites Montana into her car. Estelle's son, Quentin, needs someone to care for his kids, Deirdre and Daniel. The job pays $75,000 a year with a room and meals. Montana received a teaching certification, and the job will be a perfect fit. Montana takes the job.<br/><br/>Quentin, Deirdre, and Daniel make sure Montana knows they don't want her there. Estelle assures Montana that the kids will warm up to her, so Montana takes a deep breath and settles in. Later, Montana meets Quentin's girlfriend, Chloe. Chloe makes passive-aggressive comments about Montana's clothes and demands to speak to Quentin in private. Chloe wants to live in Quentin's house, but he thinks it will be a bad example for the kids. This riff will cause tension between Chloe and Montana to grow. However, Montana focuses on the kids and her faith. She will use her love of the Lord to guide Deirdre and Daniel through their pain and into Quentin's arms.<br/><br/>Based on The Replacement Wife by Tiffany L Warren, this film reminds viewers of the true meaning of Christmas, and it feels genuine. The songs will bring tears to your eyes as they profess their unyielding faith. However, the script has plenty of drama for fans to keep watching and puts a spotlight on breast cancer. After watching this film, you will feel renewed and fulfilled. This film has lessons for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Can she persuade Ryan to accept the glasses to open his eyes to the world and Christmas?<br/><br/>While the sentiment of the movie is sweet, there are blaring issues in this story. First, Michelle would lose her license in reality because she filled out a patient's form without their consent. Second, Mark is a stalker.

Chef Grant bought it after years of hiding and leaving his successful job in the big city. Martha wants to know more about the man and the scandalous details of his life. Carly promises not to disappoint and have the segment complete by the 21st.<br/><br/>Carly meets with Grant and his restaurant manager, Beth. Carly gives Grant the release, but he won't sign it. Grant doesn't want to be in front of the camera. Grant left the city because the rumors about his private life overshadowed his food and harmed his daughter, Tess. He vowed not to let that happen again. Carly tells her camerawoman, Ramona, to keep filming. Carly hopes the documentary filming style will capture enough footage to appease Martha. As she introduces Grant to small-town life, he lets his guard down. But will that be a mistake?<br/><br/>Carly and Grant get along for the same reason they butt heads: they're perfectionists. Viewers get an understanding of Grant's disconnect from small-town life and the holiday as the story develops. This movie is an exemplary example of media spin. This film is for you if you need something calm to watch for the holidays.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
