    "mtitle": "Terri Blackstock's If I Run",
    "review": "Casey frantically cleans the blood off her hands and clothes before leaving Brent's home. She runs to Eddie's autobody shop and begs him to make her fake IDs. Eddie creates a new identity with the name Grace. Casey gathered some money. Now, she waits at a bus depot for a ride to Atlanta.<br/><br/>Dylan wants to join the police force but has trouble finding a spot with his PTSD. Brent's family wants to hire a private detective to locate Casey because they don't believe the police are moving fast enough. The captain suggested that the family hire Dylan. Later, Dylan sees pictures of Casey with Eddie. Dylan gains Eddie's trust, and Eddie admits to making IDs for her, only because he believes Casey is innocent. Dylan thinks she's innocent too. He follows clues to the bus depot and asks attendants about her. Then, he sees a lady running away.<br/><br/>Casey darts to the bus and hides. He spots her bus, but it's too late. Casey sits next to Lucy on their way to Atlanta. Lucy confides in Casey about her missing granddaughter, Laura. At the trip's end, Lucy offers Casey a place to stay if she needs it.<br/><br/>Casey sits in a park and calls her sister, Hannah. She will lie low and gather evidence about Brent's killer. When Casey was a child, she found her father's body after his suicide. However, she remembers seeing signs of a struggle. Casey told Brent she thought someone had killed her dad. Brent found evidence and called Casey to examine it. When Casey arrived, she found Brent's body. Casey recovered a flash drive from Brent's home, but it's encrypted. She won't return until she uncovers the truth. Can Casey outrun Dylan and clear her name?<br/><br/>Based on 'If I Run' by Terri Blackstock, this film contains a smaller plot within an overarching storyline. Casey unknowingly investigates Laurie's disappearance during her time on the run. While this seems a distraction, it helps Casey understand the corruption within and manipulation of a police department. The film displays two causes of PTSD. Casey struggled after finding her father's corpse. Dylan is a war veteran and the sole survivor of his regiment. The acting is on par with the network, but the plot exceeds it. This film is an entertaining and compelling start to the series. Sadly, Lifetime won't release the second film until 2026.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Killer in the Woods",
    "review": "Sarna and her daughter, Laurie, get into a screaming match about Sarna's ex-husband, John. Laurie believes Sarna is weak and gives in to the whims of men. And she says Sarna repeats those mistakes with her new boyfriend, Oscar. Laurie has no respect for her mother. Sarna commiserates with Oscar and yearns for a better relationship. He suggests they go camping. It will allow Laurie and Alice to bond with him.<br/><br/>They arrive at the campsite, and the park ranger warns them about bear sightings. They set up camp, and Oscar wins over Laurie by dinner. The girls sleep in one tent while Oscar and Sarna rest in another. Laurie and Alice hear a sound in the woods, but to Laurie's surprise, it's her boyfriend, Derek. Laurie leaves the tent to spend time with him.<br/><br/>Laurie returns to the tent but can't find Alice. She alerts Sarna, and Sarna panics. Oscar calmly demands that Sarna stay in their tent to gain her composure. Until then, he and Laura will look for Alice. During their search, they stumble across Derek's body. Oscar sees smoke in the distance. He hopes those campers can help them.<br/><br/>They arrive at the log cabin, and Alice is asleep inside. Then, Lynn Marie and Prophet Timothy enter. Lynn Marie jabs Laurie in the neck with a hypodermic needle. Hours later, Alice and Laurie wake up, but their shoes are gone. Oscar brought them to Prophet Timothy to help them start a new world order with a pure race. Can Sarna gather her strength and save her daughters from a narcissistic madman?<br/><br/>Laurie is a brat, but she is right. Sarna easily relents to the men in her life and insists on someone rescuing her. This plot point will irritate fans. As Sarna uses her wit to stand up for herself, you've lost interest in her character. Now, the cult members are well-written and based on the cult archetype. Prophet Timothy is the alpha and runs the cult to fit his needs. Lynn Marie is the beta. She devoutly follows Tim without question or hesitation. Oscar is the Omega. He is the weakest link of the group and the most expendable. The picture's build-up is annoying, but the conclusion is a satisfying gut punch. And, the last 5 minutes save this film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Unwrapping Christmas: Olivia's Reunion",
    "review": "Olivia grabs a truck full of gifts but almost forgets her dog, Ivy. She retrieves her precious pooch and drives to her store, All Wrapped Up, which she co-owns with her best friends, Tina, Mia, and Lily. Olivia must deliver the wrapped gifts today, but can't take Ivy. So, she asks her friends to watch the canine during her delivery. They happily agree. She believes the trip will take a few hours, but she plans to return today and help with the Gala.<br/><br/>Olivia approaches her destination and hears about an impending snowstorm on the radio. She knocks on the door, and her ex-boyfriend, Ben, answers. The conversation starts well, but changes when they discuss their breakup. Olivia hastily exits and drives down the road. However, the heavy snow closes the streets. She drives back to Ben's cabin to seek refuge. He allows her to stay.<br/><br/>Olivia settles in and calls her friends. She doesn't know when they will open the roads. She may miss the Gala and the competition. Olivia's friends believe it's kismet that she and Ben are stuck together. They ask her to make the most of this opportunity. However, Olivia only considers leaving. Does fate have something more in store for these exes?<br/><br/>The final installment of the Unwrapping Christmas franchise makes a dog famous. When the scene incorporates one of Olivia's friends, Ivy is a wild scamp in the background, causing lovable havoc. The storyline follows the plot points Hallmarkies know well. The plot feels boring until Ben's family arrives at the cabin. After their breakup, Ben badmouthed Olivia to his family. So, Ben's mother holds nothing back when they are face-to-face. That moment will grab your attention. Her return to the Gala isn't surprising because we saw it in the other three films. So viewers know this film's destination, but the journey is whimsical.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Before Your Father Finds Us",
    "review": "Mason sits in front of the parole board and pleads his case. He has been a model prisoner for 10 years and believes he deserves to re-enter the world and his family. The parole board says no because they can't trust his actions. Mason snaps, kills a guard, trades clothes, and escapes. When they discover the prison break, they call FBI Agent Farnsworth. Farnsworth informs his partner, Agent Samuels. Samuels wonders if they should call Mason's wife, Alex. Farnsworth's will, but he doesn't suspect Mason will find Alex because she and her daughter, Emily, are in the Witness Protection Program.<br/><br/>Sofia meets her friend, Amanda, at the church's bake sale. Their daughters will be spending the evening at Amanda's home so Sofia can spend time with her boyfriend, Steve. Sofia asks her daughter to take items in the car while she finishes her discussion with Amanda. Sofia doesn't see a man, Mason, quietly approach her daughter, Emily. Mason tells Emily that her mother lied. He is alive and wants them back. He pleads with Emily not to tell her mother he's in town. Emily agrees.<br/><br/>Steve and Sofia's date goes well until Steve gives her a key to his home. He's willing to wait for the woman he loves. Sofia gets a knock at the door and answers it. She's dumbstruck to see Mason on her doorstep. He can't believe his wife, Alex, is standing before him. He tells her he received parole and wants them to be a family. She says she has to tie up loose ends and will leave with him in the morning. He breathes a sigh of relief and exits. Alex locks the door, packs her bag, and grabs some cash. Before she leaves, Amanda calls.<br/><br/>While Emily is at Amanda's home, she sees a news report about Mason. Amanda knew about Alex's past and name change. She calls to warn Alex. After Alex hangs up, Agent Farnsworth calls. Alex angrily updates him that Mason is there. Now, they know someone is helping Mason. Army Veteran Alex must use her skills to save Emily and escape a killer. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This film is frustrating because Alex does everything correctly. It's simple mistakes that lead Mason to her. This film doesn't rely on unrealistic methods to locate people. With few characters, the audience will easily narrow down who Mason's accomplice is. However, the writer's passion for booby traps and guns shines through the script. While the plot twist is unsurprising, the film is an enjoyable rollercoaster.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
