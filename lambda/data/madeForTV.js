    "mtitle": "Monster in the Family: The Stacy Kananen Story",
    "review": "Stacey's nightmares about her father, Richard Sr., keep her up at night. Her wife, Susan, wishes Stacey would open up more, but Stacey locks those emotions deep inside. Stacey relaxes with her sister, Cheryl, and mother, Marilyn. Then, their brother, Rickie Jr., knocks on the door. They bond over their safety but shun their past. Richard Sr. was an abusive, alcoholic, sadistic psychopath. Fifteen years ago, Richard abandoned the family. They haven't looked back since.<br/><br/>Cheryl calls Stacey in a panic. Marilyn's boss hasn't heard from her in days. The siblings go to her home to find a mess and a stack of paperwork, but Marilyn isn't there. They decide to call the police.<br/><br/>As the police search for Marilyn, Rickie and Stacey build their relationship. He gets an idea to start a landscaping business while helping Stacey plant flowers. He puts $400 into the account and has Stacey sign paperwork.<br/><br/>The detectives ask Stacey to come to the precinct for some questions. Unfortunately, the interview paints Stacey in a negative light. They deduced that she killed Marilyn to hide business fraud. Rickie told them everything. Stacey vehemently denies the allegations. Without evidence, they let Stacey go. She gets in her car, cries, and jumps when Rickie enters. He tells her to go to Marilyn's home.<br/><br/>They drive to the location, and Rickie tells Stacey the truth. He and Marilyn killed Richard 15 years ago and buried him in Marilyn's garage. Then, he killed his mother and buried her in Stacey's backyard. However, he named Stacey as his accomplice. Instead of fearing their father, Rickie idolizes him. This monster has more pain to inflict on her life. He wants her to be on death row. Who will win: the abuser or the abused?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Fear of Our Father: The True Story of Abuse, Murder, and Family Ties by Lisa Bonnice and Stacey Kananen, this movie shows several results of long-term abuse. Stacey suffers from nightmares, while Cheryl has a selective memory about the past. Rickie fed off the abuse and became an abuser. Without knowledge of Stacey's story, viewers will assume that it focuses on Richard dominating his family. It examines how Rickie wormed his way into their lives and the steps he took to implicate Stacey. Once you witness his deception and sadistic nature, the storyline is unforgettable.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Paradise Murders",
    "review": "After arriving late for their anniversary dinner, Emma promises to make it up to her husband, Jake. Jake doesn't take long with his request. He books them a week-long vacation at the Cresendo Hotel and Spa. He picked a hotel that she had visited multiple times as a kid.<br/><br/>They arrive at the hotel and relax in the paradise setting. Emma walks onto the balcony, and her hotel neighbor, Isla, startles her. Isla is there with her husband, Jarrod, and loves making friends on vacation. Afterward, Jake and Emma go to the beach and meet Sarah and her husband, Tom. Two couples return to the hotel, planning to eat dinner later. They don't see Isla take pictures from above.<br/><br/>During dinner, Emma and Jake can see problems arising between Sarah and Tom. It grows as their waiter, Lee, reads the special. Tom leaves early, and Emma consoles Sarah. Emma and Jake return to their room.<br/><br/>Emma walks on the beach and finds Sarah writing in her diary.

Emma joins them and sees Sarah's dead body.<br/><br/>The police interview Emma and Jake because others saw them with the couple before. Emma answers the questions honestly but holds her tongue when Jake lies about his whereabouts. Emma confronts Jake about it when the police leave, but he brushes off her concerns and focuses on Tom. Later, housekeeper Vera pulls Emma aside. Sarah gave her a note for Emma because someone scared her. Emma believes someone killed Sarah, and that person could be Jake.<br/><br/>First, the movie lives up to its name. The plot offers several murders in a beautiful location. The storyline has extortion, stalkers, and con artists. This film will keep you guessing until the end. Then, the killer's monologue exposes the hints you missed. The killer and the motive are enough to surprise you, but they are a bit overdone. However, the script is interesting enough to keep your attention despite moments of lull.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Jane Mysteries: Too Much to Lose",
    "review": "Jane and her aunt Sadie practice their routine for the Children's Hospital Gala. A reporter, Margaret, wanted to write a piece about the Gala and requested that Jane take the questions. Jane agrees with a smile.<br/><br/>Margaret meets with Jane, but doesn't ask much about the Gala. She's worried about her missing friend, Irene. Irene was an investigative journalist who was researching a major scandal. Margaret knows Irene wouldn't disappear with a thought-provoking case. The police didn't examine it because there wasn't a sign of forced entry at her home. But Margaret remembers that Irene was on a game show. She won $100,000. Margaret believes Irene is a target. Jane consoles Margaret and takes the case.<br/><br/>Jane meets with Margaret at Irene's home because Margaret has a key to bird-sit. They find that someone ransacked the house. As they walk around, they see a man, Craig, lurking in the shadows. He's Irene's nephew, and he hasn't heard from her in days. Jane won't give up on Irene.<br/><br/>Later, Craig gets a text message from Irene, but she doesn't call him by his nickname. Also, Irene left her location onâ€”something she never does. Jane, Craig, and Margaret run to stake out the area. She sees the police at the rear and waits for more information with a reporter named Sophie. Sophie learned that they had found a woman's body in the dumpster. John identifies the woman as Irene. Instead of investigating a missing person, Jane is looking for a killer. Will she succeed when the killer puts Sadie and the Gala in their crosshairs?<br/><br/>Based on Electric City by K.K. Beck, this film builds on the two strongest relationships in Jane's life. The writers remind fans that Sadie chooses to find a healthy way to cope with her husband's passing and leans on Jane for support. Jane's romantic relationship with John slowly grows as he tries to protect her. The downside to this buildup is that the mystery takes a back seat and feels rushed. The murder board barely appears in this episode. While it's an interesting story, it's not the best of the series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Little Girl Who Lived",
    "review": "Author Alice sits with her loyal fans at a book signing. The host asks the crowd for questions, and an enthusiastic Claire has plenty. Claire gets Alice to unveil the focus of her next book. For years, Alice wrote about kidnappings and killers. However, she never wrote about her experience. When Alice was a child, a man, Strigoi, kidnapped her. She escaped, but the police never caught him.<br/><br/>Alice's sister, Officer Emma, picks up Alice from the bookstore. She thinks Alice should use her time at home to confront her past demons. Alice doesn't think anything is that simple, with the Strigoi still out there. Before she falls asleep, Alice checks on Emma. She finds a brick with a threatening note, and Emma is missing. Alice knows Strigoi took her sister. She will risk everything to get Emma back.<br/><br/>This film has the classic Lifetime architecture of useless cops labeling a victim as hysterical as her attacker roams free. This movie entertains with a delightful twist and a unique attack. The writers didn't bother hinting at a part two because everyone gets a perfect conclusion. However, this film doesn't offer much more to write about. This film is precisely what you expect and nothing more.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Heartstrings Attached",
    "review": "Chef Emma has her ideas rejected by her boss, Nathan, again. She dreams of opening a restaurant one day, but doesn't have the funds. Then, a man named Ned approaches the owner's mother, Rita, and asks for Emma. Emma recognizes him because he was her grandfather's lawyer. Ned sadly informs Emma that her grandfather has passed away. Ned wants Emma to come to his office to discuss her grandfather's will.<br/><br/>Emma arrives at the office but gets stuck in the elevator with Andrew. She panics, but Andrew helps ease her. They go their separate ways, and Emma meets with Ned. Emma's grandfather, Carl, left everything to Emma, but under one condition. He believed Emma gave up her violin career for cooking. He wants her to use her talents to inspire others. Carl requested that Emma mentor a young violinist, Ava, to prepare her for an audition for a prestigious music program. Emma deeply sighs and agrees. Emma doesn't know that Andrew is Ava's father, and Carl had a bigger dream for her life than teaching Ava how to play the violin. Will she fulfill it?<br/><br/>The premise is sweet depending on how the viewer sees it. They can see an elderly man trying to ensure his granddaughter's happiness. Or they can see an overbearing man attempt to impose his way of life on her. The unnecessary 'magical' chimes pushed this film into the Christmas genre. The editor attempted to hide the air violin playing. However, you can't ignore it. This film's saving grace is a fun, talented, and strong-willed young woman. She steals every scene.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
