    "mtitle":"Ladies of the '80s: A Divas Christmas",
    "review":"Producer Alex convinces a network to bring back a classic '80s drama for a live TV Christmas performance. He invited the five main characters, but only four signed on. Then, Alex persuaded the higher-ups to hire his friend, Nell, to direct. Actresses Dana, Lauren, Margaux, and Lily get comfortable in the house. But everything goes awry when Juliette appears. They choose to stay and pretend to be kind.<br/><br/>The women work through a table read and see Nell and Alex's interaction. They decipher the two have an attraction for each other. They pull Nell aside and request more information. They had one date and kissed. Alex dropped out of college the next day and never called her. They restarted their friendship but never spoke about the kiss. They will use their wisdom to pair Alex and Nell by giving Nell the DIVA make-over. Can the women right the ship when their changes spark another man's interest?<br/><br/>This movie is for fans of '80s dramas and films. It has the signature slap, crazy storylines, and big hair. As the women focus on Nell and Alex, they must mend their friendship and overcome personal turmoil. They redefine DIVA for the next generation and allow the audience to fall in love with them. This film won't be a favorite of the season, but it is entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jessica grades papers at a coffee shop while overhearing a woman breaking up with a man. The barista calls, 'Jessica Johnson.' Jessica, the man, and the woman all stand up. The woman grabs the drink, stops drinking in disgust, yells at the man for getting her drink wrong, and leaves. The man, Hernik, said he ordered the right drink, but the wrong Jessica Johnson grabbed it. She exits, but Henrik runs after her with a question. Before Henrik can ask, he bumps into Jessica and makes her spill her drink and drop her exams. She gathers everything and asks Henrik to maintain his distance.<br/><br/>Jessica enters her classroom and finishes grading papers when Henrik knocks on the door with an escaped exam. Then, Henrik asks her to take Jessica's non-refundable ticket to Norway. Jessica says no to the preposterous idea, but Henrik leaves his number on her desk and spots a troll wearing a bunad. The hand-carved troll is from Bergan, like Henrik. The troll belonged to Jessica's grandmother, who took care of Jessica after Jessica's mother died. Henrik considers it a sign, but Jessica thinks he's strange.<br/><br/>Jessica meets with her PhD advisor, Bill, for an extension. She is writing her dissertation on polar ice caps, and Bergan is the birthplace of modern meteorology. He will give her more time if she goes on the trip with Henrik. She packs her troll and a photo of her grandmother. Jessica plans to leave Henrik at the Norway airport but will become integral to Henrik's life forever.<br/><br/>This movie takes a while for the unbelievable story to start, but it's building to an unforgettable conclusion. Jessica has no family and plans to spend the holidays working on her dissertation in Norway. However, Henrik's loving and inviting family won't let that happen. They fall in love by building each other's confidence. While Jessica tells Henrik about her life, he keeps a wall up about his. He lets go, and she becomes his sounding board. This movie will have you in tears, happy and sad.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Time for Her to Come Home for Christmas",
    "review":"Carly sits on a bus headed to Waterford Creek. She diddles with her guitar pic while reading A Christmas to Remember. Pastor John and his wife, Susan, hired Carly to direct the choir before the Christmas service. Carly's mother, her only family, died recently. So, Carly is happy to get away from the memories.<br/><br/>Matthew sits on the bus after finishing his latest tour of duty. Matthew hopes to see his high school sweetheart again and pick up where they left off. He didn't think their relationship could handle the distance, so he broke up with her. Matthew sees a guitar pic on the bus floor as he disembarks. He picks it up and puts it in his bag.<br/><br/>John and Susan invite Carly to stay with them and attend Sunday service. Susan must contain her excitement about seeing Carly and wants to make the house more festive for her. So Susan asks her friend's son, Matthew, to get a tree. Carly goes to the tree shop and hears a man singing. It's Matthew. She asks him to join the choir because he has a beautiful tenor. Carly wears Matthew down, and he joins the choir. This moment is the first step to healing their past.<br/><br/>Inspired by Time for Me to Come Home for Christmas by Dorothy Shackleford and Travis Thrasher, this movie hints at a bigger plot for the audience but reveals it at the conclusion. The singers have great voices and fill out the storylines with heartwarming tales. However, the plot is slow and dull. Keep this movie on the back burner for a snow day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Newlywed Xander comes to his family's estate after his father, Lionel, requests everyone return for an announcement. The house manager, Ms. Harper, greets Xander with a hug while his stepmother, Marlena, meets him with disdain. Xander's half-sister, Nicole, runs to the door to welcome him. Xander lets his family know his bride, Audrey, will arrive shortly.<br/><br/>Soon, Lionel's lawyer, niece Teresa, and Teresa's husband, Warren, join them. Marlena leaves and goes into Sonny's room. Marlena enjoys having an affair with Sonny under Lionel's nose.<br/><br/>Lionel sits with Marlena, Nicole, Xander, Teresa, and Warren. He informs them that he is selling the company. Xander is furious because his deceased mother started that company. Lionel reminds Xander that he is a majority shareholder. Then, Lionel pulls Marlena into his office. He has evidence of her affair and threatens to tell her charity.<br/><br/>Audrey arrives at the home, and Ms. Harper greets her. Audrey runs to Xander and learns Lionel's plan. Then, everyone hears a loud crash. Lionel drunkenly fell down their stairs and died. Well, at least that's what the police say. There is something devious about Audrey's in-laws. Can she uncover it before becoming the next victim?<br/><br/>This family is a boiling pot of unlimited tea. There are countless affairs, multiple plans, double-crosses, and murders. Viewers need a pen and paper to keep it all straight. And most of the characters are underhanded. So, the audience will watch to see who comes out on top. This film is all about the drama, and it's captivating. Sit back and enjoy this before someone ruins the ending.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Aubri works as a ghostwriter and assistant to the comedic legend Bella Deldomino. She helps Bella on set and at Bella's comedy club. Aubri decorates the club for Christmas with a Frosty. As she stumbles with the large decor, a man directs her to the best position. She puts the Frosty down and sees the man is Mike. Mike started at the club but, like many others, left when he became famous. Aubri wants nothing to do with him because he left her for Hollywood.<br/><br/>Aubri watches Bella during an interview, and the report asks Bella about sponsoring the Christmas Fest at the comedy club. Aubri planned the sponsorship but never told Bella. Bella furiously returns to her dressing room and confronts Aubri. The Christmas show will have to sell out to break even, and people don't like to leave their houses on the holiday.<br/><br/>Bella decides to get payback by forcing Aubri to work with Mike. Aubri believes that naming Mike the headliner will help the show sell tickets. He agrees because he is falling in love with Aubri and standup comedy for the second time. Everything is going in the right direction until Michael's manager calls. Mike got the next blockbuster, but he has to leave for LA now to do press. Will Michael choose Hollywood again?<br/><br/>This movie is the standard Hallmark movie on Lifetime. The comedic sets are average, and the one-liners are dull. The only stand out is Bella. She is intelligent, a diva, and the show. She steals every scene she is in. Otherwise, this story is forgettable and shouldn't waste space on your DVR.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",
