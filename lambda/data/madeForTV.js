    "review":"Nina recalls the events that lead to her being accused of murdering Kelly, a straight A cheerleader with a bright future and hurtful words.  Before Kelly's murders, Nina changed her looks and threaten Kelly.  When the killer is brought to light, the small, upper-class, perfect town is rocked.  The remake of the 1994 classic, based on a true story, is told from a different perspective but with no real revelations.  Fans of the original won't get the ski trip or mayo scene.  However the crime is just as bloody and it will make you want to watch the original, now available for Amazon Prime members.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

She wants go get way from work and her personal life while spending quality time with her daughter before she goes to college.  After a string of bad decisions, Samantha and Ellie are victims of attempted murder, stranded at sea, and in a fight for their lives.  This Lifetime movie falls flat for the first hour but gets back on track for hour 2.  If you can hang in, give this one a chance.  There may be a part 2.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Professor Amy is a crime fiction professor for the English department with a nose for details.  So when 2 of her students go missing, she ask Travis and Claire to investigate.

As they help prepare for SnowComing, the spark between Jake and Samantha grow.  But can one nosey reporter bring it all down?
