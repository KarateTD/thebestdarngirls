    "review":"Heather calls Jess with a smile because she got the painting restoration job and $5,000.  Jess demands a celebration, and they go to a local bar.  They have a few drinks, and Heather walks up to the bartender, Marisol, for another round.  Heather never saw Tyler sitting at the bar, but Marisol thinks she remembers him from her past.<br/><br/>As Heather restores the painting, she sees her new neighbor, Tyler.  He comes over to ask for a glass of water because his system is not on.  Jess comes in and invites Tyler to brunch with them.  Things are going great until Marisol calls Tyler Robert. Marisol is an inconvenient hurdle in Tyler's plan to win Heather's affection.  Tyler will deal with Marisol or anyone else that gets in his way.<br/><br/>Tyler has some decent plans, but they are not well thought out.  This movie has cringe-worthy moments but in a good way.  You are supposed to cringe, cover your eyes, or gasp in horror.  And let's not forget Jess's funny one-liners.  By the way, you get a shovel.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Misha got a promotion and feels giddy.  Then, Misha's mother, Emma, calls with terrible news.  Misha's sister, Maya, is missing.  Misha doesn't believe it because Maya is an excellent swimmer.  Misha leaves for some fresh air, and Peyton, Maya's boyfriend, startles her.  Misha tells Detective Tom that Maya left a message last week, and Maya said she was in trouble and needed help.  After everyone leaves, Misha and Emma turn in for the night. Misha goes downstairs for water and sees someone in the house.  The masked figure runs out, and Misha calls Tom.  Tom blames it on a rash of break-ins and leaves.  Misha walks in to see Peyton's dad, Caleb, being extremely friendly with Emma.  They admit they have been dating for a year.<br/><br/>Later, Misha meets with Peyton, and he tells Misha that he thinks Maya had an affair with her boss, Mayor Peter.  Misha declares to find out what happened to Maya and why.  But Misha refuses to acknowledge that Maya drowned.  Misha will discover that everyone in town has a secret they will kill to keep.<br/><br/>Unraveling the secrets will shock you, but the perpetrator will not.  Two engaging twists happen within 5 minutes of each other.  And they save the film from being a typical Lifetime movie.  If you like to see juicy secrets exposed, get your tea ready.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Dylan gets in her mom's car and braces herself.  Her mother, Cindy, lost her job and boyfriend on the same day.  Cindy starts to doze off while driving, and they get in an accident.  Both are ok, but Cindy admits she has a problem with prescription medication.  While Cindy goes to rehab, Dylan's aunt and uncle, Shannon and Scott, will care for her.<br/><br/>Shannon and Scott get Dylan comfortable and tell her they will throw a Sweet 16.  At school, Julia approaches Dylan and shows Dylan around campus.  In chemistry class, Dylan answers a question right.  And it angers Tiffany.  Then, Tiffany's boyfriend, Jonah, asks Dylan to tryout for the track team.  To help put school issues behind her, Shannon takes Dylan and her old friend to see a local venue, Hartcourt Manor.  Dylan is in awe of the location, and Shannon makes the reservation for May 16th.<br/><br/>Tiffany's mother, Gloria, tells Tiffany that she couldn't book the Hartcourt.  Tiffany rages at Gloria and demands she fix it.  Gloria says she can't because a girl name Dylan got it.  This incident is Tiffany's last straw.  She vows to destroy Dylan's reputation, family, and education.<br/><br/>No one is murdered throughout this movie, so the title feels misleading.  Tiffany's entitled, disrespectful ways may have you reaching for the remote.  Also, the conclusion is anti-climatic.  With so much drama throughout the plot, you expect more from the ending: a fight, shoot-out, or standoff.  The resolution needed something more.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Then, Kayley sees the proctor talking to someone in a black SUV for a long time.  It seemed a bit suspicious, but Kayley forgets it.  Two weeks later, everyone gets their scores.  Kayley got 12 80, but Clea and her friends scored above 14 hundred.  Kayley and Monica attend Millie's celebration party, and Kayley sees Millie and Clea arguing.  Kayley walks over to comfort Clea, but Clea yells at Kayley.  Later, Kayley and Monica prepare to leave, but they can't find Clea.  They discover Clea dead below the balcony.  The police think Clea had a drunken fall, but Kayley tells them Clea had an alcohol allergy.  The police confirm Kayley's information and rule Clea's death a murder.<br/><br/>Kayley sees the list of students who scored over 14 hundred.
