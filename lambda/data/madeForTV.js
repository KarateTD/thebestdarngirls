Judy tells Abby not to get too attached to her high school sweetheart, Daniel.  Later, Judy goes out with her friend, Kendra, to celebrate joining the divorced wives club.  The next morning, Steven calls Judy.  Kendra was found dead in her home.  The autopsy lists the cause of death as heart failure.  Judy doesn’t believe it but Steven tells her to stay out of it.

When the toxicology report comes back positive for poison, Judy is relentless in her pursuit of Jason.  But does she have the right man?<br><br/>When this movie is done, be prepared to have no sympathy for any of the characters.  As they are picked off one by one, you see the reason for the killer’s revenge and rage.  Seeing the part all 4 played, you believe they deserve to be punished.  Experienced Lifetimers will see the killer coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Karen went to the drug store to pick up some last minutes items. Sophie, Karen’s sister-in-law, watches Karen’s son, Max, while she shops.  It was a mundane trip until a man comes in demanding fentanyl patches.  He points the gun at Jeremy and Karen jumps in front of him.  In seconds, the gun flashes, Karen and Jeremy drop to the ground, and police are apprehending the robber.  Karen gives her statement and heads home to Max.  Jeremy tries to talk to her but can’t.  And the police won’t tell him anything about her.  Out of nowhere, Jeremy approaches Karen on the sidewalk.  He thanks her for saving his life and offers to buy her dinner.  When she declines, he offers lunch instead.  She doesn’t know how ill he is and what he will do to repay the favor.   It will take a computer virus, sneakers, coffee, a box of extortion, and a freezer for Karen to see she is in trouble.<br/><br/>This movie is all about bullies, no matter if they are children or adults.  It’s unnerving to see Karen stand up to a man with a gun but not a tenant who won’t pay or rude co-worker.  Max and Jeremy have the same issue.  They are consistently bullied by the people around them.  When helping Karen doesn’t work, he decides to become a savior.  While the actors did an amazing job, the ending falls flat.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Tomboy",
    "review":"Tori is one of the best brand and marketing strategists at her firm.  As a girl, Tori played baseball and hung out with her best friend Adam.  Now, adult Tori and Adam are still friends and coach a baseball team with Adam’s niece, Rocky, as a player.  Tori  has never been a girly-girl.  She hates makeup, dresses, and heels.  One day, the firm is chosen to create a new campaign for Shelley Sweat cosmetics.  Tori’s boss, Randy, gives the campaign pitch to her because she is a woman.  Reluctantly, Tori takes the campaign.  During the research, she feels focus groups aren’t enough.  With the help of her friend and office manager, Krista, Tori gets a head to toe makeover.  The hot guy in the office and Tori’s crush, Brian takes notice.  As she keeps up the facade, Adam challenges her: Change back and see if Brian still likes you.  This tomboy turned girly-girl will get a response she never expected, leading her to find her true self and true love.<br/><br/>Don’t be mistaken, Tori isn’t the only one who changes in this movie.  Krista, a self-professed girly-girl, changes for a guy too.  Accept she pretends to like sports and sidewalk hotdogs.  Seeing who these women are, on the inside, will cause their men to have two different reactions.  One woman is accepted and the other is not.  The movie is funny and has merit, however, it’s a plot we know well.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lydia looks for a new apartment to leave her obsessive, alcoholic boyfriend Tim for good.  Before a potential landlord can sign the lease, Tim shows up and ruins the deal.  Lydia turns Tim down again and keeps looking for a new place.  She walks into a building and sees Drew fixing a light.  He offers an apartment with smart controls.  Drew leaves and Lydia gets settled in her new place.  Lydia juggles a job while going to school.  So when she gets a leak in her apartment, Drew is already there to fix it.  After fixing the leak, she offers him a drink. She has no idea how Drew could be so perfect for her.  But he has an ace up his sleeve.  He set up cameras in her apartment and watches her all the time.   As long as she is nice, he will be a dream.  But Lydia pumps the breaks when he goes too far, causing him to become a nightmare.<br/><br/>This movie does shine a light on Scotophobia and its causes but the plotline is a bit overdone.  Now, the best aspect of this film is that Lydia has an idea of what's wrong with Drew.  She can see he is coming unhinged and puts an end to the relationship.  She doesn't make excuses or blames herself, she tells him to leave and immediately puts up boundaries.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Blake is a smart girl whose intelligence is only appreciated by her boyfriend Mason.  Everyone else at school calls her a nerd.  She records herself singing and playing her guitar.  She sends the video to Mason.  As she sits with her mom, her phone's notifications come in quicker than a jackrabbit in heat.  She clicks on the link and sees the video of her singing.  And it has gone viral.  At school, she confronts Mason.  He admits to posting the video.  He wanted the school to see her talent.  Mason isn't the only person who takes notice.  Rachel, a talent agent, saw the video and wants to sign Blake. Blake begs Michelle to give her a chance and she agrees.  Blake starts going to parties, getting a fake ID, and meeting producers.  One, in particular, is D.C. Conway.  D.C. has written hit songs for several artists and thinks Blake will be the next big thing.  While she is recording, Blake starts to cut off her friends and family.  Next, D.C. asks her to get a passport. Before Michelle returns home, someone breaks into their home.  They don't notice Blake's passport was the only thing stolen.  D.C. convinces Blake to leave home and record a record in Mexico.  After she leaves, Michelle learns about the dark side of D.C. and his Mexican villa.  With a text message, a reporter, a kind stranger, and a near-death experience, Michelle will do anything to get her daughter back.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for the music.  Blake's singing and playing are not dubbed nor lip-synced.  The actress puts her heart and soul into each song. You will be dancing in your seat or feeling deep compassion for human trafficking victims.  While the plot feels like something from Surviving R. Kelly, it's the music that will stick with you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
