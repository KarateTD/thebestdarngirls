    "mtitle":"Amish Stud: The Eli Weaver Story",
    "review":"Detective Mike and Bruce walk to the home of Eli and Barbara Weaver, but Bruce makes Michael stop. Before approaching the crime scene, the Bishop tells them to keep their noses out of Amish business. Bruce and Michael find Barbara Weaver in bed with a gunshot wound in her chest and no signs of forced entry. Her children ran to a neighbor after discovering their mother, and the neighbor went to the community phone to call the police.<br/><br/>Barbara's sister, Abagail, frantically runs to the Weaver residence. The Bishop warns Abagail not to gossip. Abagail remains quiet and goes to her niece and nephew. The detectives leave the scene and run into Eli Weaver. Eli tells the detectives that he was fishing with his friend, Jerimiah, a Conservative Mennonite, during the murder. Eli believes it was an attempted robbery. Bruce and Michael leave with an eerie feeling about Eli. Eli never mentioned or expressed concern for his children during the interview. Their investigation will uncover affairs, sin, and abuse with the help of a prayer and journal.<br/><br/>Based on A Killing in Amish Country: Sex, Betrayal, and a Cold-blooded Murder by Gregg Olsen and Rebecca Morris, this film will break your heart. Eli only wanted to be Amish when it was convenient. Barbara does everything she can for Eli but refuses to perform oral sex because it is sinful in the Amish religion. She does what the church taught her and runs to the Bishop for help. He shames Barbara and lays Eli's poor behavior at her feet. Eli was a narcissistic psychopath with community support. The script ensures that technology isn't the enemy, only Eli. Thankfully, from the beginning, Abagail saw through Eli and refused to keep quiet. Be warned, Eli and Barb's sentences are a travesty.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Mystery Island",
    "review":"Jane calls her friend, Dr. Emilia, for help. Jane is on Mystery Island again and picks the incorrect killer. Ten times a year, guests come to the island to solve a crime, and each one is different. She tells Emilia to take a break from real killers and go on a vacation. Emelia consults with the police and analyzes murders. Usually, Emilia says no but is having second thoughts about her career path. So she says yes.<br/><br/>Jane and four others are island investors. The owner and main shareholder, John, started the getaway to keep his mother's literary legacy alive. John owns 80% of the island. Jane, along with three others, has a 5% share. The host, Fredrick, shows Emilia around the house and introduces her to the house manager, Lucia.<br/><br/>After the guests settle in, Fredrick invites them to the dining room for dinner. Fredrick plays a recording of John giving the guests their first clue. A worker burns the recording after it plays. Emilia and Jane figure out the first clue and find a secret passageway. They walk to a balcony and find two dead bodies. Jane recognizes Fredrick, but he's alive. The second person is the worker who burned the recording, but Emilia takes a closer look. She sees he is wearing a disguise and pulls it off. The dead worker is John with a dart in his neck. This death isn't a game, and John is dead. Fredrick calls the police.<br/><br/>Detective Jason and Chief Gloria investigate everyone on the island. The medical examiner determined the dart had poison on the tip. When guests want to leave, Jason counters by threatening to tell the public the mystery destination isn't safe. These amateur sleuthers must do the real thing if they want to go. Can they solve the crime before someone else dies?<br/><br/>Emilia tries to avoid the mystery but can't help herself. It doesn't take long for the guests to turn on each other. Viewers will use their H.M.M. expertise to pick apart the evidence and deduce hidden meanings, but this movie turns everything you know on its head. The compelling plot doesn't reveal a critical scene until the summation. And the culprit will have you rethinking everything you saw and heard.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Murder at the Country Club",
    "review":"It's Cassie's first day at Pinecrest Country Club as assistant manager. Her boss, Ava, welcomes Cassie and shows her around the property. It's Cassie's job to handle events and keep the members happy. Also, the club is hosting a golf tournament for their scholarship fund. Cassie inquires about her predecessor, Lisa. Ava says Lisa left without notice, closed her social media accounts, and left town. Cassie starts analyzing the books to prepare for the tournament, but it has a zero balance. Later, Ava decides to cut the worker's pay to cover the cost of the competition.<br/><br/>On Cassie's second day, she hears the club president, Frank, and Ava having sex in her office. She pretends to work when Frank comes out of Ava's office and says hello. Cassie's father, Brad, recommended Cassie for the job, but Frank had to convince the board to hire her. Cassie doesn't want to upset Ava but can't overlook Lisa's disappearance and the misappropriated funds. Something isn't right about this club, and Cassie will find the truth.<br/><br/>This movie takes a long time to get to the point, and sometimes the sound editing is awful. The killer is a busy bee who orchestrates a hit and run, a car accident, and a murder. The money laundering is blatantly apparent with open-door conversations, big-mouth caddies, and dumb criminals. The plot is slow, but the culprit is entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rachel and Abby drive to Azuridge Wellness Retreat to help Rachel get over her ex-boyfriend. Rachel looks forward to relaxing and countless activities, but Abby sees it as adult summer camp. Rachel bribes Abby with candy to have a positive attitude.<br/><br/>Abby and Rachel go to orientation and learn about the numerous events. Then, Abby sees a ghost from her past. Her ex-best friend, Sean, and he notices her too. They were best friends until high school and had planned an ultimate graduation trip since they were 11. Abby waited at the bus stop for Sean on the first day of their vacation, but he never showed up or called. Abby leaves without signing up for an activity. So Rachel sees Sean's choices and adds their names. Rachel wants Abby to be open and honest about her feelings for the first time, but it will take a long trek in the woods for that to happen.<br/><br/>Abby describes herself as a realist, but the script presents her as aÂ Debbie Downer. The audience doesn't understand why until an hour into the film. This late revelation gave the audience too much time to dislike Abby's attitude toward someone trying to be nice to her. However, don't give up on Abby. She makes a change. Viewers will get a well-deserved reform if they look beyond Abby's pessimistic comments.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
