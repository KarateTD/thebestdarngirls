    "mtitle":"The Beach House Murders",
    "review":"The police officer enters a home to find a bloody and beaten Sarah unconscious on the floor. Then, the officer sees Sarah's husband, Miles, in the bathroom with bloody hands, speaking jibberish while a tape documenting their marriage plays in the background. A year later, Alice calls to check on Sarah's progress. Sarah is a novelist but can't get past her writer's block because Miles recently got parole for attacking her. Alice, a great agent and friend, tells Sarah to stay at her beach house.<br/><br/>Sarah settles into the home and takes a walk on the beach. A fan approaches Sarah for the picture. Before she can reject his request, the fan snaps the photo. Sarah goes to dinner, and Tony approaches. Tony asks her to have dinner with him instead of getting takeout. Sarah says yes. She returns home and writes before going to bed.<br/><br/>Sarah wakes up to find her fan in the bed, wearing only a speedo. She runs and calls the police. Alice hurries to the home to help Sarah after the police offer little assistance. But Sarah refuses to leave.<br/><br/>Sarah stops at a coffee house. She bumps into a customer when she sees Miles standing behind her. She screams at him to leave as he stammers an apology. Miles swears he got help for his jealous behavior but didn't attack her a year ago. Sarah returns to the beach house with a heightened determination. She will finish her book through the distractions, but someone is watching. The culprit will blackmail, drug, and kill to teach Sarah a lesson.<br/><br/>The title feels misleading because it takes a while for the murders to happen. Like a novel, this movie has a lengthy setup before the body count grows. It allows viewers to look at everyone with a suspicious eye. Don't be surprised if you question Sarah's sanity during the film. However, everything, including the long setup, comes full circle at the wild end. And that ending saves this movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"She's Obsessed with My Husband",
    "review":"Garrett takes his morning jog when an old classmate, Violet, catches his eye. Violet and Garrett dated for a week in high school, but he dumped her before prom. Violet recently got divorced from Mason and moved next door to Garrett. They catch up as Garrett's wife, Daisy, pulls into the driveway. She went to high school with them too. Daisy and Garrett have been happily married for 18 years and share a daughter, Allison. Daisy wants to catch up, so she invites Violet to dinner, and Violet obliges. They take a picture together and part ways. Violet enters her home and prints the photo. She cuts Daisy out of the image and places the edited picture on her vision board. Violet has been obsessing over Garrett since high school. She plans to make Garrett her husband and be the best stepmother to Allison. But, she has to get Daisy out of the way first.<br/><br/>This movie is for old-school Lifetime fans. Violet is beyond crazy and uses con-artist, poison, and low-tech hacking to ruin Daisy's life. It's easy for Violet to wedge herself into Garrett's marriage because they are having financial issues. And who knew you could use a vision board for evil? While you watch Daisy's life unravel, the film's detective will surprise you. This movie pulls together what Lifetimers love: crazy villains, backstabbers, fights, and a shovel. Get your popcorn ready.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love by Design",
    "review":"Fifteen years ago, Brooke followed the teachings of Oprah and created a vision board. She wanted to start a design business called BY Designs, get married in a gazebo, lose 5 pounds, get a dog, own a beautiful home, and find her soul mate.<br/><br/>Today, Brooke works for her boyfriend, Brent, and put her interior design dreams on hold to help build his business. Brent asks for Brooke for an item, and she looks through his office desk. Inside a drawer, Brooke finds an engagement ring. She bounces with excitement while he dumps her. Brooke inquires about the ring, and Brent admits it's for another woman.<br/><br/>Brooke moves out of Brent's home and into her mom's. She crawls into her old bed, eats chocolate chip cookies, and cries. Brooke's mom, Diane, allows Brooke to cry but brings her downstairs to celebrate her 30th birthday. Diane runs and grabs Brooke's vision board. She wants Brooke to wish for everything on it. Brooke closes her eyes, wishes, and the lights flicker.<br/><br/>Diane finds a job for Brooke, so Brooke gets ready. Diane convinces Brooke to weigh herself. To Brooke's surprise, she lost 5 pounds. She goes to work, and a man, Josh, enters to sell his handcrafted furniture. Later, Brooke finds a dog, Mr. Noodles, outside her home. And it's the same one from her vision board.<br/><br/>Brooke goes to work, and Josh returns. Her boss, Trevor, didn't like his work. Then, Diane brings Mr. Noodles to Brooke's workplace because Diane has other commitments and can't watch him. Brooke leaves with the dog and bumps into Hal. Hal was a star football player in high school and Brooke's crush. He grew up to have a great career and lives in Brooke's dream home. Hal remembers that Brooke was the mastermind behind Brent's designs. He hires her to do the interior design of his home. Hal is in Brooke's soul mate section on her vision board. She believes everything she wants is coming true. But Brooke forgot one absolute truth: Be careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>This movie is about dreams and failures. Brooke had dreams but gave them up for love. Brooke consistently lost herself in her relationship with Brent. And she unknowingly repeats the pattern with Hal. It will drive the audience crazy to watch, but it often happens in life. This film provides the viewer with two twists at the conclusion. One you will predict, but the other is charming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love and Jane",
    "review":"Lilly leaves her home to attend the Jane Society. The society is a local group of Jane Austen enthusiasts that meet weekly to talk about Jane and her books. Lilly is the president and holds the meetings at a local English pub. When Lilly arrives, she realizes she forgot her copy of Pride and Prejudice. So she runs to Scribbler's Bookstore to buy another. Lilly grabs a copy, but the clerk, Trevor, grabs it too. She excuses his actions, but he says someone online purchased the book earlier. Trevor offers another option, but Lilly leaves.<br/><br/>After the meeting, the pub owner, Mr. Whitcomb, pulls Lilly aside. He decided to retire in a month and sell the pub. Lilly's friend, Alisha, assures Lilly that she will find a suitable replacement.<br/><br/>Later, Lilly meets her boyfriend, Martin, for dinner and gives him the unfortunate news. He has information that can help. Martin got a promotion. He wants Lilly to move with him and get married. Lilly doesn't want someone to rescue her from her life and says no. Lilly returns home, throws away her unfinished manuscript, and rests with an Austen book. She wishes to get wisdom and guidance from Jane, if only for a minute. Then, Lilly falls asleep.<br/><br/>Lilly wakes up to see an unknown woman standing over her. When Lilly threatens to call the police, the woman disappears. Lilly goes to work and finds Alisha crying after a phone call with her parents. Then, Brennan enters because their boss, Ellen, wants everyone in the boardroom. A leading app developer bought the largest bookstore in the city, Scribbler's, and wants them to create an ad campaign for it. Ellen considers Lilly and Alisha the top-tier creative team and puts them in charge. She introduced them to the app guru, Trevor. She thinks he will destroy her favorite store. Lilly goes home and begs for help. She wakes up to the mysterious woman again. But now, Lilly can see the woman is Jane Austen. Can Jane help show Lilly the correct path?<br/><br/>This movie looks like another love story at first glance. However, it's about the love Lilly has for the literary works of Jane Austen. Jane shows Lilly the ways of polite society and gives Lilly the courage to go after her dreams. However, she never condemns Lilly for her new-age ways. Jane gives Lilly a touch of culture and laughter. These moments of playfulness keep the script upbeat and fun. And the thought-provoking banter between Lilly and Trevor is tantalizing. This film is fun for all types of Jane Austen fans and Hallmarkies.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
