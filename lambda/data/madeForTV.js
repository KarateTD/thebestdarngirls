    "review":"Ella walks to the door to find the police questioning her father, Joey. They arrest Ella and bring her to jail. Joey calls his mother-in-law, Birdie, for help. Birdie runs a bakery while filming her reality show. Birdie's son, Gabe, is working on a deal to get a new location, and Birdie's niece, Janine, is the head of security.<br/><br/>Joey got Ella out of jail but with Birdie's help. Birdie and Ella's mom, Tasha, argued when Tasha left college to be with Joey after she got pregnant with Ella. Birdie convinces the homeowners to drop the charges if Ella moves from Texas to Chicago to live with Birdie. Ella agrees because it's either Birdie or jail.<br/><br/>Ella starts her first day of work at Birdie's Bakes but doesn't want to be on camera. Gabe lets Ella taste Birdie's Sweet T Potato Pie. Ella thinks it's ok but becomes vengeful when Gabe tells Ella that Birdie named it after Tasha because it was Tasha's recipe. After Ella takes a step back, she makes Tasha's pie and gives it to Birdie. Birdie is in heaven and wants the recipe. Ella promises to think about it. Zoe loves the moment and wants to reshoot it to make the exchange look presentable.<br/><br/>Later, Birdie shows her heirloom ring to Ella and promises to give it to Ella when Ella graduates college. Birdie lays in bed and asks Ella to bring her diabetes medication. Ella goes to her room to sleep but finds Birdie on the floor. She went into a diabetic coma but will be ok. Ella looks at Birdie's pills and notices one of them is different. She tells Janine immediately.<br/><br/>Ella goes to the hospital to check on Birdie, but a camera crew is there filming Birdie, Gabe, and Gabe's family. Birdie requests Gabe and Ella stay because she needs to update them on her health. Birdie has leukemia and wants to leave her business to Gabe and Ella equally. Bewildered, Gabe screams that Ella doesn't deserve it, but Birdie quotes Proverbs 13:22. Ella's unsure about the inheritance because she doesn't want to hurt Gabe. Birdie refuses to let her pride come between her relationship with Ella. Ella must be careful because pride will bring a tire iron, shadowy figures, threatening calls, and death.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie, unlike its predecessors, is different from the book but worth the watch. Everyone in this family is full of pride. Ella doesn't want Birdie's help because she is sticking up for Tasha. Birdie puts her pride before everything and displays the perfect family on TV. Gabe refuses to ask for assistance with the new location. He desires accolades but hides his failings. The script and cast will captivate you. So be ready with your tea and wine in hand.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
