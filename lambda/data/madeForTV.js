    "review":"Carly loves and celebrates all holidays and has an organized holiday closet filled with decorations and outfits. And this Thanksgiving will not be different. Her boyfriend, Brandon, loves Carly's enthusiasm but needs to focus on work this year. Carly's sister, Winnie, brings her husband, Kevin, and their two kids. Then, Carly and Winnie's mother, Judy, enters with her husband, Rufus. Winnie isn't happy to hear Judy brought their brother, Darnell. Winnie and Darnell fight like cats and dogs. Then, Carly's father, Martin, comes to the house with his new girlfriend, Destiny. Darnell asks her for ice, and Carly deciphers her family started eating without her. She erupts and kicks everyone out. Brandon tries to console her because he wants to propose tonight. Carly never wanted to get married because her parents' marriage ended horribly. Brandon decides he wants to take a break. This Thanksgiving is officially the worst for Carly.<br/><br/>Carly meets with her boss, Angela, after a failed Zoom call. A new boutique rental property wants Angela's team to write an article about the company after staying. Carly jumps at the opportunity to get away from her family and offers to stay for the article. Angela is confused about Carly's holiday switch but approves the assignment. Carly gives Winnie the key to her holiday closet and leaves her family for Christmas. Will she find the peace and serenity she needs?<br/><br/>Carly speaks for every person when she holds nothing back from her family. Between self-diagnosed food allergies, combative siblings, and squabbling parents, it's no wonder Carly caved. However, Brandon is the only victim of her wrath. One stand-out in this movie is the conclusion. In other stations, Carly would return in tears apologizing for leaving her family and with renewed Christmas spirit. For B.E.T., Carly loves her family, but the family discovers they overstepped and must make changes. It's a refreshing twist to a holiday film.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Joy wants her boss, Pierre, to promote her to Chief Executive Chef, so she invited an influencer, Cherrie, to rate the restaurant.

    "review":"Terrance pulls Noelle out of the pub's quiz bowl to give her fantastic news. He got the promotion and will head the new London office. This job will keep them apart for six months. Terrance thinks their relationship can withstand the distance, so they promise to stay together.<br/><br/>One year later, Noelle works at a publishing company and meets with her highest-selling author, Vincent. She gives him the latest edit on his book when a man with flowers walks into her office. It's Terrance. Then Terrance asks to go out to dinner later. Noelle goes home and starts going through her clothes with her sister, Shavana. Noelle doesn't want to believe it's a date, but she dresses to impress.<br/><br/>She meets Terrance at the restaurant and gets comfortable. Then another woman walks in and kisses Terrance. It's his new girlfriend, Noelle, but she prefers to be called Elle.

Sabrina tells Noelle that if she gets Elle for a book deal, the publisher company will give Noelle an imprint. Can the first Noelle work with the second while they are both in love with the same man?<br/><br/>Oh, the drama in the film is second to none. Noelle walks a razor's edge as she creates a marketing strategy for Elle's next book while devising tactics to get Terrance. And Noelle's brother-in-law, David, has one-liners every in-law is dying to say. It's easy to push this one aside because every holiday movie ends alike. But hang on because the ending will throw you for an honest loop. It is well worth the watch.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ella watches old videos of her grandfather, Riley, giving advice. He deemed Ella the successor of keeping the family together. Ella's family hasn't been the same since Riley died, but she will work tirelessly to keep his hope alive.<br/><br/>As Ella prepares to visit her family, her mother, Micah, calls her. Ella tells Micah she got the building to start her company but didn't sign the lease. Then, Micah tells Elle that Micah and Micah's mother, Tess, haven't gotten along since Riley's passing. Micah is ready to leave town and move to start a new life and a new bakery. Ella begs Micah not to tell Tess until after she arrives.<br/><br/>Ella walks into Chapel's Bakery to see Tess and Micah at odds. Ella can see Micah's resentment towards Tess's dismissive nature and wants to repair the bond like Riley.<br/><br/>After Christmas tree shopping, Tess, Micah, and Ella come to Tess's home to decorate the tree. They get the Christmas decorations and find Riley's Kwanzaa chest. Micah and Tess barely get through decorating without arguing. She meets with her ex-boyfriend, Mayor Griffin, for guidance, and Griffin notices the wedge between the two women. And if Christmas isn't enough, she will stay through Kwanzaa. But Ella spends too much time focusing on them and ignores her issues. Can these ladies come together before the new year?<br/><br/>These three women are so worried about losing each other that they drive the others away. While Tess ignores Micah's suggestions, she wants her around. Instead of opening up about her issues, Micah decides to run. Ella has one foot at home and the other at work. Losing their patriarch had a lasting impact on these women. It's sublime to see White Chocolate Peppermint Eclairs, Cranberry Brie Bites, Bûche de Noël, and Kwanzaa cookies bind these women to each other and their community.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Riley sees Everett decorating Mrs. Marley's front porch with Christmas garland and stops him. The town is ready to sell the home. Everett asks Riley what he has to do to save the house. Riley says Everett would have to pay the balance owed on the property taxes and the down payment. That's roughly $200,000.<br/><br/>Riley works in his office, and his assistant, Jeannie, runs in with a letter in a red envelope. Inside is a letter from Mrs. Marley with clues to a treasure map. When Riley was young, Mrs. Marley would make treasure maps for him and his friends, Everett, Tipper, Clay, Michelle, and Austin. Mrs. Marley instructed her lawyer to send the letters one year after she died.<br/><br/>Austin and Tipper own an event company, and they hooked a wealthy client with a wild party idea. The client likes the idea but doesn't think they have enough people and space to pull it off. They receive their letters. Tipper is excited, but Austin worries. The last time he saw Everett, they broke up.<br/><br/>Clay and Michelle are happily married with booming careers. They get their letters from Mrs. Marley. They don't care about the money, but they miss their friends and the hunt. They arrive at the property and speculate how much it's worth. These six friends will honor Mrs. Marley while finding a treasure and each other.<br/><br/>This endearing movie is reminiscent of P.S. I Love You. Mrs. Marley saw that Everett and Austin belonged together, and she created the hunt to help them see that. Also, her six letters had a ripple effect on Ricky, Clay, Michelle, Tipper, and the community. The movie is fun, but the pace slows down too many times.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
