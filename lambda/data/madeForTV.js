    "mtitle":"You Can't Take My Daughter",
    "review":"Amy celebrates passing the bar with friends and classmates, Owen and Letty.  When Owen’s trainer, Demetri, buys them a round of shots, Amy doesn’t drink it. They share a cab to head home.  Demetri lets Amy out of the cab but asks to come in for a nightcap.  She tells him no and goes home.  Later that night, she hears a knock at her door and assumes it’s her neighbor Chickie.  She opens the door and sees Demetri.  He beats and rapes her.  Since she knows her attacker, the police decide a rape kit isn’t necessary.  Amy is dumbfounded by their inability to help her.  Then, Demetri threatens her in a public parking lot in broad daylight.  After her restraining order, Amy discovers she’s pregnant.  She believes in a woman’s right to choose and she chooses to have her child.  When the cops finally question Demetri, they let it slip that Amy is pregnant.  Demetri ignores the restraining order and comes to Amy’s home with a gun.  He threatens to kill her and the unborn baby if she doesn’t drop the rape charge.  Amy decides she can’t wait for the police to protect her and her baby and move to Georgia to start a new life.   Years later, Amy is the proud and over-protective mother of Maddy.  She is served with custody papers.  Demetri wants custody and visitation of Maddy.  Since the rape charge happened in another state, it can’t be brought up in the custody case.  Amy’s fight will launch a change for all rape survivors and their children.<br/><br/>Be ready to scream and throw things at the screen after hearing every horrific statistic and every hurdle Amy has to jump over to keep her child safe.  Inspired by the true story of Analyn Megison, the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act was signed in 1995.  While this act was a huge step for survivors, Analyn is highly aware that most of the work has to be done at the state level.  So, check your state laws and be involved in making a change.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Is There a Killer in My Family?",
    "review":"Kevin is ready to have a real vacation with his wife Carly.  Carly is a writer who puts every ounce of herself into her latest true crime novel.  She was able to prove a woman killed her husband and had the woman put in jail for life.  Now, the couple will be staying at Crawford Island for a much-needed break.  On the mainland, Kevin attempts to take away Carly’s phone and laptop to make sure she doesn’t start working again.  Carly believes her grandfather was Crawford’s cousin’s wife.  Kevin is shocked to hear this news but she promises to take a vacation.  Then Carly hears about the mystery of Diana Crawford.  Diana was a young woman with a loving husband.  However, it was reported that she was seeing shadows in the woods.  Days later, she was found dead.  After the police cleared her husband, the legend is one of the shadowy figures killed her.  Carly decides to investigate the truth of Diana Crawford.<br/><br/>This movie is 75% build-up, 10% fight, and 15% wrap-up.  The build-up is so slow that you lose interest.  Unlike H.M.M. movies, you don’t get constant glimpses of the killer, more dead bodies, or the heroine’s life in danger to keep you watching.  When the final shocker is revealed, you are too bored to care.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Zombies 2",
    "review":"Zombies and Humans are getting along well in Seabrook.  All of the monster restrictions are gone and the barrier between Zombieland and Seabrook is open.  Zed is patiently waiting for Alison to come back from cheer camp but worries because she hasn’t answered any of his letters.  Addison is having fun at cheer camp but she worries because Zed hasn’t asked her to Prawn.  Addison is excited to try out for the new cheer captain and Zed is amped to run for president against Bucky.  As they leave cheer camp, Zed created an elaborate way to ask Addison to the Prawn.  But it goes wrong and the school bus crashes.  As Addison walks in the woods, she hears howling.  She believes it’s werewolves.  In the forest, Wyatt – a werewolf – saw Addison’s white hair and believes she is the Great Alpha.  It is believed the Great Alpha will help the pack find their long lost moonstone.  Each wolf cares a piece of the moonstone around their neck to help them transform.  However, their stones are losing their power.  They need to find the source of their power or they will all die.  The wolves find Addison school patch in the woods and go to Seabrook to find her.  The town freaks out because monsters are on campus and all the monster restrictions are enforced again.  Zed knows this means he and Addison can’t go to Prawn together.  Feeling out of place, Addison is ready to join.  Zed will do anything to stop her, even steal.<br/><br/>The sequel to Zombies covers a lot of hard-hitting topics for a kids/tween movie.  Topics like selling out your culture to fit into another.  Another topic, stealing from indigenous people.  The third topic, history being written by the winners.  Even today, these topics are still being contested in American history and the present.   Yes, these are heavy topics but it is done in a respectful manner that children understand.  So sit back and watch.  Then have a true and heartfelt discussion with your children about the topics it covers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Once Upon a Date",
    "review":"Josh is tired of playing Undercover Boss while his dad finishes all of his deals.   His dad approves but tells him to take his irresponsible brother, Anthony, with him on his next deal.  Josh’s next deal is for a hotel company.  However, they must get rid of the existing property before building.  The building is owned by Ed.  Ed runs the Happily Ever After Theater and he doesn’t have enough money to keep up the payments.  He is keeping this secret from everyone in the cast and crew, including his daughter Tiffany.  Tiffany is a writer and working on a play called Once Upon A Date.  After a few failed Romeos, Tiffany leaves the theater to get some fresh air.  She bumps into Josh walking with Anthony.  She assumes Josh is auditioning for the role and he takes the job to work undercover.  He hopes to find a win-win scenario for his dad’s takeover.  He told Tiffany he was an out of work actor and looking for a place.  She asks her friend Izzy to let him stay in the apartment she's fixing up for the next tenants.  Frank cuts off Anthony’s hotel stay and Anthony has to move in with Josh.  Anthony sees that Josh is falling for Tiffany and vice versa.  He reminds Josh that her heart will be broken when she learns the truth.  Anthony is starting to fall for Izzy.  He is helping her fix up the apartment, getting deals on tools, and trying to be a better man.  Josh tells Anthony when Izzy learns he was born with a silver spoon, she will be furious.  Josh and Anthony want to please their father but can they do it at the price of their happiness?<br/><br/>With 3 loves stories, 2 father-child relationships at risk, and 1 play, this movie could be a TV series.   It’s impressive that with only 2 hours, this movie handles so many complicated relationships.  You start to hope for the win-win scenario Josh is looking for in all his business deals.  While the overall plot of saving the theater for Tiffany’s happiness is predictable, this movie is still a fun watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
