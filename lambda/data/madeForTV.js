  "mtitle":"Black Girl Missing",
  "review":"Widow Cheryl eats breakfast with her daughters, Marley and Lauren. Cheryl is the vice principal at Marley's school, and Marley is an outcast that focuses on academic excellence. Lauren attends an ivy league school but tells Cheryl she wants to drop out. Lauren tells her mom she feels depressed, and Cheryl says she doesn't look depressed. Cheryl tells Lauren to keep her head down, press on, and stay in school as she did. Lauren gets angry at her mother's lack of sympathy and leaves home for campus early.<br/><br/>Two days later, Cheryl hears about missing blonde girl, Jessica, on the news. Jessica receives 24-hour news coverage, investigations, and search parties. Cheryl doesn't worry until she discovers that Lauren hasn't texted Marley either. Cheryl decides to go to the police and report Lauren missing. They tell Detective Dean everything they know. They hope the news about Lauren will spread like Jessica, but Cheryl and Marley are in for a rude awakening that will make them and Lauren another sad statistic.<br/><br/>This movie is an anthology of stories from families and friends of missing women of color. They get less news coverage and police attention than their counterparts. While this disparity was the movie's main focus, it covered many topics: depression in the black community, the Struggle Olympics, and the discrepancy between schools punishing minorities versus their counterparts. Cheryl has to contact the Black and Missing Foundation, Inc to find the terrible reality ahead of her. Most missing women of color go ignored and still missing. Finally, the film draws attention to cases by naming women that are still missing. And this list of little-known names will break your heart.

  "mtitle":"She Inherited Danger",
  "review":"Carly drives to Clearview when she gets a call from Sam, wanting her to return to New York. She left after he went to Las Vegas with the wedding fund for six days without notice. Carly tells Sam he has a gambling addiction, and their engagement is over. Carly drives to her grandfather's old and closed theater, Ritz, and sees an old friend, Marina. Marina lets Carly into the theater and inquires about Carly's intentions since Carly's grandfather, Gramps, died recently. Carly doesn't believe she knows how to run a theater and thinks she will sell it but keep her Gramps's house.<br/><br/>Carly meets with her Gramps's executor, Louis. Gramps left Carly his house, theater, all their contents, and a little money. She tells Louis that she plans on selling the theater, and he thinks it's a good idea because Gramps was behind on the property taxes. She mentions finding a real estate agent, and Louis directs her to James.<br/><br/>It takes a minute, but Carly remembers James from high school, but she used to call him Jimmy. She remembers Jimmy and his brother, Eric, as pranksters. James tells Carly that he and Eric cleaned up their act and Eric is a cop. She asks him to sell the Ritz, and James says yes. Carly goes to her newly acquired home and looks through old photos. In the back of a photo album, Carly finds a letter from Gramps. It's his last scavenger hunt. She completes all the tasks and finds a box full of 100-dollar bills. She calls James, cancels the sale, and asks Marina to help her manage it. Marina warns Carly it needs repairs. A waitress, Diane, tells them a handyman, Blake, came into the restaurant the other day and left his card. Carly thinks she is on a path to a new life and career, but Sam is hot on her heels. He wants her to sell it to cover his gambling debts. She is steadfast in keeping the Ritz, but someone else wants her to sell it, and they will murder Carly to get it.<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery that unveils itself to the viewers before Carly. When movies take this path, it's boring. However, this movie does it in such a fun and unique way. Like Gramps, this movie provides one massive scavenger hunt to a path of corruption with an intelligent cop. The script displaying each character's flaws makes this wild story more grounded in reality. This film is a delightful watch with a less-preachy message.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"My Diary of Lies",
  "review":"Natalie meets with the school guidance counselor, Mr. Monroe, before starting her first day of class. Mr. Monroe looked at her transcripts and saw that she was cheer captain. He encourages her to cheer for her new school because the squad has a spot open. At home, Natalie goes to her room to look up the cheer squad on the internet. She finds the video of Cassie's overdose and death at a party.<br/><br/>Natalie goes to Mr. Rexford's chemistry class. She thinks he is handsome, and he pairs her with Jake. Gina tells Natalie to be careful because Jake is Madison's boyfriend. Madison is the cheer squad captain and the queen bee of the school. Madison's best friend, Viv, is the co-captain. Gina wants to try out for the team like Natalie, so they go together. Then, the girls audition. A few days later, they pick Natalie to replace Cassie, and Gina tries to be happy, but she's hurt.<br/><br/>The team has their first party at Madison's house and plans to create a new routine. But they take a drug called Fabulous before doing anything else. She takes a few pills and kisses Jake. A few hours later, Natalie walks to the pool for fresh air and sees Viv arguing with someone, but Natalie is too high to determine who. The team finds Viv dead in the pool. To cope with her feelings, Natalie writes about everything in her diary. Unfortunately, someone steals Natalie's diary, alters its contents, and puts it online. Natalie's world falls apart. She must find her diary and repair her life before someone blames her for Viv's death.<br/><br/>This movie gives viewers more than they expected by misguiding them with clich√©s. You got a classic mean girl with loyal followers, an angsty unpopular girl, and a too-close teacher. We fall down the rabbit hole of usual suspects. Now don't give up so soon because the buildup takes time. But, the slow burn pays off and leaves the audience in shock. Don't watch this movie unless you can dedicate 100% of your attention.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Royal Rendezvous",
  "review":"Cat's manager, Dee, comes to Cat's food truck with great information. An Irish royal family wants Cat to fly to Ireland to cook for them and prepare a traditional royal banquet on her last day. And they want her to leave tomorrow. Cat says yes and heads to Ireland.<br/><br/>The driver leaves Cat on the front steps of the 12-bedroom home. Rory, the house manager, opens the door and assumes she is there for Lord James. He tells her to use the back door and slams it in her face. Then, James answers the door, and Cat instantly recognizes him. They had a one-night stand and agreed not to communicate again. Cat wants to leave, but James explains that he needs her. His grandmother, The Duchess, desires to sell the family's home and have them move closer to her. James hopes Cat's food will create a sense of warmth and home to persuade his grandmother to keep the property. Cat obliges.<br/><br/>Rory walks Cat to the kitchen, and she falls in love. James instructs Rory to take Cat to a bedroom above her station. Rory takes Cat to the sleeping quarters, and she jumps on the bed. Cat tries to get Rory to join her, but he refuses with a smile, one Cat enjoys. Chef Cat will get caught in a love triangle between Rory and James as she cooks for the family. Who will she choose?<br/><br/>It's strange for E Entertainment to get into the T.V. movie arena, but this film is perfect on this network. It's too raunchy for Hallmark and too sweet for Lifetime. The movie doesn't shy away from homosexuals kissing, calling out racism, and displaying classism. It's all done with the proper amount of racy humor and charm. Don't watch this and expect your grandmother's rom-com. However, it adds jokes and originality to a typical storyline.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"The Paramedic Who Stalked Me",
  "review":"Chloe and her friends, Bryce, Lexi, and Todd, spend their last days together before they graduate. Chloe has distanced herself from her mother, Karen. After texting, Karen calls Chloe to demand Chloe come home. As Chloe attempts to pacify Karen, a drunk driver, John, crashes into them. Karen calls the ambulance to Chloe's last known location.<br/><br/>The paramedics, Matt and Sharice, arrive on the scene to discover everyone alive but Todd. Matt uncovers Chloe has labored breathing, so he helps her with a bag valve mask and notices her necklace. While Chloe visits Lexi's hospital room, Matt goes into Chloe's room and takes her keys and necklace. Matt goes into John's room, handcuffs John to the hospital bed, and puts poison in John's I.V..<br/><br/>After a few days, Chloe is ready to leave the hospital when she gets a surprise visit from Matt. Chloe tells Matt she can't find her keys and necklace, and he pretends to assist in the search. He pulls the keys out of his pocket, acts like he's taking the keys out of the drawer, and gives the keys to her. Later, Matt comes to Chloe's door with her necklace wrapped around a teddy bear. Chloe loves the kind gesture and having her necklace back, but Karen worries. She believes that Matt overstepped his bounds. Karen thinks he will go away with a warning, but she is dead wrong. Matt will do anything to get Chloe.<br/><br/>Welcome back to old-school Lifetime. Matt is a delusional lovelorn man that kills to keep a teen that doesn't think much of him. Chloe is happy that Matt saved her life, but she has a boyfriend. It doesn't take long for Chloe to see that something isn't right about Matt. This movie has the worst break-in moments because Matt and Chloe have no idea what they are doing. Also, the final fight scene is electrifying. Give this movie your full attention and enjoy.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
