    "review": "Delilah notices her students are distracted and questions them. They found a blog post with Delilah's picture. She was a teen actress on a popular TV show that lasted 5 seasons. Although the network canceled the show years ago, it found a second life on streaming. New and old fans are clamoring for a reboot of the series. The studio listened and offered the previous cast their jobs, but Delilah didn't sign on.<br/><br/>Later, producer Barry and Delilah's mother, Miranda, attempt to entice Delilah but to no avail. Fans leave nasty comments when they learn she is the only holdout. Delilah tries to ignore the online hate until it enters reality with a rock through her window and threats in her mailbox. The police offer little comfort, so Delilah runs to her favorite coffee shop.<br/><br/>Delilah's regular barista, Ellen, commiserates with Delilah. Then, Ellen offers Delilah a place to stay while Delilah waits for the police to find the culprit. Delilah, in fear for her life, graciously accepts Ellen's offer and moves into Ellen's apartment. Ellen hides her obsession with Delilah and the TV show well. She gained Delilah's trust and will never let her go. Can Delilah escape Ellen's clutches?<br/><br/>Ellen's deranged fantasies have a root cause. She grew up in an abusive home and delved deeper into the show to escape. Delilah's world as Chelsea appears easy and carefree because the character's problems end in 30 minutes. Delilah's reality is less glamorous. The script gives the audience painful backstories, so you sympathize with both characters. Ellen is unhinged but very smart. Ellen outthinking Delilah at every turn while maintaining a job is funny. This plot, acting, and fight scenes make this movie a comedy more than a thriller. So viewers should come for the chills and stay for the laughter.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Gabby approaches her stepsister's home. She hasn't heard from her pregnant stepsister, Eliza, and knows Eliza should have given birth by now. Gabby doesn't know the baby's father, but Eliza calls him Blue.<br/><br/>Gabby goes to Eliza's job to talk to her co-workers. Her boss, Kate, voices concern for Eliza's whereabouts. Kate informs Gabby that Eliza worked closely with Kate's ex-husband, Aiden. Then, Eliza's husband, Jake, enters. He doesn't know much about Eliza but offers to help.<br/><br/>Gabby returns to Eliza's home and wonders if she ever knew her. Then, Gabby gets a terrifying call. The police found Eliza's body, but her baby girl is missing. Gabby is determined to uncover who killed Eliza and locate her niece. The first step is uncovering Blue's identity. Will Gabby find the truth before she loses her niece, too?<br/><br/>The plot describes Gabby and Eliza as caring but not close. Gabby lived in Paris, while Eliza resided stateside. It's understandable why these stepsisters maintained a distance and had secrets. The clues lead to several suspects, but they won't fool seasoned Lifetimers. The title makes zero sense, the culprit's motives are standard, and the sleuthing is too easy. This movie's saving grace is the realistic conclusion. The audience will breathe a sigh of relief. However, viewers should leave this movie on the back burner.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Murder at the Derby",
    "review": "Horse trainer Reggie tells his assistant, Kara, that he must let her go. However, he isn't firing her but giving her a better opportunity with Rosemont Farms. The COO, Jenny, wants new blood to train her horses. The farm isn't profitable after Jenny's brother, Stephen, acquired horrible deals.<br/><br/>Jenny introduces Kara to the horses and her nephew, Justin. Later, Kara meets the family's matriarch, Evelyn, and Jenny's brother, Stephen. Kara overhears the Rosemont family's antagonistic relationship. Stephen believes the company should be his and that his family fights against him. However, Evelyn grows tired of his antics. She tells Stephen she will leave Jenny in charge and write him out of the will. He drugs and smothers Evelyn before she changes her will. However, he's still under Jenny's control. He will take down anyone or anything in his path and has the perfect scapegoat: Kara. Can Kara uncover his evil deeds before the police send her to jail for murdering Evelyn?<br/><br/>This movie has everything Lifetimers crave. The body count isn't high, but the drama reels you into the plot. Viewers will revel in Jenny's take-charge attitude and Evelyn's steady hand. While Stephen is the antagonist, you won't be able to ignore him. His suits, voice, and slick hair make him a villain from head to toe. Kara isn't a wilting flower. She fights back and won't allow Stephen to scare her. Fans will love this film from beginning to end. It's old-school Lifetime that the fans deserve.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Love Club Moms: Tory",
    "review": "Tory arrives at the school of her goddaughter, Mara, and runs into Mara's mom, friend Nila. Tory is excited to share that she adopted a baby girl, Alison. But widow Nila escaped so Mara wouldn't see her tears. As Tory comforts Nila, they hear a scream. It's Heather. Her husband, Lance, asked for a separation. Nila focuses on Heather and urges Tory to join her. The three see soon-to-be principal Jo talking with a flirty teacher. A passerby calls them The Love Club. Confused, the four women - Tory, Nila, Heather, and Jo - look behind them and see a banner with those words written on it. They decide to work together to support each other through love, work, and friendship. Their first task is to help Tory find a nanny.<br/><br/>Finn arrives at Lipton Publishing with his manuscript. He requests to see Tory, but her assistant puts the manuscript at the bottom of Tory's 'read' pile. Finn leaves and drives to Tory's home. Finn knocks on the door, and Tory answers with the Love Club nearby. They assume he's there to interview for the nanny position. Tory hires him after he saves Alison's life, and Finn goes home without saying a word.<br/><br/>Tory returns to the office and greets her father. Her father introduces Tory to Greg. He runs the publishing company's London offices. Tory runs to the Love Club and tells her friends that Greg checks most of her boxes. She needs to determine if he will be a good dad. As the Love Club gets to know Finn more, they think he is the perfect man for Tory. Jo warns them that Tory will hold on to Greg unless they prove he's not Mr. Right. Will the Love Club make the love connection before Tory uncovers Finn's ulterior motives?<br/><br/>This film is the first part of a four-part series. It gives viewers a brief introduction to each Love Club member and their different positions in life. The ladies are funny as they meddle in Tory's life to distract Greg and promote Finn. The first interaction between Finn and the Love Club is comedy gold. However, the script fizzles after the first interaction and falls into the love story clich√©s. The plot, like the conclusion, becomes dreadfully predictable. Hopefully, the upcoming three movies will offer more.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The POstables meet at Ramon's restaurant for brunch. Rita and Shane notice that the other isn't enjoying a mimosa. They're pregnant. Ramon approaches the table as the four celebrate with a well-worn letter that his crew found during renovations. They open the letter at the table and read its contents. The sender didn't leave their name or identifiable information.<br/><br/>The POstables return to the Dead Letter Office with the letter, and Charley is there with her baby. They give Charley the letter, and she recognizes some of the wording as lyrics. The singer, Nate, stated that he writes his songs. However, the letter proves otherwise. They discover he's performing in Las Vegas. So, Norman rents an RV, and the POstables take their show on the road.<br/><br/>The POstables arrive in Las Vegas and catch Nate backstage. He admits the truth. He was in love with a talented runaway named Tracy. She wrote songs and had an incredible voice. However, she didn't want to be in the spotlight. She confessed that she had to hide from something terrible. Tracy kissed him and told him to check his mailbox. Since then, Tracy has sent him music with changing P.O. box information for payment. Nate believes Tracy wrote the letter. The POstables are on a mission to find Tracy and the intended recipient. They will unleash devastating secrets and create cascading pain, causing them to wonder if they should deliver this letter.<br/><br/>This Signed, Sealed, Delivered movie has the POstables questioning their job for the first time. They must fulfill their duties as federal authorities while sympathizing with the writer's plight. They discover that doing the right thing may not always feel good. While this mystery focuses on a moral dilemma, the two subplots center around Oliver. Oliver contends with the father who stayed versus the one who left. This mental struggle happens often in today's socio-political climate. This heartfelt discussion is a first for the series that avoids honest issues. It's wonderful to see the writers grow. They allowed the audience and characters to get uncomfortable, acknowledge the feeling, and deal with it maturely. This picture will be a favorite in the series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
