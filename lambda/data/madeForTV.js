    "mtitle":"Maid for Revenge",
    "review":"Annie, a maid, comes to her appointment and finds a note on the front door inviting her inside. She cleans the house from top to bottom and finds a pitcher of cucumber water with a sign to help herself. Annie drinks some and continues to clean. Hours later, Annie wakes up beside the pool with her phone and a dead body at the bottom. She leaves and finds a car with the keys inside. Annie jumps in, thinking it's her lucky day, only to have the owner, Billy, knock on the window. She carefully tells him what happened without mentioning the murder. Annie explains that her son, Tate, is with the babysitter, Katy. Now, she has to get home to Tate. Billy offers to drive Annie home.<br/><br/>Annie doesn't find Tate or Katy at home and starts to panic. She borrows Billy's phone to call Katy. Katy relays that Tate is with his grandmother, Elizabeth. Annie breathes a sigh of relief and gives Billy his phone. Annie retrieves Tate from Elizabeth, who is happy to watch him.<br/><br/>Annie drops Tate off at Elizabeth in the morning and sees her lawyer, Hank. She tells Hank everything that happened. And worst of all, she knew the victim, Lydia. Lydia was a juror in Annie's trial. Annie was convicted of vehicular manslaughter and spent two and a half years in jail. He warns Annie to turn herself in to the police and trust the justice system. Annie scoffs at Hank's suggestion and decides to find out who is setting her up. And she knows just where to start: Billy.<br/><br/>This movie has everything viewers want: spiked drinks, dishonorable thieves, and money. Please, pay attention because everything is a hint. It's obvious why Annie ran once you get to know her. But her trust in Billy seems laughable after meeting him the day before. However, Billy is a resourceful person with a glass jaw. This movie will have you guessing until the end and cheering for Annie. This captivating mystery proves that Lifetime can do a movie right.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost",
    "review":"Jane de Silva fixes her makeup backstage. Then, Detective John calls her name. Jane has never seen John before. But he knows her uncle, Harold, and her aunt, Sadie. Sadie sent John to find Jane and inform her that Harold passed away and left her an inheritance.<br/><br/>Jane arrives in Baltimore and runs into Sadie's arms for comfort. John enters to explain Jane's inheritance. After Harold retired, he started a P.I. firm called Foundation for Righting Wrongs. Harold took cases that police deemed cold or didn't have the labor force to solve. Harold wanted Jane to take it over. Jane doesn't understand why Harold picked her. She has zero investigating experience.<br/><br/>Jane opens a box and looks through a case file but resigns after a few pages. Then she hears a rattle on the window. Lia came for help after hearing about the foundation. She snuck out to get past her father, Kenny. Lia's mother, Linda, died hours after removing Linda's inheritance from her bank account. Lia knows finding the money is hopeless, but she wants to know what happened to Linda. Jane lost her mother to a hit-and-run, and they never found the killer. Jane couldn't help herself. So she needs to help Lia. Can Jane solve her first case?<br/><br/>Based on A Hopeless Case by K.K. Beck, this movie has MLMs, wigs, and singing. The mystery doesn't start immediately like other H.M.M. movies because it takes time to develop a backstory for Jane, Sadie, and John. Unlike most protagonists, Jane doesn't have a background in murder, puzzles, or intrigue. Sadie shows Jane how to put her skills to use. John gives Jane tips on how to read a police report and question suspects. They are her detective think tank. This enigma provides the audience with plenty of suspects and motives. But the overall motivating force and means of execution are horrifying at its core. This film is a strong kickoff for a new series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"When Love Springs",
    "review":"Rory's parents, Lyla and Tom, are having a vow renewal at Lily Lake Bed and Breakfast. Rory and her sister, Cleo, are excited to attend, but Rory's boss, Melody, expects Rory to be on call and work. Rory obtained a five page-spread for Melody's client, and Melody wants Rory to create a press plan. Rory makes a draft and meets Cleo at the elevator.

Rory sits with Noah and opens up about her fears, passions, and past. Noah talks about his family legacy, takes trips around the property, and tells Rory why he left the high-pressure analyst world behind. Their open and honest conversations make you fall in love with them as a couple. Noah's final desperate apology will bring tears to your eyes.

    "mtitle":"Abducted on Prom Night",
    "review":"Four weeks ago, a man in a fake rideshare car tried to kidnap Kimber after a party. Kimber's mom, Principal Shawna, wants to keep Kimber under lock and key. Lately, Kimber acts out in class and cheats. Her teacher sends Kimber to Shawna's office. Kimber leaves in a huff and joins her friend, Everleigh.<br/><br/>After classes, Kimber finds a prom-posal on her locker from her boyfriend, Austin. Kimber excepts Austin's invitation. Everleigh and Kimber walk down the school steps as Joan approaches. Joan tells Kimber that she misses their friendship and would like to spend more time together like they did when they were best friends. Kimber asks Joan to be her plus 2 for prom, much to Everleigh's chagrin.<br/><br/>Austin gets a limo for himself, Kimber, Joan, Everleigh, and Everleigh's boyfriend, Luke. The driver tells them they can't drink, rough house, or put their limbs outside the limo. And Shawna tells them no alcohol. They agree to the driver and Shawna's conditions. Austin snuck alcohol on board, much to Kimber's surprise. Everyone but Joan does shots as the driver takes them to Austin's next surprise. He decided to take Kimber and the group to the place he and Kimber had their first date. As they laugh, the driver makes a video of them drinking. He threatens to take them home if they don't abstain from alcohol for the remainder of the night and relinquish their phones. The driver puts their phone under the front wheel, gets in the limo, and drives over them. It doesn't take long for the group to realize they are going in the wrong direction. The driver locks the doors, rolls up the windows, and tells them to do what he says or die.<br/><br/>Wow, there are so many mistakes it's difficult for viewers to feel bad for them. And their mistakes cost one member of the group their life. There are hints of the motive sprinkled throughout the plot. And the perpetrator's monologue will tie it all together. When the dust settles, one person will be the undeniable villain of this story, and it's not the kidnapper.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
