    "review": "Rebecca West feigns understanding when another track mom informs her that her daughter, Lory, is not the captain. Later, Rebecca confronts Lory about this without admitting the secret. Lory infers that Rebecca is talking about her prom date, Austin. Lory's confession floors Rebecca. She begs for forgiveness, but Rebecca grounds Lory until after the prom.<br/><br/>After hearing kind words about Austin, Rebecca lifts Lory's restrictions. Later, Austin tosses rocks at Lory's window. He persuades her to sneak out for a party. Until she returns home to find Rebecca in the kitchen with rage in her eyes. Rebecca takes Lory's phone and bans her from prom. Rebecca reads the message and panics. Austin got them a hotel room for prom night and planned to move to California with Lory. Rebecca must control Lory so Lory won't ruin the plan Rebecca has for their lives. She will become the people she feared the most: her parents.<br/><br/>Rebecca comes home and asks Lory to help her clean out an old family cellar. She will keep Lory down there until after prom. Rebecca wants Lory to suffer a hard lesson, just as her parents made her suffer. Lory screams for forgiveness, but Rebecca locks the cellar.<br/><br/>Rebecca chaperones the prom and tells everyone Lory is ill. Austin wants to check on Lory, so he sneaks out of the prom and breaks into Rebecca's home. When he doesn't find Lory, he alerts the police. As they post missing-person flyers, the police clear Austin while Rebecca becomes an internet sensation. People can't get enough of the grieving widow with a missing child. Rebecca basks in the glory she never received. Soon, Lory will be a liability instead of an asset. Will Lory escape the cellar?<br/><br/>The only way to review this film is O.M.G.. Rebecca is a victim who becomes an oppressor. The writers ease the audience into her level of crazy. This expertly scripted film leaves you in fear for Lory while fearing Rebecca. You have no idea how unhinged she will become. You cheer for the one person in Lory's corner until they are in Rebecca's web. One interesting spin is that Rebecca trapped Lory, but her words gave Lory the strength to fight. As one woman sang for ego, the other sang for hope. The acting feels flat, but it amplifies Rebecca's cold heart. This movie is the stuff of nightmares, but in a good way.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Doctor with Two Faces",
    "review": "Nurse Carol shows her new co-worker, Nurse Sheyla, the ropes around the hospital when Doctor Derek Calico introduces himself. Carol deduces that Derek captivates Sheyla. Carol invites Sheyla out for drinks after work with Nurse Grant. Sheyla accepts the impromptu invitation.<br/><br/>Carol looks over and sees Derek at the bar. Carol and Grant leave, so Sheyla and Derek can have time alone. Sheyla and Derek flirt at the bar and wake up in bed together. She worries her late-night romp will cloud his judgment of her, but he vows to remain professional at work and respect her.<br/><br/>Sheyla notices an angry Doctor Henry Morris talking to a nurse. Carol informs Sheyla that Henry is on the warpath. Pills from the in-house pharmacy are missing. He approaches Carol and Grant and asks them to research the missing pills. Carol believes it's a clerical error, but agrees to investigate it.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, Sheyla and Derek are in wedded bliss. He envisioned a stay-at-home wife for his illustrious career. She scoffs at the idea because she wants to feel useful. Derek sighs and relents. Sheyla sprints upstairs because she feels dizzy and takes a pregnancy test. It's positive. Carol sympathizes but encourages Sheyla to be honest. She believes Derek will be elated. However, Carol can't be farther from the truth. Derek is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Who will be left standing when Derek shows the world who he really is?<br/><br/>This plot will have Lifetimers clutching their pearls. Sheyla falls for a textbook narcissist. He gaslights her, manipulates his colleagues, and kills anyone who stands in the way of his power. And his body count starts in the first 20 minutes. The actors played their characters superbly. Now, viewers will make assumptions about the missing pills, but you are half correct. It allows others to enter the plot and add more complex layers to the story. This film will not completely capture your attention, but it has well-written highlights that serve as a cautionary tale.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mystery Island: Play for Keeps",
    "review": "Jason and Emilia created a new game for their guest. This mystery differs because Janey and Jason will become characters in the plot. Janey exhales and confesses a substantial detail to Emilia. The person who booked the VIP Mystery Island experience was Attorney Ainsley Trask. She married Emilia's ex-fianc√©, billionaire CEO Franklin Trask. Emilia grits her teeth and continues setting up the game.<br/><br/>Ainsley and Franklin arrive with smiles. They brought friends and family with them. Franklin's brother, former NFL tight end Spencer, worked for Trask's company until Franklin pushed him out. Spencer brought his model girlfriend, influencer Patricia, along to join in the fun. Ainsley's best friend, high school teacher Mickey, arrives, but spends his time staring at Ainsley. COO Viveca is Franklin's business partner and trusted confidante. Franklin discreetly hands Emilia a note as he passes. He wants to meet with her privately.<br/><br/>Emilia gives the guests the game's backstory and first clue. To everyone's surprise, Ainsley solves the crime in a few hours. Emilia cautiously awards Ainsley the prize, but believes she cheated. They sit for dinner, and Franklin finds a note asking him to meet Emilia later. He finds her at the end of the path and professes his love for her. Ainsley overhears him. She demands a separate bedroom, and Emilia obliges. Everyone returns to their room for the night.<br/><br/>No one can find Ainsley in the morning. They search the premises and find Ainsley's bloody body in the basement. Jason calls Chief Ray to survey the scene and investigate the players. After the first round of questioning, Emilia realizes that she is a suspect. Emilia will find Ainsley's killer to clear her name.<br/><br/>This latest Mystery Island installment adds a new layer to Emilia's backstory and reinforces the potential romance between Emilia and Jason. However, this film differs because Emilia is in the crosshairs. Typically, Jason allows her to investigate with him. But he wants her to step aside for her safety. This film isn't as funny as its predecessor, but Janey lightens the heavy topic. However, this mystery is far superior to the others. It will leave you guessing the culprit and the motive until the big reveal. This film will stump you and have you begging for more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Dead Girl Summer",
    "review": "Avery received a text message from her ex-boyfriend, Will. He asks her to return to her family's summer home because he has information about their friend Mia. Avery and her best friend, Jade, will return for their final summer break after graduating from college. It's been four years since they visited because Mia's death was more than they could bear.<br/><br/>Avery and Jade relax at Avery's family home before walking to Will's home. However, he isn't there. His new girlfriend, Daniella, greets them. She tells them that Will is working at the boat repair shop, and they travel to his workplace. However, they run into Mia's ex-boyfriend, Eric, along the way. They blame him for Mia's passing.<br/><br/>Avery and Jade attend a bonfire with locals when they spot Will and Daniella. They ask him about the messages, but he didn't send them. Avery and Jade make the most of their vacation and have a fun night until Avery gets drunk. Will takes Avery home while Daniella and Jade stay behind.<br/><br/>Avery dreams of the night Mia died. They went to a bonfire, and Mia argued with Eric. Avery, Jade, Mia, and Will got drunk and had fun after Eric left. Avery, Jade, and Will woke up with mysterious marks and remembered they had gone cliff diving. They couldn't find Mia, so they phoned her. They found her phone and shoes in the field nearby. Days later, fishers found Mia's body in the river.<br/><br/>Avery wakes with a pounding headache. She looks for Jade but can't find her. She contacts Will and Daniella, but they haven't seen Jade either. Jade is missing. With the feeling of looming dread, someone is haunting Avery. Can Avery find Jade before Jade ends up in the river too?<br/><br/>This film has a Cruel Summer concept, but falls short. Differentiating between scenes from the past and today is difficult. The intertitle appears on the screen once, stating it's '4 years ago.' However, the characters, clothing, or shot composition don't change to reflect it. Typically, Lifetime police officers are useless while the main characters make idiotic mistakes. The culprit of Mia's murder and Jade's disappearance is as compelling as the motive. The script has a limited number of characters, making it easy to narrow the suspect list. This film should be on Freeform, not Lifetime.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Providence Falls: Thief of Fate",
    "review": "Cora wakes in the hospital with her father, James, and best friend, Suzette, by her side. She remembers the kiss she shared with Liam. She's stunned that he's not there. James wants Cora to rest and recuperate, but she wants to get back to work. Magnus is in holding, and Merideth is still missing.<br/><br/>Bael sits beside Agon at a bar. He tells Agon to leave Cora and Liam alone to decide their fate. He knows Agon is having second thoughts about taking Cora's will and pushing her into Finn's arms. Agon hesitates when Salaem appears. She vows to find the human in Bael's clutches. Salaem warns Agon that if they don't fix Cora's fate, Gabriel will get involved.<br/><br/>Cora arrives home to find Liam on the porch waiting for her. He apologizes for not being by her side, but he thought they needed distance. They arrive at the police station to interrogate Magnus. Then, Bael appears as Magnus's lawyer. Agon reminds Liam to stay the course and bring Cora to her true love: Finn.<br/><br/>During the investigation, Magnus claims Cora pinned the investigation on him because he rejected her advances. She and Liam will find the culprit. However, she must get past her dreams of him and focus. Liam will help her solve the case while pushing her toward Finn. Will it work because Finn is falling for Suzette? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Based on Thief of Fate by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets, this third film in the series answers the final question of will versus fate. Your favorites return with a satisfying conclusion to their stories. However, the third act has more information to reveal. The plot is intriguing and heartwarming. The Ireland flashbacks flow naturally with the storyline, connecting the past to the present. Agon continues to be a comic relief with soul, while Salaem keeps you grounded. This movie series will have a permanent place on your DVR and make you consider a Hallmark+ subscription.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
