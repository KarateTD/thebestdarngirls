She visits his office to surprise him and catches him with another woman.  Since she is in her late 30s and he wants a family, she decides to try to make it work.  Joe gets transferred to New York and their problems magnify.

But you can't tell her that because she will get mad at you.  So you suffer in silence while she complains and defends him in the same breathe.  Based on a novel by the same name, the story is well written.  But it doesn't properly identify Alice's relationship as emotional abuse.
