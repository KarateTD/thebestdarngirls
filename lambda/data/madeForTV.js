    "review":"Seven months after being mugged on the street, Rachel moves to the suburbs with her boyfriend, Peter.  She is pregnant with their first child and hates when Peter treats her like glass.  While Rachel is out of work, Peter suggests Rachel get to know the neighbors.  First, she sees Gary across the street, but he doesn't acknowledge her presence.  Then, Rachel goes to the bakery and meets Gary's wife, Grace. After grocery shopping, Rachel meets mommy blogger Yvonne. Next, Rachel meets Sandy, who believes everyone is strange but harmless. Later that night, Rachel hears a noise downstairs.  She grabs a melon and prepares to attack.  But it's Peter's controlling mother, Patricia. One day, Rachel looks out the window and sees Yvonne's husband kissing the nanny, and Yvonne comes home.  Yvonne comes up the steps and catches them.  Then, Yvonne raises her hand to strike the nanny, but they move out of Rachel's view.  Rachel calls the police.  The police inform Rachel that the nanny wasn't there, and Yvonne wants to file a complaint against Rachel.  Now, Rachel is the neighborhood outcast, and her doctor put her on bed rest due to high blood pressure. With everyone believing Rachel is slipping into madness, she thinks someone is trying to steal her baby.  Now, can she convince anyone else?<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Rear Window, this movie gets crazier by the minute.  Every neighbor is a bit off, and Rachel only adds to the fire by monitoring them.  But as the old saying goes, 'Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.' One poignant facet of this movie is Rachel and Peter's growth at the end.  They both learn to stand up for themselves and each other.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After losing a big client, Sadie returns to Westwood Hills.  She's ready to leave the marketing world behind and work in her parents' candy shop for the holidays.  Then, her parents drop a bomb.  They are selling the business and retiring. Sadie believed her parents would give the shop to her someday, so she is heartbroken to be left out.  She goes to the candy shop to meet with her father and the new buyer, Alex. Sadie believes Alex is off to a bad start because he's late. When Alex arrives, Sadie tells him he must learn how to create the chocolates they make in the store. While they cook, Alex questions why they don't outsource their candy so they can carry more.  She explains this is how her father did it, and she will keep it going. Then Sadie gets an idea, and she wants to throw her parents a retirement party.  She believes it will be easy, and she can make each guest a personal gingerbread house.  Teaching and party planning get off to a great start until Sadie gets her parents' guest list.  They have more than 100 people attending.  Sadie will have to do something she has never done before, depend on others.  With the challenge, Sadie will rediscover her talent for making candy while falling for Alex.<br/><br/>This movie will leave you with more questions than answers.  For example, what happened to Michael, Sadie's ex-boyfriend. He left Sadie a message, but she ghosted him.  While that is the typical thing to do nowadays, that's not explained in the story. Now don't be mistaken, this movie will whet your appetite, and the main characters have chemistry.  But you will find yourself hungry and confused as the credits roll.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

You can skip this movie this holiday season.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rachel wants her father, Dennis, to sell his veterinary clinic and retire.  She works there and hopes to use her portion of the money to start a music store.  After finishing at the clinic, Rachel goes to a restaurant, but they don't have a reservation for her and her boyfriend, Brad.  As she waits for a table to open, Rachel waits for Brad to come.  By the end of the night, he never shows, and Rachel ends the relationship.  The next day, she goes into a cafe and sees Sophia looking up vocal videos on-line.  Rachel offers her services, but Sophia's father, Michael, declines.  Rachel leaves, but Michael's sister, Emma, vouches for Rachel.  So, Michael runs after her and accepts Rachel's offer to give vocal lessons to Sophia.  Rachel promises that Sophia can get there with practice and by not beating herself up.  Rachel then invites them to a Christmas carnival with a bake sale for the play.  However, bake sales are down, and they still need $2,000 to buy costumes.  So, Michael challenges Rachel to the sale-off, and the loser will pay for dinner.  As the sales fly, so does the sparks.  But when Brad comes to town with a ring, will the sparks die?<br/><br/>The significant moments in this movie are the singing and the love between Dennis and Brad's mom, Donna.  While Brad is a jerk, he makes for an entertaining film. Other than that, this movie doesn't stand out much in this holiday season. While it has funny aspects, you won't watch it again.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
