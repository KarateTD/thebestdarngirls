    "review":"Police are called to a bloody crime scene.  They find hundreds of pills, a dead mother, and a missing daughter.  As they search for Esme, they learn the horrible truth about her mother, her illness, and her boyfriend.  Inspired by the story of Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose, this movie will make you question if justice was served.  Pay attention.  The first 40 minutes are told from Camile's point of view and the rest from Esme's.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Samantha comes back to her hometown hoping to avoid her ex-boyfriend and superstar athlete Jake.  Only to learn Jake is staying at her dad's house.  As they help prepare for SnowComing, the spark between Jake and Samantha grow.  But can one nosey reporter bring it all down?  The individual stories of the characters' growth is more interesting than the love story.  It follows the Hallmark format too closely but their growth saves the movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

She won't have to worry about a long distance relationship because her boyfriend, Will, is attending the same school.  When he is murdered, Tessa goes on a path of self-destruction that started before she was born.  This movie just doesn't grab your attention even with the plot twist.

Then she learns her friend Jade was a call-girl and her killer maybe a member of the app.  She decides to keep the app open and find the killer.  Unlike most mysteries, no hint of the killer is given until the last 10 minutes.  You will have fun speculating with each new person who enters Trina's life.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
