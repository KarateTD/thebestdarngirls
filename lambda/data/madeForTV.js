    "review": "Lisa Velez dances with her headphones on, and her father hits her from behind. Lisa begs Mrs. Velez to call the police, but she won't. Lisa puts on her headphones and escapes into the music.<br/><br/>Mrs. Velez leaves Mr. Velez, and Lisa's brother, Eladio, helps Mrs. Velez care for the family. He urges Lisa to get a job and stop dreaming about being a singer. A co-worker says he knows Jellybean and can introduce Lisa. Lisa takes her co-workers and Eladio to the club. Her co-worker admits he doesn't know Jellybean and Brit leaves. Lisa stands by the side of the bar, and Toni spies Lisa's scheming. She tells Lisa to grab a tray to get backstage. Lisa takes her advice.<br/><br/>Jellybean talks to his bandmates Mike and Spandador. Mike wants to start a band but can't find a singer. Lisa enters the room and sings. She blows them away, and Mike gives Lisa his number. Later, Lisa shows executive Barry and manager Rocco her undeniable talent. They offered Lisa a contract, but she's underage. Lisa brought Mrs. Velez to the studio and begged her to sign it. Mrs. Velez doesn't trust them, but Lisa pleads with her mom. Lisa wants to make her family's dreams come true. Mrs. Velez gives in to Lisa. Lisa sees her historic future ahead of her but doesn't see the physical, emotional, and mental toll it will take on her personal and professional life.<br/><br/>This movie embodies the late 1980s with fashion and technology. The musical montages set the mood by playing historical clips covering politics, sports, and TV. The lead actress mastered Lisa's distinct voice and choreography. This film will gain new fans while long-time fans will dance and remember good times. It doesn't give you all the details, but you will watch with satisfaction.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Lingerie designer Ruby tirelessly works to promote her brand. While resting at home, she hears someone trying to open her front door. It's a man looking for her ex-boyfriend, investigative reporter Luke. She tells him Luke isn't their and won't be. Ruby updates her best friend, photographer Ella, about the encounter.<br/><br/>Later, Ella believes Ruby thrives in every aspect of her life except love and wants to help. She got an access code to a dating app for millionaires. Ella grabs Ruby's phone, downloads the app, enters the code, and creates a profile for Ruby. She returns Ruby's cell phone and tells Ruby to activate the profile when she's ready.<br/><br/>Ruby is relaxing at home when she hears someone entering the front door. It's Luke. He warns her to fix the lock and asks if they can get intimate again. Ruby tells him that was a one-time mistake. Ruby pushes Luke out and activates her profile. After looking through several suitors, she matches with Dylan.<br/><br/>Ruby shows Ella and Ruby's assistant Dylan's photo, and Ruby's assistant recognizes him. He was on a popular dating show and proposed to the winner, Grace. Ruby goes on a date with Dylan anyway. Ruby has a wonderful time and chooses to spend the night with Dylan. Ruby freshens up in the morning and finds women's clothes in the closet. She graciously leaves while Dylan makes breakfast. She thinks it will be the last time she sees Dylan. Ruby is sadly mistaken. Dylan is a liar, stalker, and murderer. No one is safe.<br/><br/>This film is what Lifetimers expect from the network. It uses today's technology and pop culture to propel the story. The protagonist makes blaring errors in her personal life that will make you scream at the TV. This movie differs from others because you don't get the villain's monologue. We never understand why Dylan delights in evil. The audience learns how he got help but not his motive. This picture entertains you, but the protagonist will frustrate you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Perfect Setting",
    "review": "Rosie encourages her friend Abby to show her jewelry designs to their boss, Nadia. Nadia flips through Abby's designs but won't consider them because Abby isn't a known designer. Then, banker Jules calls Abby from Belgium. Her grandfather's jewelry store, Vanderbrinks, is in the arrears. Abby uses her PTO and flies to Antwerp.<br/><br/>Abby notices the changes in the Antwerp Diamond District while walking to Vanderbrinks. An upset woman bumps into Abby. The woman's diamond fell out of her ring, and she came to Remy and Sons to fix it. But the store is closed. Abby takes out her tools, hands her purse to Remy and Sons's Alexander, and repairs the ring on the street. Alexander warns his father, Pieter, that a Vanderbrink stole their client.<br/><br/>Abby spends time with her grandfather, Laurent, and discusses the upcoming Valentine's Day Diamond Contest. Every year, the winner was either Remy and Sons or the Vanderbrinks. Laurent wants Abby to enter their contest for his store. Abby is unsure until she meets with Alexander on the street. They verbally joust, and she declares her contest entry. Later, Pieter admits he entered Alexander into the competition.<br/><br/>Abby sends a check to Jules but learns it's not enough. Laurent is 6 months behind. Abby goes on a walk and sees Alexander sketching his design. He confessed that he handles the business end of Remy and Sons. Abby has an idea. She will teach Alexander how to design, and he will help her with Vanderbinks's marketing and finances. They won't tell Pieter or Laurent and keep up the combative ruse during the competition. Can they keep up the deception when the love becomes real?<br/><br/>This movie helps the audience appreciate the beauty of creating timeless jewelry. Alexander and Abby have spirited discussions about manufactured versus organic stones. Then, he shows her how to market without losing her business's soul. The love story is predictable, but the competition isn't. The scenery is gorgeous and helps you fall in love with the town. Once the event ends, you will lose interest because Hallmark movies end the same. It's a sweet but foreseeable future for Abby and Alexander.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mary J. Blige's Family Affair",
    "review": "Kendra moved to be with Ben and Ben's son, Miles, after Ben's divorce settlement forced Ben to live in North Carolina. Ben and Kendra plan to move after Miles graduates high school. While Ben praises Kendra for her efforts, Kendra feels like she's floundering, and it causes her work to suffer. She wants to connect with Miles and start a family with Ben. Ben eases her fears and proposes to his long-time love.<br/><br/>Kendra meets with her gynecologist, who delivers sad news. Kendra's miscarriage caused detrimental scarring in her uterus. Kendra has very little chance of conceiving a child. She fears Ben will cancel the wedding if she can't give him a baby.<br/><br/>Ben's boss asks Ben to be the 2nd chair on a high-profile case. They want to make Ben a partner in the law firm, and winning this case will put Ben on the fast track. Later, Ben and Kendra eat dinner with his family and discuss their wedding. Ben leaves the table and finds his brother, Calvin, drinking scotch. Ben worries because scotch could affect Calvin's medication. Calvin admits he stopped taking them. As secrets grow, Ben experiences panic attacks. However, he doesn't tell Kendra because he fears judgment. Can Ben and Kendra make it to the altar, or will their secrets kill their relationship?<br/><br/>This film carries the burden of displaying mental health in African American men but does it with care and understanding. Society assumes that privilege can hinder mental struggles. Ben and Calvin prove that to be untrue. Mary J. Blige's upbeat party anthem inspired this movie, but it has an important message about mental health among African American men. It's not as good as the last two films. But it's entertaining. This last installment needs a part four to secure a happy ending for everyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nikki's fertility clinic calls her because they need her to come to their office immediately. A former employee was on his deathbed and admitted that he made a mistake with Nikki's IVF. He implanted her and her husband's fertilized egg into another woman. The woman, Gabi, gave birth to a girl, Jenell. Gabi and her husband, Matthew, raised Jenell. The clinic informed Matthew and Jenell of their grave error, and now they want to meet Nikki.<br/><br/>Nikki sits her daughter, Erica, down and explains the situation. Nikki and Erica meet Matthew, his sister, Kelsey, and Jenell at a restaurant. Nikki lost her husband in a car accident. A burglar murdered Gabi in their garage, and the police never found the suspect. During their conversation, Jenell excuses herself from the table. In a reflection, Erica sees Jenell arguing with a guy. She leaves the table after she sees the guy, Thomas, force Jenell out the back door.<br/><br/>Erica creeps in the shadows while listening to Jenell and Thomas's conversation. He wants Jenell to rekindle their romance, but it's over for her. He reminds Jenell that he provided her alibi for her mother's murder. Jenell contests that Matthew paid Thomas handsomely for that cover story. Erica runs back to the table as Jenell storms away from Thomas.<br/><br/>Erica tells Nikki about the conversation that Erica overheard between Thomas and Jenell. Nikki thinks Erica is reaching. Erica tells her best friend, JJ, but he believes Erica misunderstood the situation. Erica uncovers Thomas's page and sends him a friend request. He accepts Erica's request and offers information for $500. Erica will reveal the truth about her sister before it destroys her mother.<br/><br/>This movie has two bratty young women uncovering the truth behind the lies. While Erica is suspicious of Jenell, everyone in Jenell's family acts shady. Before the movie ends, Gabi won't be the last victim. The plot makes you question everyone, but the IVF story is there as a misdirection more than a plot point. This film is fun to watch but requires your attention because it displays text messages on the screen without the characters reading them out loud.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
