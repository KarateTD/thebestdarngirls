    "mtitle":"Bad Romance: The Vicky White Story",
    "review":"Vicky White wakes up at 5 a.m., eats breakfast, works at the Sheriff's Office, checks on her ex-husband, Thomas, and goes home. She tried to go to a bar to pick up guys, but no one noticed her. One day, Casey White enters her jail while awaiting sentencing. The Sheriff assigns Vicky to transport Casey, and they converse on the ride. Usually, Vicky starts the dialogue, but Casey is different. He asks about her life, potential suitors, and interests. They privately corresponded in jail until the judge sentenced Casey to 75 years in the state prison. And the state moves him.<br/><br/>Vicky sends Casey mail, makes provocative phone calls, and visits when she can. But he dashes her dreams of their life together after the board rejects his appeal. Casey writes a letter to the Sheriff's office confessing to the murder of Karen Lewiston. He agrees to the confession if they send him to Vicky's jail for his sentence.<br/><br/>Vicky can barely contain her excitement when she sees Casey returning to her jail. She sees her life getting brighter, but only within the jail walls. Vicky sells her house, buys a car and guns, visits an adult shop, and puts in for retirement. She won't let the state win. She plans to break Casey out of jail and move to Mexico to start a new and exciting life with the man of her dreams. Will they make it?<br/><br/>Vicky needed a break from the monotony. Some would say that Vicky had high-functioning depression. She was a 3-time employee of the year but didn't like or value herself. She was smart enough to come up with, sad to say, a fabulous plan. However, Casey ruined it by being needy and demanding. Vicky would have gotten away with breaking Casey out if Vicky didn't have Casey weighing her down. Vicky is a sad tale of a woman who wanted more but found it in the wrong man.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After Ashley arrives in Idaho Falls, she calls her partner, Trevor. He landed a huge deal but didn't include her. Ashley grows tired of his flaky attitude and dumps Trever over the phone. Before she meets with her family, she decides to buy some items at the duty-free store. Scott lands and answers a call from his girlfriend. She doesn't think their relationship is working out. Scott believes this journeyman team is his last chance at playing in the NHL. He chooses to get food at the duty-free store.<br/><br/>Ashley quips about having a bad day, and Scott understands. They both hand their cashier the credit card, and Ashley wishes him well. Ashley does a few family errands and tries to pay with a credit card, but it doesn't go through. The cashier reads the name on the card, and it says Scott. He confiscates the card, and Ashley leaves.<br/><br/>Scott meets with his team. The coach welcomes Scott, but teammate Pierre bothers Scott about his age. Scott offers to take them to dinner and pay to connect to the players. He gives the waitress his card, and it doesn't go through. The waitress sees the name Ashley on the card and keeps it.<br/><br/>Ashley and her family attend the first hockey game and see Scott on the ice. She yells at him to meet her after the game, but he can't hear her. After finding their respective credit cards, they share a cab to go home and discover they are going to the same place. Scott is staying at Ashley's parents' backyard cottage. While she focuses on growing her business in New York with a new partner, Scott has his eyes set on the NHL. Is what they need in front of them? Only time on the ice will tell.<br/><br/>So, the credit card swap doesn't make sense. Neither notices the cards are missing, so why wouldn't it work? Maybe they didn't have the correct PIN, but you never saw them putting it into the machine. However, the family steals the show. This movie is a steady start to the 2023 season, but it doesn't grasp your attention when the leads are on the screen. Viewers will watch for Ashley's family and grandma's eggnog.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie moves into her new home after separating from her estranged husband, David. Her brother, Michael, is happy to see David go, but her best friend, Harriet, can see the longing in Maggie's face. Maggie chose to redo the kitchen and let David design it, just like their business. Now, she has to find a contractor to finish the job.<br/><br/>After several crazy contractor interviews, Maggie picks one, but he never shows up. She loses her cat and finds a man, Nate, holding it. Nate says he does kitchen remodels. He offers to look at her plans and kitchen. Maggie hires Nate and fantasizes about him. But the heavenly man of her dreams has a revenge plan from hell. And he is ready to unleash it on Maggie and Michael.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of plotholes. Somehow, Nate knows Maggie's password without any explanation. Then, he kidnaps someone, but you never see when or how. After not checking Nate's information, Maggie suddenly knows his last name. Maggie doesn't listen to the one sane person in this movie: Michael. The writer spent more time wrapping up Harriet's rescue efforts than Maggie's or Nate's sudden knowledge. Skip this movie unless you want more questions than answers.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Kristen and her best friend, Terry, spend every moment together binge-watching reality TV dating shows. Three couples are their favorite because they have a lasting love. Sienna and AJ from the Shelter of Love have an unmatched passion. Quincy and Zion, from Ex on the Mind, are on-again and off-again. Hugh and Lexy from I'd Have Your Baby will take a bullet for each other.<br/><br/>Kristen monitors the three couples' social media when she and Terry hear reports that all three couples split. Kristen wishes the couples could be on a show to rekindle their love. Terry smiles and says maybe they can. Kristen kidnaps the six people and locks them into her impenetrable villa with all the accouterments. If the couples want to survive, they must play the game and fall in love.<br/><br/>This movie is a parody of reality TV but with a murderous twist. For a while, some couples don't realize this isn't a TV show. They play to the security cameras and talk about their brands. The premise is promising, but the writing falls flat. But it's a solid commentary about reality TV and its fans. Don't be surprised if you cheer for Kristen.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Cowboy and the Movie Star",
    "review":"Actress Isabella wraps up her TV show and meets with her manager, Rose. Rose tells Isabella that she got an audition for her first lead role in a dramatic film. The film is about a woman who owns a ranch. A few days later, Isabella partially gets the role. The director wants her to spend two weeks on Dreamscape Ranch, learning how to feed animals, rope, tie knots, and clean livestock. And he wants her to get on a plane and start today. She wants to risk it all and gets on a flight.<br/><br/>Hunter runs the Dreamscape Ranch with his farm hand, Walter. Hunter's family owed this ranch for generations. A local conglomerate wants to buy Hunter's ranch, but he refuses to sell. So, when a director offered to pay him to let an actress shadow him, Hunter said yes. He suspects the actress will work for one day, take a few selfies, get tired, and leave him alone.<br/><br/>Isabella walks to the ranch with a sparkly feathered hat and heels. She gives him her list, and he laughs because that's not what cowboys do. Walter sees Hunter is putting Isabella through the wringer. Walter tells Hunter to be a Southern gentleman because Isabella is working hard. Isabella gets a call from Rose. She has one week instead of two to learn everything on her list. She pleads with Hunter to stick to it. He remembers Walter's advice and decides to guide her, but she will be his guiding light to save the ranch.<br/><br/>Hunter is the typical gruff cowboy who desires to save his family legacy. However, Isabella isn't a princess, although she looks the part. She hates bug bites but isn't afraid to get dirty. Hunter's resolve changes with Isabella's perseverance and Walter's wise words. This change in dynamic saves this movie from becoming another ordinary romantic comedy. While it follows the formula, it's entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
