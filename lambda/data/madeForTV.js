    "mtitle":"Deadly Debutante",
    "review":"Anna and Mia prepare themselves for the Debutante ball.  Anna wants to win the Belle of the Ball like her mother did years ago. Sophia heard about the ball, but she assumes it's a beauty pageant.  However, her teacher, Ms. Dennison, tells Sophia the contest is more than looks.  The Belle of the Ball gets a full scholarship to the school of her choice.  And this would be heaven-sent for Sophia. So, Sophia enters the ball and goes to the meet and greet.  Anna sees that bookworm Sophia will be stiff competition and decides to use her wealth to overcome Sophia's charms. As the competition increases, someone spray-paints Anna's garage, slashes Anna's tires, and more.  Anna knows who is trying to terrorize her: Sophia. But Sophia is aloof to Anna's fears. Determined, Anna will stop at nothing to make everyone see Sophia is a con artist.  Well, it's too bad Anna is barking up the wrong tree, and she could pay the ultimate price for it.<br/><br/>Anna has all the money in the world but no clue on how to spend it. In a world of money and beauty, Anna's family forgot to instill common sense and compassion.  In the middle of the movie, Anna calls them to task for it. Also, it doesn't take much to unpack the motive of the suspect.  This movie displays privilege at its worse, and that gives you a reason to watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Aly Raisman: From Darkness to Light",
    "review":"In the wake of Athlete A, Aly Raisman rose from shame and reclaimed herself.  While she will never speak her abuser's name, Aly wants to lend a voice to other survivors.  Especially children.  She feels that society puts too much pressure on children to speak up.  But it's adults that should be looking out for them and the signs of abuse.  As Aly travels down the road of advocacy, she needs help figuring out where she starts; and her advocacy ends. They discuss triggers, healing techniques, and acknowledging emotions.<br/><br/>Trigger warning: While this documentary can be empowering, thought-provoking, and healing for some people, it could trigger others. And the documentary crew knew this. One common theme is there is no type of survivor.  Hurt, healing, and coping skills are different based on each person and experience. As a society, we should look at drastic changes in behavior as potential signs of abuse.  And create more safes spaces and less victim-blaming.  If you need help, contact Darkness to Light or RAINN.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Secret Lives of College Freshmen",
    "review":"Hannah prepares to get out of her mother's shadow by enrolling in a different university.  Hannah wants to be a journalist like her famous mother, Nancy, but doesn't want the comparisons.  On her first day, Hannah's best friend, Jody, pulled a few strings and got them a better room together. But college and time away from home isn't the only thing that excites Hannah.  She is excited to meet her favorite writer and new professor, Andrew.  He is a great writer and very handsome. She walks into class and sees her R.A. Daisy sitting at a desk, and Hannah sits next to her.  Prof. Andrew gives a writing assignment.  They will read it in front of the class, and the writer of the best essay will be his TA. Jody wants to go to the freshmen mixer and drags Hannah there.  During the mixer, Hannah sees Andrew, and they talk.  But they are interrupted when everyone gets a disturbing video sent to their phones.  It depicts a girl getting pushed out of a window with a message stating the same.  As the police authenticate the video, Daisy tells Jody and Hannah that Amy lived in their dorm room when she killed herself, or at least they thought she did.  When they get back to the room, Hannah finds a journal that belonged to Amy. Hannah wants to find the truth but will her budding feelings for Prof. Andrew stand in the way.<br/><br/>While this movie gives you plenty of suspects, it goes for the obvious suspect in the end.  Well, at least obvious to Lifetimers.  While the plot points out Hannah's misjudgments, it is careful not to victim blame. This movie won't be a favorite, but it's a carefree watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secret Life of a Student",
    "review":"After making plans to help her friend, Chloe, set up a birthday party for Chloe's daughter, Phoebe, Lauren leaves her teaching job and heads home.  When she gets home, David, Chloe's law partner, calls.  Someone attacked Chloe in the parking lot and killed her. At the office, Phoebe runs to Lauren and hugs her.  Then, Nadia enters.  Nadia was Chloe's sister-in-law, and she came to claim Phoebe.  But David stops her. Chloe changed her will after her husband, Brad, died, making Lauren the legal guardian.  Lauren accepts and wants to start procedures immediately to begin the adoption process.  David tells Lauren she needs letters of recommendation from family, friends, and co-workers to speed up the process.  Then, Nadia and David both offer assistants if raising Phoebe becomes too hard.<br/><br/>Lauren starts to question her friends and co-workers about a letter of recommendation when she hears about a rumor about a teacher having an affair with a student. Later, someone posts a video on the school's message board.  For a while, Lauren ignores it, but the rumors come full circle when she is the one accused. Her student, Conner, expressed romantic feelings for her.  Lauren turned him down and refused to be alone with Conner again.  But he won't stop his campaign for her. If her adoption lawyer hears about the accusations and lack of employment, Lauren will lose Phoebe for good.  Lauren needs to pull her life together for Phoebe, her job, and her freedom.<br/><br/>This movie is better for shock value than plot because the title is misleading.  With the title, you would expect Conner to have a more prominent role in the film.  But he doesn't. At first, the film does have viewers questioning David's, Nadia's, and Connor's motives.  But Lifetimers can see the real evil in Lauren's life.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Influence",
    "review":"Bradley Hudson walks smoothly out of his opponents' office after securing a $500 million settlement.  As opposed to the $500,000 they proposed.  Before Bradley and his daughter, Desiree, enter the elevator to go to their office, Carla, Bradley's wife, calls Bradley with a situation she can't handle. Billy manages Grammy-award winning singer Savannah.  And she sits in Bradley's office covered in her husband's blood and tells her story. Savannah and Billy went to a club the night before to meet a movie producer.  If Savannah wants the part, she must get her husband, Kyle, to be the lead. Kyle says he won't do it and hangs up on Savannah. Savannah gets in bed next to him and wakes up covered in blood.  Savannah swears she didn't kill Kyle but knows she will be the #1 suspect. With the paparazzi, a lying client, and compulsive buying disorder hurting their case, can Hudson and Hudson win?<br/><br/>Based on Influence: Death on the Beach by Carl Weber, this movie will keep you guessing from beginning to end.  As Bradley takes two steps forward, he gets information about Savannah that pulls him one step back.  Since this movie represents the 2nd book in a series, the plot doesn't explain the character's relationships. However, this is fine because the mystery has plenty of depth to keep you wanting more.  Let's hope BET turns the first or next book into a movie.  The Hudson family has room to grow.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
