    "mtitle": "Finding Faith",
    "review": "Jaylen and Faith host a barbecue with his family and his youth basketball team. Jaylen updates his father, Henry, on his job search. He has been looking for work for a year, but hasn't found anything yet. Jaylen's mother, Helen, nitpicks at everything Faith does until the Pastor approaches the back patio. Pastor Louis greets the women and settles in for a meal. Helen continues to berate Faith when Louis walks away.<br/><br/>Jaylen takes Faith out for dinner to celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary. He surprises her by having the singer, Maria, congratulate them. They have a lovely night, and Jaylen makes breakfast for Faith in the morning. She sees an envelope under the Lazy Susan and pulls out a stack of past-due bills. She's astonished because she thought Jaylen had everything under control. He believes they would do better if she attended church more and worked less. She takes a deep breath and prepares to argue, but their son, Bryson, enters the kitchen.<br/><br/>During church, Faith gets a call from her boss, Cedric. Jaylen's upset that Faith took the call but understands they need the money. She promises to make it in time to drive to the basketball team's game. However, Cedric changes his mind about giving Faith the weekend off. Jaylen is upset that he had to drive 6 hours without help.<br/><br/>Jaylen drives as the team, including Bryson, laughs in the back. Jaylen sees a text from Faith and reads it. He takes his eyes off the road. He dodges a vehicle and flips the van several times. He runs inside and pulls everyone out. But he passes out inside the automobile, and it explodes. Jaylen dies. Faith goes into a downward spiral of addiction, custody battles, and foreclosure. She gives up on God, but he's not through with her yet.<br/><br/>This film is a welcome change from the Lifetime format. The first act will break your heart and make you beg for a commercial break. Thankfully, it comes in time. The director made spectacular choices in capturing Faith's despair. When she has to choose between work and the church, Cedric's lighting darkens behind her. He is the devil in her ear. While these elements enthrall you, it's the script that keeps you coming. The conclusion will keep you watching until the last second as Faith packs her bags for a new start. Realistic hardships, complex family dynamics, and belief fill this movie to the brim. It's a beautiful film that can fit on any platform.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secrets to Kill For",
    "review": "Shanice returns home after a run and enters a blog entry for her fans. She picks up the phone when she sees her best friend, June, on the screen. June is at the train station and wants to stay for a few days. June admits that her boyfriend's controlling attitude is getting worse. Shanice opens her doors to June for as long as June needs. Then, Shanice sees June's diary. It's helped since June uncovered that she was adopted.<br/><br/>June and Shanice spend the evening around town when June's boyfriend, Lee, screams and pulls June's arm. He wants June to return home, but Shanice pulls June away from him. Shanice finds June's bed empty in the morning. She opens the front door and is shocked to see June kissing Lee. June says Lee is a changed man.<br/><br/>Days later, Shanice gets a call from her friend, Haven. Haven hasn't seen June in days. So, Shanice returns to her parents' home. Her father, Stan, and stepmother, Pauline, can't contain their excitement. However, Shanice is there to look for June. Shanice meets with Haven for dinner. They believed Lee hurt June. Shanice returns to her parents' house and sees an envelope addressed to her in the mailbox. It contains June's diary.<br/><br/>Shanice greets an old friend, Officer Glen, and hands him June's diary. Someone found June's phone in the woods. So, the police will form a search party tomorrow. Shanice and Haven arrive at the woods, and Glen instructs the group. They start the search, and later hear Haven's screams. She found June's body with a gunshot wound to her head. Shanice vows to find evidence against Lee, but did he do it?<br/><br/>This film is an intriguing mystery because the clues point to Lee, Stan, Pauline, Glen, and Haven. The movie has a dark overcast to alert the viewer that something ominous lurks in the shadows. The sound production is top-notch for a Lifetime film, and the director used practical lighting. Also, the motive is pearl clutching. However, the acting is a bit overdone. It makes devastating and frightening moments laughable. This mystery entertains, and the film deserves your attention.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Death at the Diner",
    "review": "Aurora tries her boyfriend's new menu item and loves it. Aurora's boss, Emilio, also loves Daniel's cooking. Emilio's wife, Kathleen, enters the kitchen with tough news. The tax rate for diners is going up. Emilio knows this will affect his diner's bottom line, and he must inform his investor, Ben.<br/><br/>While Aurora's in school, Emilio's ex-wife, Lauren, and their son, Steven, stop by the diner. She is furious because Emilio didn't return Steven's calls. Lauren huffs as Steven removes her from the restaurant. Later, Aurora calls Daniel. She will return to the restaurant because she left her phone there. She asks Daniel to pick her up at the diner.<br/><br/>Aurora enters the diner and steps on black beads. She gasps at Emilio's corpse with a knife in the back. Daniel checks Emilio's pulse, confirms Emilio's death, and contacts the police. Detective Alistair and Officer Arthur survey the scene. They consider Daniel the primary suspect. Aurora protests that Daniel couldn't be the killer. However, fingerprints, cash, and hair prove her wrong. Can she discover Emilio's murderer or accept that Daniel has a dark side?<br/><br/>Based on characters created by Charlaine Harris, this film is something Sleuthers can sink their teeth into and enjoy. Emilio was a complicated man who cared deeply for Aurora and Daniel. However, the writers ensured that everyone in his orbit had shady pasts and sneaky dealings. The writers added witty banter between Detective Alistair and D.A. Morris. The script hits a nerve with Arthur's feelings toward Aurora. This plot gives us a glimpse into Aurora's future with her true love. This installment is funny and mysterious. Hallmarkies will love it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sins of the Father",
    "review": "Organist Mary arrives at the pulpit late because she was crying. After service, Mary stays behind to clean up the pews. She cuts her finger and leaves her phone behind to tend to her wound. Then, two arguing people enter the church. Mary hides and eavesdrops on their conversation. The man, Troy, forces a young teen, Brianna, to sit. Mary slips out but hears Brianna fighting Troy. Mary opens her trunk and grabs a tire iron. She sneaks up behind Troy and swings. However, he catches her and pulls it away.<br/><br/>Troy ties Brianna and Mary to the pew, and Mary sees that Troy is bleeding. Brianna whispers that Troy is her dad. He was in prison for her entire life and recently got out. She is afraid to stay with him, but fearful of what he will do if she tries to escape. Mary vows to remain by Brianna's side and help her flee the clutches of a madman.<br/><br/>This movie has close calls, a high hit count, and quick-thinking ingenuity. Brianna is a smart-mouthed teen in desperate need of help. The plot has the fear and antics viewers expect from a Lifetime film. However, it offers a dose of hidden religion. Viewers expect a pure thriller and get an unwanted inspirational lecture. The film's saving grace is that it doesn't end where you'd expect. It feels like a two-part film wrapped into one. If you can handle a dose of faith, then remain for the father's sin.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Providence Falls: Chance of a Lifetime",
    "review": "Detective Cora receives a phone call from her boss. There was another break-in at a jewelry store. They believe it could link to a string of home burglaries in the area. Cora stops at the coffee shop owned by her friend, Suzette. Suzette moves Cora to the front of the line when D.A. Finn enters. He heard about the break-in and is prepared to help. Suzette sees the sparks between them and suggests Cora give Finn a chance. Cora says no because of workplace optics.<br/><br/>Liam drops from the sky and onto a chair. Agon and his case worker, Samael, greet him. Liam was in limbo for 200 years because he altered Cora's fate. In Ireland years ago, Liam was a thief, and Cora's family came from great wealth. Cora was supposed to marry Finn. That changed the day Liam broke into her home to steal her diamond pendant. During their escape, Cora tripped, fell from a great height, and died. Cora and Finn, along with five other souls, were reincarnated to finish their life's mission. This time, they want Liam to return and play matchmaker for Finn and Cora. If he completes the mission, Liam will go to heaven. Otherwise, he will go to hell. Liam agrees to return, but Agon, his guide, will check on him if needed.<br/><br/>Liam drops into Providence Falls, and Chief Boyd recognizes Liam as a friend from out of town. He updates Liam on the case as Liam sees the badge around his neck. Liam sees Cora, and his feelings return. He wants to rekindle his romance. However, Samael added a safeguard. Every time Cora touches him, he feels pain. Agon reminds Liam of what's at stake. Can Liam save his soul when mistakes of the past repeat themselves?<br/><br/>Based on 'Chance of a Lifetime' by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets, this timebending mystery is a three-part epic love story that spans 200 years. The edits between now and then are some of the smoothest in Hallmark history. The comic relief of Agon will make you laugh out loud, while his compassion will touch your heart. This film will make you want to read the source material. It's a magnificent start to a series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
