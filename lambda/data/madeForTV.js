    "review":"Tiffanie and Damon are days away from their lavish wedding. Before Damon, Tiffanie was a virgin and dreams of the passion she read about in romance novels.  However, those days are over for Damon.  He wants a loving and proper wife, not the many women he had in the past.  As Damon's business skyrockets, he assists Tiffanie with her new spa, but he is not as silent of a partner as promised. As Tiffanie eats yogurt, a knock at the door jolts her and makes her drop a glass on the ground. Tiffanie goes to the door and sees Trey. Trey and Damon were old friends, and Trey recently got out of jail.  Tiffanie forgot to pick him up.  Instead of being angry, Trey wipes yogurt off her lips and licks it off his finger.  This act sends a shiver up Tiffanie's spine.  Soon, she is fantasizing about Trey and forgetting her responsibilities. If Tiffanie isn't careful, lust will be her ultimate downfall.<br/><br/>Based on Lust: A Seven Deadly Sins Novel by Victoria Christopher Murray, this movie gives the viewer a lot to ponder.  Trey and Damon talk about an incident in the past that caused Trey's arrest.  But you don't know what happened until the last 30 minutes.  And the passion between Trey and Tiffanie oozes off the screen. But the writer ensures the viewer understands her frustration because Damon micromanages her career and offers lackluster romance.  This movie is a commanding start to the book series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rev. Benjamin's church, Monroe Baptist Church, needs a lot of work and a new van, but the church has a windfall coming.  Under Baxter's advice, Benjamin invested the church's money in cryptocurrency, and it's up 200%. After his weekly Lean On Me meeting, Benjamin meets with Baxter to cash out.  But Baxter tells him the money is gone.  Benjamin explains that he borrowed $50,000 against the church to invest.  If he doesn't pay the bank back, he will lose his church.  In the morning, a sullen Benjamin explains what happened to his wife, Vanessa.  Vanessa grabs her coat and Benjamin and heads to Baxter's office, Whitcomb Trust Financial.  As they argue with the security officer to let them in, Baxter drives up to the office in his brand new car, suit, and gold tooth. Benjamin knows it was all a scam.  Benjamin and Vanessa call the authorities, and FBI agent Sherry comes to their home.  Sherry tells the couple that Baxter has been on their radar for months, but they can't find concrete evidence of his scam. But without evidence, there is little she can do to help get the money back.  During the next service, Benjamin stands in front of the congregation and reveals the truth.  Then, he meets with his support group and gets an idea from a group member, Jack.  Jack is an ex-convict who mentions robbing Baxter in jest.  After the meeting, Benjamin approaches Jack about a robbery, but Jack says no.  Hours later, Jack sees all the good the church did for the community, and he agrees to help Benjamin.  Jack and Benjamin stake out Baxter's office and cause a diversion to case it.  Jack scopes out the security system, the layout, and a safe.  With their intel, Jack comes up with a plan. They need a Distractor, Tech Support, Getaway Driver, Greaseman, and a Utility Guy.  Benjamin knows where he can fill each of those positions: The Lean on Me group. Now, the team has to get their money back and keep Jack out of jail.<br/><br/>This movie is funny, captivating, and thought-provoking. It mixes American Greed, Saints and Sinners, and Leverage, and you will love it.  For this church, you want to see it all come together.  Of course, with every heist, something doesn't go according to plan.  Their solution involves soap, double dutch, and a switch.  While the graphics aren't the best, the plot more than makes up for it.  Save this one on your DVR.  You will want to watch it again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vice Principal Monica watches her students like her kids, Leah and CJ.  Monica's boyfriend, Theo, wants to get a home together, but Monica admits to her friend, Connie, that she doesn't want to lose the house she and Charles bought together.  After losing Charles in a routine traffic stop five years ago, Monica reached acceptance and opened her home to foster children.  In the middle of the night, Monica gets a knock at the door.  Social worker Stephanie stands on Monica's doorstep with siblings Rachel and Peter. They didn't want to go back or go to a group home, so Stephanie asks Monica if they can stay with her until she finds a better fit.  Without hesitation, Monica opens her door for them.  They stayed at Monica's home several times, but this time something feels different.  Monica wants to adopt Rachel and Peter, and she tells her family. Theo, who grew up in foster care, tells Monica that a black woman adopting white children will cause problems. But as Monica goes through the adoption process, she will learn that several people share Theo's reservations, and those feelings start to affect the kids.  When narrow-minded thinking stands in Monica's way, she will use her voice to show the world the color of love.<br/><br/>This movie talks about racial issues without politics.  And both sides of the spectrum, black and white, have a problem with Monica adopting the children. The script is careful not to place the concerns on one group of people.  Adoption should be about love and stability, never about race or politics.  Let's not forget, this movie sheds light on the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After their father, James, left to fight in the Vietnam war, Juliet and Evangeline fight like cats and dogs, much to the chagrin of their mother, Marguerite.  One day, Marguerite calls an old friend.  She is sick of the small-town life and wants to move back to New York to sing, but she doesn't want to bring her girls.  So, Marguerite drops the girls off at James' parents' home and drives away. Thirty years later, Juliet is a disc jockey on Fireside radio and calls out to Evangeline over their airwaves.  Walt is sick, and she wants Evangeline to see their grandfather before he passes away. With an open microphone, Juliet will open up about their family, secrets, and toilet paper.<br/><br/>Based on When Last We Spoke by Marci Henna, you don't understand the full scope of the plot until the last 30 minutes.  And if it doesn't feel like the story is complete, that's because it's not.  There is a second novel for the Cranbourne family with so many more stories to tell.  While it's a sweet story with emotion, everything is predictable, except the Elvis car.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ben and Cara have successful careers but have yet to get married. So Ben gets a crazy idea to get married today. But Cara can't do it because her father, Ray, is not there.  Ben understands and says he will wait as long as she wants.  Later that night, Cara gets an idea and calls the Clara Lake Resort, the place she met Ben, and tries to book their cabin.  However, the concierge tells Cara someone booked it for a wedding as a surprise.  The renter owns a snowboard company, and his fiancé is a writer.  Cara knows the concierge is talking about her and Ben.  Ben tried to keep it a secret, but now it's out.  In ten days, Ben and Cara will marry at the same resort they met, and Cara knows who can put it all together, Megan.  Megan will have double duty as the maid of honor and wedding planner, but she has a glue gun for any tasks. However, Megan doesn't have Sean because he is working overseas and can't come. She wants to travel the world but needs to know their relationship is going in the same direction.  Cara understands how Megan feels because Ben keeps secrets from her, and Cara feels he has more.  She is right.  Ben knows that Sean is preparing to propose to Megan. Ben's sneaky behavior catches Cara's attention, but she focuses on her next novel and the mystery of Clara Lake Resort's founding couple.  With so much going on, will Cara and Ben make it down the aisle? Well, let's ask the snowstorm, the dress, and the missing cake.<br/><br/>Following One Winter Proposal, this movie is the best of the trilogy.  It offered two relationships in different stages, but both with issues, a love mystery, a buyout, and secrets galore.  This movie has so many moving parts, it's hard to imagine how the plot will come together.  But the writers pulled the conclusion together effortlessly. And it makes you look forward to Megan and Ben's wedding.  Let's cross our fingers that the writers will give their wedding the same treatment as Ben and Cara's.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
