    "review":"Four weeks ago, a man in a fake rideshare car tried to kidnap Kimber after a party. Kimber's mom, Principal Shawna, wants to keep Kimber under lock and key. Lately, Kimber acts out in class and cheats. Her teacher sends Kimber to Shawna's office. Kimber leaves in a huff and joins her friend, Everleigh.<br/><br/>After classes, Kimber finds a prom-posal on her locker from her boyfriend, Austin. Kimber excepts Austin's invitation. Everleigh and Kimber walk down the school steps as Joan approaches. Joan tells Kimber that she misses their friendship and would like to spend more time together like they did when they were best friends. Kimber asks Joan to be her plus 2 for prom, much to Everleigh's chagrin.<br/><br/>Austin gets a limo for himself, Kimber, Joan, Everleigh, and Everleigh's boyfriend, Luke. The driver tells them they can't drink, rough house, or put their limbs outside the limo. And Shawna tells them no alcohol. They agree to the driver and Shawna's conditions. Austin snuck alcohol on board, much to Kimber's surprise. Everyone but Joan does shots as the driver takes them to Austin's next surprise. He decided to take Kimber and the group to the place he and Kimber had their first date. As they laugh, the driver makes a video of them drinking. He threatens to take them home if they don't abstain from alcohol for the remainder of the night and relinquish their phones. The driver puts their phone under the front wheel, gets in the limo, and drives over them. It doesn't take long for the group to realize they are going in the wrong direction. The driver locks the doors, rolls up the windows, and tells them to do what he says or die.<br/><br/>Wow, there are so many mistakes it's difficult for viewers to feel bad for them. And their mistakes cost one member of the group their life. There are hints of the motive sprinkled throughout the plot. And the perpetrator's monologue will tie it all together. When the dust settles, one person will be the undeniable villain of this story, and it's not the kidnapper.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
