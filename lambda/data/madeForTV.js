During a rehearsal, Amy is interrupted by Mitchell, the CEO of McHale Tech.  Amy saw Mitchell's wife, Alexis, and Mitchell's best friend, Billy, very close at dinner last night.  When Mitchell falls off the roof and dies, Amy believes Billy or Alexis is the killer.  On the other hand, Travis thinks its Tim.

Catherine was told about an Executive Success Program by a friend.  She believes it will help her and India grow in business and get out of their slump.  Plus, they can do it together.  After the first seminar, Catherine and India sign up for more in Albany.  Catherine witnesses some disturbing trends in the house and wants to leave, But India wants to stay.

        "review":"Amy attends her father's book festival to get her mind off her recent office break-in.  Later that night, she is doing great until Travis spots a man sitting outside Graham's house.  Travis checks the man out and discovers the man is dead.  Shaken but not deterred, Graham continues with the festival.  But Graham will end the night in handcuffs when he is suspected of killing Betsy.  At one time, Betsy had the number one author because she stole Graham's first manuscript and gave it to another author.  The author is no longer successful but Graham still holds resentment.  If Amy and Travis don't help him, he could be serving a life sentence.<br/><br/>While there are plenty of good suspects and a strong plotline, the killer is an easy choice for long-time Hallmark fans.  So watch this movie for how the killer committed the crime, not the killer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
