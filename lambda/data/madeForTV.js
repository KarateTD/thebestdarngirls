    "review":"Patricia enjoys the 10th birthday party she prepared for her daughter, Cameron. Then, Patricia gets a phone call from her sister, Mia, while talking to her family. Mia has gifts for Cameron and is bringing them to Patricia's home. Patricia doesn't like having Mia around because Mia killed a man, but Reneé justifies the murder by saying it was in self-defense. Patricia goes outside to meet Mia. Patricia tells Mia to take her presents and leave.<br/><br/>Patricia prepares oatmeal for Cameron's breakfast and passes out while bleeding from her ear. Patricia suffered a brain aneurysm, and Reneé calls Mia to care for Cameron. Patricia wakes up in pain with Mia by her bedside three weeks later. She brings Cameron to the room and offers to look after Cameron until Patricia is ready and healthy. After Patricia says yes, Mia calls the social worker, Josh, to bring the paperwork. He sees his co-worker, Gail, walking by and asks for her help. Josh promises these are his most effortless and vetted files. She agrees to take over since he did the leg work.<br/><br/>Cameron comes home with Mia and meets Mia's boyfriend, Chris, and their maid, Nancy. Mia and Chris give Cameron a doll and tell her to go to her room in the basement. Cameron opens the door but hesitates when she sees it's dark and smells bad. Chris picks her up, pushes her in, and locks the door. Then Nancy introduces Cameron to the others, Joanne and Harland. Cameron asks Nancy how long she will be in the basement. Nancy says that only Mia knows. Cameron will need to pray her way out of hell.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie will make your stomach turn while covering many systemic issues. First, Patricia doesn't want to see a doctor after several migraines because urgent care is expensive. Next is the underfunded, understaffed, and overworked social workers. Also, the movie tackles abusing benefits. Mia keeps these people for their welfare or disability checks. And last but certainly not least, the abuse. Mia uses physical, mental, and sexual abuse to keep her slaves in line and doesn't hesitate to burn, pimp, beat, or kill anyone who attempts to speak up. The actors are tremendous, the sets are frightening, and the storyline is enthralling. This film isn't only for watching, but it is a call to action.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie takes a calming breath and walks to the ocean with her surfboard. Maggie falls into the water holding on to her knee. A lifeguard, Blake, grasps Maggie and pulls her out of the water. As Blake attends to Maggie, Maggie's boyfriend, Cade, runs to her with concern and panic in his voice. Cade is angry that Maggie went surfing because the doctor didn't medically clear her. Then, Maggie notices Cade's co-worker, Tina, flirting with Cade and believes Cade had an affair with Tina. Maggie leaves Cade alone and thanks Blake again.<br/><br/>Blake comes to Maggie's job and gives her a knee massager. Blake talks about his life in Florida, and Maggie mentions her artwork. Maggie took her art to the Seaside Gallery, but the owner, Sam, didn't like it. Maggie plans on showing Sam a new piece in her collection tomorrow.<br/><br/>Blake accompanies Maggie to the gallery for support, and they find devastation. Someone broke into the gallery and destroyed all the artwork. Sam looks at Maggie's painting and says it's not good enough. Blake steps in and defends Maggie's art. With a convincing argument, Blake changes Sam's mind. Sam will display Maggie's artwork if Maggie and Blake get the gallery ready in time.<br/><br/>Maggie runs to her boss, AJ, for time off, and he grants it. AJ is proud of Maggie, but he worries that Blake is dangerous. Maggie tells AJ that he is wrong about Blake. Blake has only been supportive, kind, and fun. He listens to her and helps make her dreams come true. AJ relents and gives Maggie the day off for her show. Maggie is on cloud nine but has no idea how unhinged Blake is now and in his past. Unbeknownst to Maggie, Blake stalked her on the beach for months and took her near drowning as a sign to save her from life, even if he must kill her to do it.<br/><br/>Maggie is anything but a victim. She calls out Cade for cheating, Blake for fighting, and Tina for lying. No one gets a pass from Maggie. She refuses to lie down and take anything from anyone, and it's refreshing to see. Now don't let the graphics and poor green screen throw you off. This movie has an excellent plot with a strong heroine and leaves the door open for part two. So sit back and watch with your popcorn and wine.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ellie plans her 15-year high school reunion with her friend, Jasmine, at the local cafe. Lately, Ellie's daughter, Brooklyn, has withdrawn from Ellie. Ellie and Jasmine continue to converse when Averie walks to their table. Ellie and Averie competed for the same parts in plays during high school. Their teacher, Ms. Meadows, always picked Ellie. Averie retreats after making Ellie feel insignificant. Then Tiffany walks over to their table and sits down. Ellie's phone rings and she excuses herself. Brooklyn's principal, Principal Trammel, wants Ellie to come to the school immediately.<br/><br/>Ellie arrives at Liberty High School and finds her husband, Daniel, by the lockers. Principal Trammel tells them that Brooklyn and her friend, Sadie, found Ms. Meadow's body in the theater. Principal Trammel informs Ellie that Brooklyn chose to speak to the school counselor and convinced Sadie to go too. Brooklyn wanders to Principal Trammel's office with the counselor, Indigo. But Indigo retreats when she sees Ellie in the hallway.<br/><br/>After dinner, Ellie sits on the back porch with Jasmine and admits she got pregnant with Brooklyn senior year. Ellie confesses Ms. Meadows convinced her to keep her baby. Jasmine leaves, and Ellie knocks on Brooklyn's door to check on Brooklyn. But Brooklyn doesn't answer. David forces her door open and finds the window open with Brooklyn's phone on the bed. Ellie calls Sadie, who brings Ellie home. Brooklyn calls Ellie a hypocrite because she overheard the conversation between Ellie and Jasmine. Ellie assures Brooklyn that she doesn't regret having Brooklyn. Ellie goes to her bathroom to take a bath and finds a horror scene in the mirror. Someone cracked the glass and wrote Blood Will Have Blood. And Daniel calls the police.<br/><br/>Ellie tries to convince Trevor that her attacker is Ms. Meadows's killer. Trevor informs Ellie that the investigation is over, and they consider Ms. Meadows's death an accident. So, Ellie will continue to plan the reunion and focus on her friends and family. But someone has Ellie in their crosshairs. Ellie must unpack 15 years of lies to discover who wants to kill her and why.<br/><br/>Let's be honest. This movie is about immature women dwelling in high school drama because they don't know how to converse with each other. They could have solved half of their problems with a simple discussion. This movie is a bunch of small mysteries wrapped in an enigma. However, it doesn't captivate you because all the characters are unlikeable. Nevertheless, the acting is superb, and it will keep you occupied for 2 hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jane walks into her boss's office and gets laid off to make the company look lean to receive a better price in their merger. Jane leaves and calls her boyfriend, Aiden, to say she will be home early. He didn't get her call because Jane caught him in bed with another woman. She calls her friend, Cassie, to relay the day's events. Cassie consoles her friend, but it's not enough. Jane's grown tired of the city, the grind, and the men. She wants to move and start a new life.<br/><br/>Jane sees her landlord, Mr. Rodriguez, in the hallway and tells him she is leaving. Mr. Rodriguez tells her she has to give 30 days' notice. But since she is a good tenant and it's the 15th, he will let her move on the 30th without penalty. She goes to her favorite coffee shop, but it's closed for renovations. So Jane walks into Something's Brewing a few blocks away. She places her continuous order with David, and he brings it to her. David sits, and they chat. Jane tells him she lost her job but not her plans to move. David takes a leap of faith and asks Jane out. She agrees with a smile.<br/><br/>Jane and Cassie meet, Jane informs Cassie that a few headhunters contacted her with offers. Then Jane tells Cassie about her non-date date with David, but Jane thinks he is secretive. However, Jane refuses to dwell on it because she won't be in town much longer.<br/><br/>Jane meets with Ms. Ellen Rogers, and Ellen knows Jane is a dedicated worker. Ellen conveys to Jane that the job can't be remote, and Jane leaves. Jane gets a call from David, and he wants to have dinner. Jane has a great time but wants to know what David hides from her. So Jane follows him to a girls' softball game and uncovers David's daughter, Mandy. She believes this is one of David's secrets. Can their relationship grow with all the secrets and Jane's moving date?<br/><br/>This movie starts with the typical life-falling-apart-and-move-to-the-small-city plot. But the 15-day window gives Jane time to reassess her decision, find a new career, and discover unsuspecting love in a city she wants to leave in her rearview. Jane's expectation of David over those 15 days is unrealistic. It's too much, too fast. The plot is different, and the movie is entertaining. It won't be your favorite, but it's worth your time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
