    "review":"Before Abby meets with her potential client, Antonio, she gets a phone call from her sister, Claire. Claire's grandfather-in-law, Frank, passed away. Frank left his home to Claire's husband, John, and Claire wants Abby to flip the house to sell it. Abby says she will try and hangs up the phone.<br/><br/>Antonio wants to gentrify a downtown area. He knows there will be resistance, but Abby is on board and willing to work on the holidays. Antonio respects Abby's drive and makes her the real estate agent. Abby joyfully jumps with her assistant, Jessica, and leaves to see Claire.<br/><br/>Abby, Claire, and John arrive at Frank's home, and Abby sees John and Claire whispering when Bo approaches. Claire admits that John is a co-beneficiary of the home with Bo, Frank's handyman. Bo wants to turn the home into a B and B, not flip it. Bo and Abby immediately disagree.<br/><br/>As Bo and Abby work together, Abby learns more about the small town and grows to love its charm. Abby and Bo leave a caf√©, and she spots a 90-acre lot for sale. Abby calls Jessica to get a progress report on their deal with Antonio. Then, Abby mentions the lot. Jessica takes the initiative and tells Antonio about the space. He decides he wants to build on it and gentrify the small town. Can she fix it before everything falls apart?<br/><br/>This movie wraps its few poignant moments in long lulls. The plot follows the story of an uptight, overworked city woman falling for the laid-back small-town guy. This movie offers carefree laughs and advice. Everything else is predictable. This film will not be a favorite of the season, but it rounds out the holiday movie lineup.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Zara speculates something is bothering her daughter, Rose, and questions Rose about it. Rose tells her mother that her biology class is learning about genetics. And it made Rose think about her birth parents. Zara avoids the topic by taking Rose out of school and to a fair with Rose's father, Max. Rose's friend, Chloe, tells Rose to bring up the topic again. Then, they noticed the new guidance counselor, Ms. Haley Addams. Haley will meet with all the students to get to know them.<br/><br/>Rose sits with Haley and reports that school and her friendships are fine. However, she visibly becomes uncomfortable talking about her home life. Rose leaves, but Haley invites Rose for another office visit. Rose likes Haley, and they hang out after school. When Rose returns home late, Zara meets them at the front door in a rage. Haley tells Zara that she is Rose's biological mother. Zara wants to find Rose's adoption records and get a DNA test. Until then, Zara wants Rose to stay away from Haley. Zara investigates Haley and learns she is a con woman. However, the test results prove Haley is Rose's mother. She worries that Haley faked the test and will keep digging. Zara has no idea the truth she will unearth.<br/><br/>This film solves a common LMN problem by requesting a DNA test early. Nevertheless, Zara waits too long to report Haley to Rose's school. This delay allowed Haley 8 hours of uninterrupted access to Rose to corrupt her mind against her parents. The writers focus on Haley, but Haley is not the family's biggest evil. The plot takes the viewer down a path of predictability to trick you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Peyton trains guide dogs for people with visibility issues. While she trains Max, Peyton sees a man, Trevor, pick up his daughter, Annie, from school. She watches him put away his collapsible cane and place his hand on Annie's shoulder. Later, Peyton leaves a flyer at the school for Annie.<br/><br/>Professor Trevor walks to the university to teach classic literature after dropping Annie off at school. He bumps his head on construction and demands to speak to the owner. He apologizes and leads Trevor to the closest staircase but explains the repairs will take time and change often around the building. After work, Trevor returns home. Annie sees the bump on his head, and he explains what happened. Annie wakes up and tricks Trevor into going to Peyton's business.<br/><br/>Peyton thinks a dog will help Trevor tremendously and sits with Annie and Trevor to learn more about his vision, his needs, and Annie. Trevor rapidly lost his sight two years ago. Trevor thinks his cane works fine, but Peyton says a dog can help Trevor avoid obstacles before his cane can detect them. She decides that Max is the best fit for Trevor and makes appointments to prepare Trevor to work with Max. Peyton will help Trevor see the world, but he will make her see herself.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Peyton and her boyfriend, Chad, who quickly becomes a non-factor. Also, your blood will boil after Annie defends herself in school and the principal threatens her with suspension. It's beautiful to see how Trevor and Peyton make each other stronger. This film follows the rom-com script but has a heartfelt lesson for the audience.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma and her assistant tirelessly worked to create a company retreat for the partners at the law firm. Emma's boss, Ms. Hollings, hints that Emma will get her coveted promotion to partner if the trip goes well. Emma sent a box of necessities and conference room specifications to the Sunset Lodge. She plans to get there early to set up and ensure everything is perfect.<br/><br/>Liam chops wood as Mr. Powers approaches. For months, Mr. Powers tried to entice Liam to sell the lodge, but Liam refused. Today is no different. Liam gathers his team to double-check the menu and activities for the upcoming corporate retreat. If this event goes well, they can open the lodge to a new market. But if it goes poorly, Liam will have to sell.<br/><br/>Liam drives to the local bus stop to pick up Emma, and she is unhappy with the golf cart ride on a bumpy road. She wants her box, and Liam ignores her inquiries because he can't find it. She realizes Liam is the owner, and he promises to find her missing box. Liam takes Emma to her cabin and warns her the meteorologist predicts 10 inches of rain. So, the roads will close.<br/><br/>Emma calls Ms. Hollings in the morning to update her on the retreat. However, Ms. Hollings heard about the rain and canceled it. But she tells Emma not to leave. Ms. Hollings tells Emma that her cousin, Mr. Powers, has tried to buy that property for months. She wants Emma to stay and convince the owner to sell it. If she does, the promotion is a guarantee. Emma will slip into Liam's mind and try to change it, but will he do the same to her heart?<br/><br/>Emma takes planning to a scary level. When she tries to fix the rain, it's one step too far. This movie does have a romance subplot between lodge employees, but it's not necessary. However, the box comes full circle. This film is a solid way to spend two hours, but it won't be a favorite.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
