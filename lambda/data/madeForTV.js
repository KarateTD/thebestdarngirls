    "mtitle":"Mom's Christmas Boyfriend",
    "review":"Emma and her daughter, Lily, plan the seating arrangements for Emma's Christmas Eve dinner. Lily points out that everyone has a date but Emma. Emma and Lily go to the mall to buy donations for a needy family. A mall elf tells Lily about a Children's Christmas Wish contest. Kids write their wish, and the winner gets their wish granted and money for a charity of their choice. Lily throws caution to the win and writes a wish.<br/><br/>Zach retrieves the wish box from the mall elf and walks to his office but bumps into Emma along the way. They share a laugh, apologize, and retreat. Zach's co-worker, Brady, stresses over the new and predictable wishes because they haven't finished the last box. Their boss, Veronica, puts their jobs on the line. Zach stops at Lily's illustrated card as they read through the wishes. She wants her mom to have a boyfriend for the holiday and her charity family to receive the donation. Zach and Brady pick Lily as their winner.<br/><br/>Zach and Brady call Emma and Lily to announce Lily as the winner and get Emma's permission to film them. However, they leave out Lily's wish. They come to Emma's home with a camera crew and a reporter. The reporter asks Lily about her wish, and she tells the truth while Emma sits stunned. At the end of the interview, the reporter lets viewers know that they can email Emma directly through a link on the store's website. Emma selects the ruggedly handsome Clark. As Emma spends time with Clark, Zach follows for content and starts to fall for Emma. Will he reveal the truth or keep quiet for the wish promotion?<br/><br/>Thank goodness we have a child acting their age in a holiday movie. Lily is funny and sassy, thanks to her Aunt Britt. When viewers meet Clark, they will know he wants to be insta-famous. It's a stark contrast to Emma and her reserved nature. Also, the script lets viewers see the unbreakable bond between Lily and Emma. Lily is the shimmering glue that holds this predictable film together.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Smart Home Killer",
    "review":"After surviving a home invasion, Leia signed up for a beta community of smart homes. The company, Soteria, created an automated home with glowing devices in every room. Leia loves the heightened security, but her teenage daughter, Harper, thinks it's creepy. Soteria's CEO, Devin, introduces Leia to the system and shows her what it can do, but he can't finish because he has another meeting. Devin asks his associate, Wesley, to come over later to finish the demo.<br/><br/>Wesley shows Leia and Harper the rest of the system while Harper and Wesley exchange flirty quips. They walk outside, and Wesley asks for Harper's phone. They exchange phone numbers and plan to meet later.<br/><br/>Devin talks to her handsome friend, Oscar, at work when she gets an alert for Harper's school. Harper missed her after-lunch classes. She checks the pool's camera and sees Harper and her friend, Nikko, in the pool with Wesley. Leia runs home, kicks Wesley out, scolds Harper, and reports Wesley to Devin. Leia hopes Devin will keep Wesley under control so she can focus on her new job and smart home. Who is in control when the smart home turns evil?<br/><br/>This movie feels predictable, with a creepy man targeting a teenage girl. But the script never explains why Wesley stalks the family in the beginning. The film's saving grace is one shocking moment that changes the plot from expected to wild. If you need to kill two hours while not paying attention, this movie is what you should watch.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Miracle of Bethlehem, PA",
    "review":"After years of waiting and praying, Mary Ann got the call. Her adoption went through, and now she needs to drive to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and get her baby girl, Natalie. She quickly packs her baby items and drives to Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Brooke grows tired of Joe's lazy attitude. He runs his father's auto repair shop. But Joe lost his passion for his band and home maintenance after his father died. She is done with him. As Brooke walks out the door, Joe's sister, Frankie, enters with Joe's nephew. She knows Joe isn't the most responsible man. However, he cares about his nephew. Frankie will work overtime tonight taking care of the inn.<br/><br/>After Mary Ann gets Natalie, she drives home, but a blizzard forces her to pull over. She stops at Bethlehem Star Inn for a room. Frankie tells Mary Ann that there are no vacancies at the inn, but recalls Joe has a spare bedroom and offers it to Mary Ann. Frankie warns Mary Ann that Joe's place is a barn, but it's a comfortable place for Mary Ann and Natalie. Joe reluctantly lets Mary and Natalie stay at his home for one night. But Mary Ann and Joe will change the course of their lives forever.<br/><br/>This movie, loosely based on the birth of Jesus, has the faith viewers miss during the holidays. However, it's not direct. It hints at the biblical references and leaves it for viewers to discover. With the community's help, Joe and Mary Ann fall in love, and it's beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Nate meets with Beth, and she asks for his paperwork. However, Nate doesn't want to work with Beth because she won't connect to the theater.<br/><br/>Beth discusses Nate with her sister, Kat. Kat begs Beth to continue helping Nate because that theater has been a godsend for Riley. Later, she dresses as a ghost and performs a skit for Nate. Nate agrees to have her assistance.

Will 624 be a guiding light for Kate, or will Nate's inability to take ownership of his financial problems destroy their destiny?<br/><br/>Viewers must be attentive to the opening scene because it involves the numbers in Kate's morning activities. After she gets her angel number, it's everywhere. At first, Kate wants to ignore it. But it's impossible. This movie is mildly entertaining and lives up to its title. It will entertain for two hours. But it will get lost in the mountain of holiday films.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amelia sits with her father, John, and converses about their clients. John abruptly stops and confesses that he worries about Amelia. Since Amelia and her ex-girlfriend, Margot, broke up, Amelia keeps to herself. John thinks Amelia needs to interact and make friends because it will help when she becomes his law partner. And he knows the perfect person, Dani. Then, he gives Amelia two invitations to the required company Christmas Eve party.<br/><br/>Dani calls her parents, Luke and Raquel, with sad news. She can't visit them for the holidays because she is working on her photography portfolio. Also, Dani is coordinating a silent Christmas auction for the Brooklyn Artists Lab and will display her artwork at the event. Then, Luke tells Dani that his friend's daughter is new to the city and needs a companion. He thinks she and Dani will get along. Dani agrees to meet with Amelia.<br/><br/>Before Dani meets with Amelia, she gets a surprise. Her parents arrive in New York City to see her. Dani meets with Amelia at a café and shares a laugh. However, they don't believe they will see each other again. Amelia returns home, and John calls for an update. She tells John that the date went well and that she and Dani are dating. Amelia reaches into her pockets and pulls out two pairs of gloves. Amelia texts Dani and plans to meet to return the gloves.<br/><br/>Dani and Amelia meet at the café again and joke about the gloves. Then, Raquel and Luke enter with smiles. Amelia excuses herself and asks Dani to follow her outside. She admits to telling her father they were dating and assumes her dad called Dani's dad about the 'good news.' Dani laughs at the predicament and comes up with a plan. They can 'fake date' until Christmas Eve. Dani says yes. What will happen when faking it becomes too real?<br/><br/>For Amelia and Dani, this isn't a coming-out story. Their parents know and accept their daughters and want the best for them. And they aren't the only LGBTQIA+ characters. They have a supporting community of friends and family. The script is funny and allows them to fall in love without forcing it. Although their parents set them up, their relationship is part of their destiny. This film is sweet and easy to watch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
