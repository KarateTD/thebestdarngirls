    "mtitle":"Gone Mom: The Disappearance of Jennifer Dulos",
    "review":"In 1999, Jennifer told her friend, Aubrey, that she is leaving New York City for Colorado's quiet life.  Jennifer hopes the mountain air and quiet will allow her to write her novel. That's when she meets Fotis, a fellow Brown University graduate. After a passionate night together, they part ways and won't see each other for years.  In 2003, Jennifer, tired of the Colorado air, moves back to New York, and Fotis calls after seeing her picture on the society page for a charity event.  They start to date and get married in less than a year. Five kids later, the cracks in their marriage are visible to friends and Jennifer's readers online.  Fotis's business trips take more time away from his family and mask his affairs.  When Jennifer voices concern, Fotis calls her a failure and threatens to take their children from her. On May 24, 2019, Jennifer went missing and no one ever heard from her again.  Aubrey believes Fotis knows more than he will tell, but Fotis believes Jennifer is another Gone Girl.  As police delve into their marriage, they will find a nasty divorce, a custody battle, car seats, and an alibi script.<br/><br/>Often, courts and police don't take verbal and emotional abuse as seriously as physical abuse.  But it can, and in Jennifer's case, does have the same horrific end. Of course, this movie doesn't give all the information.  Nevertheless, it shows the timeline of their marriage, their divorce, and Jennifer's murder.  If you don't know the story, understand that there are no winners. This movie displays the horrible end of marriage to an abusive narcissist.  It's hard to watch, but something to learn from and discuss.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dutch",
    "review":"Over a decade ago, Bernard James worked in a local pizza shop owned by Roberto.  A man came in with a gun demanding the money in the register.  Roberto gave the robber the money, but Bernard told the robber about the safe in the back.  While the robber forced Roberto to empty the safe, Bernard got a gun and shot the robber.  Bernard didn't know the Italian mob financially backed the pizza shop. The leader, Fat Tony, asks Bernard why he works at the shop, and Bernard responded with concern for his mother and money.  Fat Tony thinks Bernard is an upstanding guy and changes his name to Dutch. Then, they make him a part of the operation. Today, Dutch is one of the most revered and feared dealers in New Jersey.  He walks into a restaurant and sits down at Michelle Nichols's table. He knows Michelle is a defense attorney that understands disparity among conviction rates and race. A few months ago, a suicide bomber walked into the 27th Police Precinct and detonated his bomb.  That act killed dozens of officers and injured more.  The police believe Dutch forced the bomber to commit the crime and issued a warrant for his arrest. While she is rejecting his case, the police come in and arrest Dutch. The police ask Michelle who she is, and she states that she is his lawyer.  During this trial, Michelle will discover the criminal within the man.  But is he guilty?<br/><br/>Based on Dutch by Teri Woods, this movie uses testimony to go through the life of Dutch.  Throughout his life, Dutch had to think three moves ahead of everyone else.  Now, the entire police force hates him, along with the prosecuting attorney, Anthony Jacobs. Michelle has no idea if he is guilty.  But when she becomes a target, she starts to believe Dutch.  While this movie slows down in the middle, it makes up for the lag with an explosive ending.  Don't be surprised if you want to pick up the second book in the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Secrets She Keeps",
    "review":"Amara is the odd-girl out in a new school.  She has social anxiety, and it's hard for her to make friends.  On her first day, Amara tries to get her chemistry book, but Jake informs her that she doesn't have one because she registered too late for classes. Jack and Amara spark a conversation, and she leaves with a crush.  Before class, Heather and Becky stop Amara to asks her about homecoming themes.  Amara gives her opinion, hoping to make friends, but they brush her off immediately.  Later, Amara meets her mom, Diana, at Diana's future gallery. During the sale, Shane approaches. As they talk, Amara smells smoke coming from the gallery.  An intruder broke in, trapped Diana in her office, and lit a fire. Later, Amara tries to put it out of her mind at school and gets some unforeseen assistance.  Heather and Becky ask her to join the homecoming committee. They inquire if Amara has a boyfriend, and she tells them she doesn't, but she has a crush.  They want to know more, then Jack walks in and kisses Heather.  Amara's crush is Heather's boyfriend.  Amara decides to stay mum about her crush, but Heather can see something is afoot.  The girls decide to create an online dating profile for Amara to focus her attention on another boy.  On the dating app, they lie and say Amara is 18, not 16. After swiping, Amara sees a familiar face, Shane.  They match, and she goes out to see him.  On their date, he tells her that he isn't 19; he is 23.  But she decides to keep seeing him.  With more gallery break-ins and vandalism, Diana suspects Shane is behind them.  So, she wants him out of Amara's life.  Amara refuses to believe Shane could do those things and starts sneaking out to see him.  Amara can't see the evil in front of her and what he will do if she doesn't bend to his will.<br/><br/>A year ago, this plot would be too far-fetched.  Nevertheless, with people losing their jobs, it's easy to see how someone could crack and go to the lengths Shane does.  While watching Shane is compelling, Amara garners little to no sympathy. Before you get too mad, remember that Shane is her first experience with a boyfriend. Amara will have to learn the hard way while people die.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Party Gone Wrong",
    "review":"Brittney and Taylor try to convince their friend, April, to go to a party.  But April doesn't want to because her ex-boyfriend, Sam, and her ex-friend, Natalie, will be there.  Three months ago, Sam cheated on April with Natalie, and April wants nothing to do with either of them.  After talking to her mother, Ms. Bishop, April decides to go out and have a good time. When Brittney hears April's grievances with Sam and Taylor's budding friendship, Brittney admits she planned the party with Sam.  Upset, April goes to the bathroom to clear her mind.  But that does her no good because Natalie is there and wants to hash things out.  April refused to listen and walks out.  Taylor gives April a few drinks to unwind, and it doesn't take long for April to feel the effects.  April calls a rideshare, and Taylor helps her to the car.  As the car goes down the road, April's concern grows.  Soon, the driver gets out and attacks her.  He, along with an accomplice, drag April into a freezer and lock her inside.  April tries to think of a way to get out when she hears a commotion outside the freezer.  The door opens, and another woman falls inside.  It's Natalie.  The two women need to get over their differences and work together to save themselves.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie sheds light on another cause for human trafficking.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself screaming at the T.V. because Ms. Bishop refuses to call the police.  Remember, police in Lifetime movies are useless props that only put on handcuffs at the end. And this movie adds fight scenes that will grab your attention.  Not just pushing and shoving, but weapons, fists, and sweet revenge.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
