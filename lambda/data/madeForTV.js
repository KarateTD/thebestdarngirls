    "review":"Peggy Sue, Janice, and Brenna are sisters who are all unhappy with their love lives.  Peggy Sue is single and looking for love, Janice is getting a divorce, and Brenna fights with her husband Russell every day.  At Sam's funeral, Peggy Sue spots her old crush Jim Huden. By the end of the funeral, they are in bed together.  The next day, Peggy Sue visits Brenna at Brenna's hair salon.  Peggy Sue brags about getting Jim while Brenna complains about Russell.  Seeing her sister isn't focused on her happiness, Peggy Sue becomes upset and reminds Brenna that her rent is due.  Weeks later, Peggy Sue leaves their small town to move to Las Vegas to be with Jim. Janice comes to visit and complains about her divorce, and Jim offers to kill Janice's husband.  Horrified, Janice promptly declines and leaves in disgust.  Brenna makes a surprise visit to Peggy Sue with good and bad news.  She decided to divorce Russell, but she won't be able to buy Peggy Sue's house.  Peggy Sue needs money now because Jim lied about his financial standing. Peggy Sue remembers Brenna mentioning that Russell had three life insurance policies.  With that money, Brenna could buy Peggy Sue's home, and Peggy Sue can keep Jim by her side. The day after Christmas, Russell is dead, and police knock on Brenna's door.  Solving this case will cause a domino effect of awful choices.<br/><br/>Based on Ann Rule's true crime book Practice to Deceive, this movie starts slow, but the last 30 minutes will leave you flabbergasted.  Former beauty queen Peggy Sue uses her charms to con anyone in her life, and the first half of the movie allows the audience to understand the depths of Peggy Sue's depravity. However, Peggy Sue never says what she wants outright.  She allows people to infer.  In the end, Peggy Sue asks one question: Did I do anything wrong.  Well, did she?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
