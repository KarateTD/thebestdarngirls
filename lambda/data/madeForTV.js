    "mtitle":"Faith Heist 2: A Christmas Caper",
    "review":"Reverand Benjamin and his crew are working at the local mall to raise money for the Children's Hospital. Marge manages the mall and convinces Himmel's Jewelers to provide the tree topper. The Christmas Star is worth $1,000,000. While Benjamin plays Santa, Jack is his elf, who takes pictures of Santa with the kids. Gabs makes holiday treats that no one wants while Nas and Skipper set up the camera. Last year, this group pulled off a Faith Heist to save Benjamin's church after a con man investor stole their money. After they took down the investor, Dan lost his security job. Marge hired him because he wasn't a part of the lies. Dan won't allow another heist to happen on his watch, so he keeps an eye on Benjamin and the entire crew. Dan is correct to be worried because someone plans to steal The Christmas Star and lay the blame on Benjamin. Can the team take down the robber before Dan pins the crime on them?<br/><br/>This sequel allows the characters to grow while providing Home Alone antics. Since the movie focuses on the characters' hopes and dreams, they don't understand a heist is in the works. The story focuses on their interconnected relationships as the heist goes on in the background. Unlike the first movie, they create a plan on the fly in the last 30 minutes. This movie isn't a stand-out like the first, but it provides some laughs for the holidays.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma created a presentation but accidently destroyed it by removing the artificial snow. Her boss, Mr. Hayden, decides to cancel her meeting.

Emma sees Max in the elevator, and he invites her to his house for a Christmas party. However, she can't go because she has a flight to catch in the morning. Emma's parents called earlier to discuss their family traditions. And they have her old high school friend, Drew, to help. Before Emma enters her apartment, she talks to a donation Santa.

She jumps out of bed and catches a taxi. She sprints to the terminal and asks the attendant if she made the flight. That's when the story splits into two. In one version, she makes her plane and spends the holiday with her family and Drew. In the second version, she misses her plane and spends the holiday with Max and work.<br/><br/>This holiday movie makes viewers do a double take as Emma's double life plays out simultaneously. Now, there is some overlap in the stories. And, Emma learns the direct effect of her actions.

Aaliyah wants to join and offers to bring in sponsors for a quid pro quo. Then, Curtis, Aaliyah's mover, enters to ask a question. After her answer, he asks Kira out, but she says no because of his employment.<br/><br/>Aaliyah gets home and immediately posts for her Peaches to send recipes.

    "mtitle":"Fatal Family Reunion",
    "review":"Sloane leaves the recording studio after getting tragic news that her stepmother, Avery, died. Sloane returns to her family's estate for the funeral and the reading of the will. Then her stepsister, Lexi, gives Sloane a thinly veiled insult. Since her room is gone, the housekeeper, Wendy, helps Sloane to the attic. Sloane tries to run out of the attic. But someone locked her in, causing her to panic. Soon her stepbrother, Blake, opens the door with a devious grin. Sloane screams at Blake for being immature and runs to her brother, David, for comfort. Sloane is ready to leave and return to her boyfriend, Malik. However, David tells Sloane she must stay. Avery has a stipulation that they must all be present to read the will. Sloane promises to remain until the meeting, but that's a colossal mistake. Someone in this reunion wants to destroy the family, but will that person succeed before Sloane finds the truth?<br/><br/>This movie tries to add curveballs with suspicious actions, deplorable pasts, and an inheritance. However, experienced Lifetimers can easily pick the killer. It's the 'why' that keeps you watching the television. Just a warning, the 'why' is pretty pitiful. Nevertheless, seeing Sloane piece the puzzle together is entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
