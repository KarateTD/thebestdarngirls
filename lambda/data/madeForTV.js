  "mtitle":"The Dancing Detective: A Deadly Tango",
  "review":"Captain Kelly calls Detective Constance Bailey into his office. He congratulates her for solving a case with extreme tenacity. However, Bailey doesn't work well with others. He must know she can collaborate before he gives her a high-profile case. The senator's brother, Mark Aston, died of a suspected heart attack. However, his family believes foul play was involved because Mark didn't have heart problems. Since Mark died in Malta, Bailey will have to go overseas and work with Interpol to investigate. Bailey promises to collaborate with her new partner.<br/><br/>Bailey meets her Interpol liaison, Sgt. Ana. Mark ran a dancing, team-building competition for his company. The competition is in a few days, and everyone will fly home. If someone killed Mark, the culprit will be out of reach soon. Ana tells Bailey that she will go undercover as an employee and dancer in the competition. Ana found a partner for Bailey named Sebastian. He is a dance instructor and pseudo-celebrity. Their undercover names are Steward and Sally. Sebastian meets Bailey, makes her put her hair down, and teaches her to Foxtrot.<br/><br/>Ana takes Bailey and Sebastian to the Iniala Hotel because the competitors, also suspects, are staying there. The event's liaison, Barbara, introduces Sebastian and Bailey as Steward and Sally. Mary, Mark's widow, greets them with a warm smile and zero sadness for Mark's death. Mary introduces them to Jennifer and Tom. Tom is the CFO, and Jennifer is the head of marketing. Kevin, the event's director, describes the group as one big happy family. Bailey wants to talk to Judy, the maid who found Mark's body, before they question Mark's employees. Sebastian wants to divide, conquer and help. When Bailey tries to blow him off, he says they must collaborate. She remembers Captain Kelly's words and decides to let Sebastian help, but only after they dance. Will they prove someone murdered Mark and find the culprit before the end of the competition?<br/><br/>The Dancing Detective has a twist for other H.M.M. mysteries. Bailey isn't a woman with another job who loves enigmas. She is a detective who prefers to work alone. Sebastian is the hanger-on who wants to play cop. However, his dance skills give him the ability to read body language. Sebastian leads on the dancefloor, but Bailey holds the top spot in the investigation. It will be interesting to see how these two will become partners again if this becomes a series. Sleuthers, prepare to watch this film two or three times to keep up.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"You'll Never Leave Me",
  "review":"April takes a deep breath and gathers the strength to break up with Patrick. He told her he got a separation from his wife, Susan. But Richard is married and living with her. Patrick drives April home.. During the ride, they get into an accident. April suffers a broken arm, but Patrick is in a coma.<br/><br/>After healing, the doctors tell April she can go home. April walks to Patrick's room to speak to Susan. April tries to apologize, but Susan won't hear it. She blames April for the accident and the affair. April wants to return to work, but her panic attacks are too severe. With help, April believes this is the start of a new life. But Susan has other plans. She wants April to pay for what happened to Patrick. Susan hires her brother-in-law, Jimmy, to get close to April and kill her. What will Susan do when her Trojan Horse becomes another lovesick puppy under April's spell?<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way. April is not a season! With that said, this movie is a slow burn with a low body count. And everyone makes blaring mistakes in the film. Then, the writers added a dream that may or may not have been real. But never explain if it was later. This film moves too slowly to keep your interest and doesn't have enough kills to be exciting.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"The Love Club: Tara's Tune",
  "review":"Tara takes a selfie with her date, sends it to her mom, excuses him for the evening, and sits on a car's hood. She follows Nicole to Lauren and Peter's New Year's party. They discuss their failed love lives, and her friends tell Tara to delete her latest app. Nicole thinks it's the first step to Tara's next dead-end relationship. The four lovelorn ladies name themselves the Love Club.<br/><br/>Today, Tara finishes her set and leaves the stage. Sam asks Tara to marry him after taking a picture with him and sending it to her mom, Nadine. Tara tells Sam she doesn't want a commitment and gets on stage to make a proclamation. This year will be the Year of Tara. Tara returns home with an idea and calls the Love Club. Later, Noah walks into the bar and asks for an audition. He needs money until he gets his big break. Tara listens to Noah and hires him on the spot.<br/><br/>Sydney, Nicole, and Lauren descend onto Tara's home. Then they find her declaration online, and it's viral. Tara is happy about the video and asks the Love Club to plan her commitment party for herself. The soiree doesn't put the Love Club at ease, but they agree to do it for Tara. As Tara and Noah create music together, the women see their connection but continue planning. Nicole decides to call Nadine about the wedding, and Nadine can't contain her surprise. Nadine assumed that Tara got engaged and never told her. Tara ignores Nadine until Nadine comes to town wanting to meet Tara's fiancé. Now, Tara needs a fiancé to convince her mother that the wedding is real. Later, she will give Nadine a fake breakup story.<br/><br/>Tara runs to Noah and begs Noah to be her fake betrothed. Noah refuses because he takes marriage seriously. Noah goes to his van and sees a tow truck taking it away. He runs to Tara's side as she talks to Nadine and introduces himself as her fiancé. When Nadine leaves, Noah says that his mind changed. The Love Club notices Noah and Tara's fake relationship looks real. The women will work together to help Tara see that she doesn't have to fear commitment and that Noah is the man for her.<br/><br/>This fourth Love Club installment starts differently than the others. Tara never desired love like her friends. Her 'happily ever after' was a record deal, not a husband. She must repair her relationship with Nadine to move forward. Seeing them sit and talk things through will put viewers at ease. Tara can move forward with Noah afterward. This movie is a solid conclusion for these women, but it doesn't feel like the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
