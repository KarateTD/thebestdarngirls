    "mtitle":"Abducted by My Teacher: The Elizabeth Thomas Story",
    "review":"At 15, Elizabeth Thomas, aka Beth, attends school for the first time. Elizabeth's father, Ed, works double and triple shifts to care for his three children, while her brother, Ben, helps when he can.<br/><br/>Beth can't find someone to sit with during lunch and eats by her locker. Her science teacher, Tad Cummins, offers his assistance. He relates to being new and ostracized. He introduces her to a group of students - Tim, Brandy, and Rachel - willing to invite Beth into their circle. After school, Beth misses the bus, and Tad offers her a ride home. He notices a cut on her hand and gives her first aid. Beth appreciates the kindness Tad provides. This act is innocent to Beth. But it's the first step in Tad's grooming process. Tad slowly manipulates Beth and leads the police on a nationwide hunt after kidnapping her. Beth has no idea the horror, ridicule, and coercion she will need to overcome then and now.<br/><br/>Tad follows the groomer's guide like a playbook. The administrators gave Tad Beth's background. And he knew she was a prime target. He isolated her by making Beth stay behind after the other students left. Then, he set up a bed in a closet and added his number to her phone under another name to engage her in a secret. Next, Tad made several inappropriate comments to gauge her response. Finally, he used words like 'soulmate' to make his behavior look normal. The writers steered clear of re-enacting any assault to focus on grooming and public shaming, not violence. This movie is a teaching tool to warn young kids and teens of these wolves in sheep's clothing.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Big Sky River: The Bridal Path",
    "review":"Tara calls Boone from New York. James wanted Erin to attend his and Bethany's baby shower and gender reveal. When blue confetti falls, James thanks the heavens for the son he always wanted. Erin takes offense and wants to leave the party, James, and New York behind.<br/><br/>Tara and Erin return to Parable to join Boone and his sons, Griffin and Fletcher, who gleefully await them. They settle into their lives as a blended family, but it's not complete until Boone gets down on one knee to propose. Tara says yes without hesitation. Fletcher welcomes Tara and Erin into their family, but Erin and Griffin aren't happy. Tara has two families and feels unwanted in one. Griffin doesn't want to replace his mother. With so much change, will Tara and Boone's relationship survive the pressure?<br/><br/>Based on Big Sky Summer by Linda Lael Miller and the sequel to Big River Sky, this story goes to the heart of blending families with the pressure of orchestrating a wedding. Unlike the book, this movie focuses on Tara and Boone's evolving relationship, not Casey and Peter's. Like most couples, Tara and Boone avoided the tough conversations to focus on bliss. It's a lot for everyone to handle. This film can spark heartfelt and open dialogue in blended families.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Danger Lurking Under My Roof",
    "review":"Mark created a Tiny Home project and wants his house to be the inaugural home. The project has families with large properties that put a Tiny Home on their grounds for a family in need to stay. Mark's wife, Roxanne, and daughter, Macie, are excited to help, but Roxanne feels it's too soon. Mark tells Roxanne the family won't interfere in their lives and that the family is a struggling single mother and her daughter. Roxanne has empathy for the family and green-lights the idea.<br/><br/>Ella and Lucy stay at a motel. The front desk attendant tells Lucy they have a call. Ella snatches the cord out of the wall. Ella tells Lucy to leave calls unanswered, keep calls to friends cryptic, and never reveal their location. She hopes the new house will be a fresh start.<br/><br/>Ella and Lucy move into Roxanne and Mark's backyard. Roxanne brings them a plant and invites them to a welcome dinner. During dinner, Roxanne gives Ella the rental agreement. It stipulates noise hours, number of party guests, and counseling. Ella takes the paperwork with a forced smile and leaves with Lucy. This move is the first battle in the war between these two women. However, something more dangerous is lurking and coming for their daughters.<br/><br/>These women are the definition of petty, and both are in the wrong. Also, the script follows the same path. It focuses on them so much that viewers have no idea what's going on. The final ten minutes wrap up with a fight and a conclusion pulled out of thin air. And, it leaves some questions unanswered. This film is three movies rolled into one with little guidance to chart the plot.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Making Waves",
    "review":"Amelia hears the band, Figure 8, on her smart device and sends the link to her boss, Lydia, to review. Lydia admits she never saw Amelia's link and then reminds Amelia of their staff meeting.<br/><br/>During the meeting, Lydia tells the team their biggest competitor, run by her ex-husband, RJ, continues to take their potential clients. RJ's company has more money, but Lydia believes they have a leg up with artist freedom. Amelia pitches Figure 8, but Lydia thinks indie pop is pass√©. Amelia rebuts by stating the band has a growing following on social media. Lydia tells Amelia to track them down because a following could equal album sales.<br/><br/>Amelia travels to a small town for the OBX Making Waves Music Festival. To her surprise, her high school friend, Will, works at the local pub. Will warmly greets Amelia and informs her that he is there to fill in to assist his uncle, Ted. She tells Will she's in town to offer Figure 8 a deal with Dream It Real Records. But she can't find information or a clear image of the band. Will tells Amelia the band is performing at the pub tonight. She bounces with excitement but leaves for a brief moment to answer Lydia's call.<br/><br/>Lydia tells Amelia to sign Figure 8 quickly for a promotion to Head of the Indie Division. Amelia re-enters the pub with a steely determination to sign the band, but they already performed while she was outside.<br/><br/>Amelia sees RJ at the festival and knows he is scouting bands too. Then, Amelia sees Figure 8 hit the stage. She stands in awe to see Will singing lead. She offers them a deal on the spot with creative control of their look and sound. Will loves the deal, but he has other priorities. Ted leases a dock for the pub, but a commercial developer wants to purchase it. RJ offered Figure 8 a lucrative record contract that will cover the cost of the dock. Amelia must get Will on her label for the promotion, but an unforeseen wrinkle will hinder her plans.<br/><br/>This movie is charming and has catchy music. The plot has several moving parts but comes together at the end. But the overall message is a dream deferred isn't a dream denied. Everyone in this film has a fear that stops them from achieving their ultimate goal. They need to lean on each other to get over the hurdles in front of them. While the ending is predictable, it's worth watching.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Final Say",
    "review":"Valerie gets a call from her friend, Lindsey, while preparing for a blind date. Lindsey assures Valerie that Vaughn is the perfect man for her and wishes Valerie good luck. Valerie and Vaughn fall head over heels in love with each other and marry. They buy an exquisite home and dream of filling it with children. After five years and miscarriages, Valerie's disappointment grows.<br/><br/>Before her 10th anniversary party, Valerie takes a pregnancy test, and it's positive. Vaughn wants to scream it from the rooftop, but Valerie tells him to keep it quiet. Vaughn can't contain his excitement and lets everyone know Valerie is pregnant. The family cheers for them, but the celebration is short-lived. It was a false positive. She doesn't feel that she can give Vaughn everything he wants. So, Valerie decides to divorce Vaughn to avoid future resentment. Can Vaughn save his marriage?<br/><br/>This movie tackles a sensitive subject for many couples with a blanket of faith for comfort. The ability to have and carry children looks effortless from the outside because women rarely talk about fertility hardships until now. Viewers should watch this film and create a safe space for an open dialog about infertility, pregnancy, miscarriages, and family alternatives.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
