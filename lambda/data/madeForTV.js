    "review":"Mrs. Bennet wants her 5 daughters to find a rich, handsome, strong husband.  Her daughter, Lizzie, is an activist who wants to stop the building of a strip mall.  She meets Antwone, a future congressmen, they argue and he asks her on a date.  She laughs and run away.  Then, William Darcy meets Lizzie in a wedding and refuses to talk to him.  Finally, Stevie, a future church leader wants Lizzie after Jane said no.<br/><br/>Mrs. Bennet's dialogue will have you laughing and quoting for days.  Their are a few lines from the book, so listen hard.  It was funny for teens and up.  But, this movie feels more like a future TV series than a movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

However, she offers to help spruce up the inn with help from her ex, Kai.  Will the sparks between them continue when Evan comes to surprise her.<br/><br/>It's a sweet movie that puts the main love story in the background for a festival and another love story.

When she spots a missing flyer with a girl wearing the same necklace, she confronts her rental home owner, James.  At first he denies knowing the missing girl until Eliza acknowledges the necklace.  Now, she wants to leave but her friends want to stay one more day.  This decision will prove fatal.<br/><br/>Be ready to slap a cop in the face.  It only takes a few nice words and baked goods for the police to love James and shoot down anyone who disagrees with him.  This plot does have exciting moments but you will roll your eyes at dumb Lifetime mistakes made by each character.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Stressed to Death",
    "review":"Maggie was able to save a pregnant woman during a convenience store robbery, but a man was murdered.  With her time in the service, this only added to her PTSD.  Ten years later, Maggie is ready to go back to work as an EMT.  After taking her test, Maggie comes home to find her husband shot and her daughter kidnapped.  Maggie and her family's life is on the line unless she finds out who is behind it all.<br/><br/>This movie breaks the Lifetime mold.  It ramps up in the first 10 minutes and keeps going.  The villain is devious and diabolical.  She feeds her husband's ashes to a venus fly trap and wants to watch the murder of Maggie's family.  You will watch this movie on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
