She agrees, but he must drive straight home.<br/><br/>Johnnie orders and sees a young man, Tim, harassing a young woman, Leslie. Johnnie tells Tim to leave Leslie alone, or Johnnie will disqualify Tim from making the baseball team. Tim lunges for Lesley again when Leslie's mother, Carlie, enters. Carlie forces Tim to leave and grounds Leslie for poor grades. Then, she turns to Johnnie and questions him about not going home like he promised. Johnnie asks Carlie on a date. She says no because she has three daughters, Lesley, Courtney, and Tessa. While he's never dated a woman with kids, Johnnie isn't scared to try. He asks Carlie for a chance.

Carlie and Johnnie fall for each other but deal with integrating him into the family. As life eases, they get a gut punch that will leave your jaw on the floor. She wants Johnnie to feel welcome but needs her daughters to feel heard. Johnnie learns that dating a woman with kids comes with different priorities.

    "mtitle": "Nelly Knows Mysteries: A Fatal Engagement",
    "review": "Nelly reports to work and discusses her column with Fiona. Nelly cycles through her mail and finds a letter without a return address. The letter is from a woman who suspects her boyfriend of cheating. Nelly, from the small town of Babbleton, knows everyone and recognizes the hearts above the I's. The letter is from Dahlia, who is dating Blake. Nelly wants to handle this face-to-face.<br/><br/>Nelly arrives at Blake's workshop and finds the door open. She peers inside and finds Blake dead with $20,000 in his pocket. Nelly calls the police. Sheriff Burgi introduces Nelly to the new detective, Michael. Michael interviews Nelly about finding the body. Nelly reveals everything and hands Michael the cash. Burgi gives this case to Michael to prove himself, but she tells Michael to work with Nelly because Nelly knows the town. Dahlia says she spoke to Blake the night before, but he rushed her off the phone. She doesn't think he was cheating but keeping a secret. Nelly tells Dahlia to talk to Michael but convinces Michael to let her sit with Dahlia during the interview. Dahlia completes the interrogation, and Michael allows her to exit, but she remains a suspect. Nelly promises to clear Dahlia's name. Can Nelly and Michael find Blake's killer?<br/><br/>This plot has several moving parts and people with bad intentions. The night before Blake's murder, Blake had a poker game. Each player had a secret. Blake has a neighbor, Rumple, who dislikes him and his prior devious acts. Nelly is a new type of protagonist for Hallmark Mystery fans. She is unapologetically happy and keeps an earth-shattering grin on her face. However, you learn that her smile holds a lot of pain. The wrap-up pushes lots of information in 10 minutes and will require a second watch to keep up. Nevertheless, this film can become a series with a developing romance.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trapped in the Rocky Mountains",
    "review": "Carrie won a contest for a one-night stay at a 4-star cabin in the Rocky Mountains. She rejoices in her prize as she drives to the cabin with her husband, Chef Jared. Carrie doesn't care about the cell service because she wants this weekend to focus on their marriage.<br/><br/>They notice strange things when they approach the cabin. The cabin's front door is ajar, the property is empty, and there is no WiFi. Carrie hears noises outside and sees two people walking towards the property. Jared recognizes them. It's Wes and his sister, Lizzie. Wes works for a travel magazine. The editor sent him to the cabin to write about it. He asked Lizzie to come.<br/><br/>They tour the cabin when they hear more voices in the sitting area. It's Harrison and Rayanne. Rayanne plans to meet a client tomorrow, and Harrison was there to meet a woman he met online. Jared tells Carrie they were friends in college but haven't seen each other in ten years. They consider leaving, but all decide to stay the night. After nightfall, Harrison decides to leave. Carrie reminds him that the next town is 2 hours away, but he takes the chance. Later, Harrison returns because someone locked the iron gate. They can't exit the property.<br/><br/>Carrie can see the tension rising within the group and asks Jared to explain privately. Jared tells Carrie that they came to a cabin like this ten years ago with their friend Ashley. Ashley decided to play Death Poker. The players are all in or fold. The last person would have to stay in the woods all night alone. Ashley lost. She went into the woods and went missing in the morning. Later, the police declared Ashley dead. Carrie talks to the group and uncovers critical information Jared didn't reveal. They didn't tell the police about the game and said she wandered off after hiking. Now, they think someone blames them and wants them to confess. They must find a way out or suffer, but who can they trust?<br/><br/>This movie starts with people making poor decisions. It's ill-advised for them but the perfect setup for the audience. The characters are people with a loose moral compass. During an intense conversation, the kid gloves come off, and they don't hold their punches. It is a popcorn and tea moment for the viewers. The story revisits old scenes that you missed during the recap. This picture is beyond wild and will enthrall you, but you have to get past their first set of poor choices.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Everyone knows that where Emily goes, disaster follows.<br/><br/>The women skip the bachelorette party and join the bridal party for a swim.

Emily promises to return after finding her bag. Ryan knows the countryside and offers to go with Emily. Emily and Ryan expect to find the monkey and get Emily's bag back. If not, Emily will lose the heirloom rings forever and ruin Phoebe and Jamal's wedding.<br/><br/>This movie increases the comedy in a rom-com as Emily and Ryan bumble through the jungle. Their adventure includes run-ins with venomous snakes, mud pits, and thieving monkeys. However, it forces them to converse and work through their issues. You may view Emily as a stubborn whiner who causes her calamities. However, Ryan's speech saves the day. The scenery is as beautiful as the friendships. This film is for good-humored people with patience.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
