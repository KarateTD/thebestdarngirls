    "review":"Morgan sits with her friend, Emmy, before going to a doctor's appointment. Morgan doesn't want to go but will do it to keep her mother, Kim, off her back. Morgan's doctor says Morgan is healthy, but she needs to lose weight. Morgan and Kim return home to grab items before a meeting. When Morgan takes too long, Kim runs inside to check on Morgan. Kim sees Morgan shockingly holding her father's phone. Kim grabs the phone and sees sexual text messages from another woman. Later, Kim has Nick's packed bags by the door.<br/><br/>Kim looks up Nick's mistress online and questions how she got a stunning body. In several posts, the mistress credits a fitness influencer's plan. Kim starts the plan and throws away 'unhealthy' foods. Kim joins a gym for herself and Morgan. Kim believes she is living her best life and saving Morgan from an unhealthy future. But Morgan is spiraling out of control for the perfect body, love, and acceptance.<br/><br/>For the first time, Lifetime covers atypical eating disorders. On the outside, Morgan looks overweight. So others applauded when she lost pounds, or they said it was not enough. This film reveals the doctor's mistake. He never tests Morgan for other issues. Instead, he focuses on the surface. And when Morgan reveals how long she has had problems, it will break your heart. This movie shows why body-shaming is horrible and its dire consequences. Parents, teens, and kids should watch.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Boarding School Murders",
    "review":"Frankie received unbelievable news. She got into Limoux Boarding School overseas. She is happy to leave her foster home and the bad memories of her father in the past.<br/><br/>Frankie arrives and meets the headmistress, Ms. Ainsworth. Ms. Ainsworth lays down the law and shows Frankie to her room. Frankie unpacks as Jacqueline enters. Jacqueline admits she doesn't have friends and asks Frankie to be hers. Frankie loves Jacqueline's honesty and agrees to become friends.<br/><br/>Jacqueline tells Frankie where to sit in the cafeteria and points out the cool girls, Maria, Annabelle, and Tinsley. Tinsley is the leader and walks over with the followers in tow. Frankie puts Tinsley in her place, but Tinsley gets the last word. Later, Frankie hears a scream outside of her bedroom. Everyone leaves their bed and finds Tinsley's dead body at the bottom of the steps. Annabelle and Maria instantly point their fingers at Frankie. Frankie has to prove her innocence before someone discovers her past and blames Tinsley's murder on her.<br/><br/>This whodunit is a challenging and worthwhile mystery. It will throw the most experienced Lifetimers for a loop. Please understand that the movie starts slow because the plot gives Frankie time to investigate. Also, Tinsley's pack evolves in the script. They change from hell-bound monsters to productive women. As a warning, one scene will make you ill, but get past it for an intriguing mystery.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
