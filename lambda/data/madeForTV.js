    "review":"Six months ago, someone called Aubrey and her friends the seven deadly sins.  At first, the girls hated it, but now they embrace it. Aubrey is Pride because she likes to answer questions in class to prove she is better than everyone else. They gave Tori Wrath because she is angry at the world for everything.  Finally, virgin Grace is Lust. Grace goes home to her family after school, and her father, Pastor Dean, is filled with rage.  Someone confessed to the Dean about Grace and her friends.  He wants Grace to come home directly after school and to stop hanging out with the Sins. And since the town's talking, Grace decides to live up to her sin.  But first, she has to find out who snitched to her dad in their confessional.  During class, Grace grabs Aubrey's journal while Aubrey went to the bathroom.  Inside the journal, the ladies reveal that Aubrey kept an account of every bad thing they had ever done.  They decide to teach her a lesson.  Overcome with guilt, Grace stops and pulls the girls aside to talk sense into them.  But when they turn around, Aubrey is gone. A few days later, Aubrey's body is in a lake with a rose in her mouth. Grace wants to find the killer before the killer comes after her.<br/><br/>This movie starts as The Craft and morphs into a Lifetime mystery after the first hour.  However, the plot will leave some behind as the killer monologues with details about the crime and why they did it. As Aubrey takes you through the events that brought on her demise, you cross off suspects in your head.  But with seven deadly sins, you may need a notebook and a pen to keep it straight.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jim wants to have his home redecorated before his wife, Miranda, and daughter, Chelsea, come home from Rome.  After looking up interior designers online, Jim calls Ava because he likes her portfolio. When Ava finishes the job, she sits Jim down to talk, but Miranda and Chelsea come home early.  The changes to the home pleasantly surprise the women, but no one sees Ava's fury.  For days, Ava fantasized about Jim leaving his wife for her. Jim has no idea the evil he brought into his life.<br/><br/>This movie is something you have to watch closely and with a quality screen.  If you pay attention, you will see that Ava named all the cameras she installed in the house.  This small detail lets you inside her mind's depraved state.Like Ava, have popcorn at the ready.  And if you have a small TV, have a pause button to read the screen or glasses. It will be worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hannah's mother, Delores, buzzes with excitement because her book launch party is in a few days. Hannah's sister, Michelle, came to town for the party, and Hannah shares the town gossip.  Days before, as Delores and Hannah bickered, a woman confronted a customer, Ronni, calls Ronni a homewrecker, and throws a drink in Ronni's face. With the events behind her, Hannah goes to her morning spin class.  Afterward, she sees Ronni's car with the word homewrecker spray-painted on the side.  The next day, Hannah goes to the gym's jacuzzi with Michelle to relax but finds Ronni dead.  With an FBI agent looking over Mike's shoulder, Mike and Hannah will investigate Ronni's co-workers, ex-husband, and current lover to crack the case.<br/><br/>Have your Candy Bar Cookies, Blueberry Crunch Cookies, and Mega Chocolate Chip Cookies nearby for this mystery.  Based on Cream Puff Murder by Joanne Fluke, this movie turns up the gossip before presenting the audience with a murder.  Unlike other mysteries that give you a glimpse of the victim before their death, you feel like a fly on the wall as you see Ronni's life unfolding in front of you. This killer's reveal will stun you with just a small item.  Don't worry, this mystery has a new title but the same great stories.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Professor Dr. Stone is not happy with her teaching assistant and student, Julia.  Julia arrived late again, but she promises it won't happen anymore. For the students' next assignment, Dr. Stone wants them to interview a convicted criminal and write a profile.  But Julia still has to research information for Dr. Stone's next book.  It's Erin to the rescue.  Erin is Dr. Stone's second teaching assistant, a criminology student, and Julia's best friend and roommate. Erin will find the criminal to interview, and Julia will finish Dr. Stone's research.  By the end of the night, Erin hands Cole's information to an exhausted Julia.  A jury convicted Cole of killing a married couple after the wife rejected his advances. During the interview, Cole still declares his innocence while Erin flirts with him.  But as they write their profiles, new evidence in Cole's case frees him.  A man committed suicide and left a note admitting that he killed the couple. After Erin and Julia request more time for their paper, Cole meets them in the campus courtyard.  Cole focuses on Julia, but Erin focuses on him. Later that night, Erin meets up with Cole at a bar and sleeps with him. But when Erin goes missing, Julia wonders if Cole got away with murder, and now, kidnapping.<br/><br/>Talk about burying the lead.  This movie's title gives nothing away because there isn't a love triangle.  Julia nor Dr. Stone show interest nor profess love for Cole throughout the film. Erin's disappearance forces Julia to take the lead and look into the crime as a working profiler.  While the title is misleading, the case is intriguing.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Efficiency blogger, Lauren, creates tips so we can maximize our time and have 27 hours in a day.  Her blog gained national attention, including that of Barbara Davrow.  Barbara hosts speaking engagements each year, and the guest speakers get TV shows, book deals, and expanded brands.  When Barbara calls Lauren for a meet-and-greet, Lauren can barely hide her enthusiasm. Barbara, while the queen of efficiency, believes in an adequate work-life balance.  Barbara becomes increasingly concerned when she learns that Lauren has never taken a vacation. Lauren wants to make a good impression on Barbara, so Lauren decides to take a break.  After researching online, Lauren found a 'no tech' vacation and makes reservations at the Meadowlawn Retreat. On her second day, she tries to take a relaxing walk and spots a farmhand named Jack.  He is part-owner of the Meadowlawn.  And Jack works as the handyman while overseeing the retreat's expansion. Throughout Lauren's stay, they keep bumping into each other.  Each time, Jack helps Lauren find the peace that she lost.  However, Jack will need her expertise.  Meadowlawn's investors may decide to go with a bigger hotel chain, but they offer Jack another opportunity to present his proposal.  Lauren rolls up her sleeves to help Jack prepare. As she works with Jack and his family, Lauren discovers the Jack behind the businessman.  Is helping Meadowlawn hurting Jack's aspirations?<br/><br/>Jack's dreams give this storyline a much-needed twist.  It's pretty easy to see where Lauren's plot will conclude, but giving Jack an aspiration to pursue is a nice change.  In the end, you will start to worry if these two will become a couple. The writers, like Lauren, made efficient use of the plot.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
