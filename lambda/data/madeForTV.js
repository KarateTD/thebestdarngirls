    "review":"Rachel is effervescent after her baptism and sees the world differently. Her mother, Sarah, is pleased because Rachel can get married and fulfill her duty of having a family and caring for a husband. Rachel helps her mother until she hears a horrible voice, Uncle Iddo.<br/><br/>Later, Rachel cares for Sarah after Sarah has a dizzy spell. And Rachel hears a gut-wrenching song coming from upstairs. Sarah tells Rachel that Uncle Iddo decided to stay the night. And she hears Iddo singing the same lullaby he sang when he assaulted her at 8. He blames her for the assault and degrades her. The next night, Rachel goes to the barn to blow out a lantern for her father. Iddo waits for her inside and assaults Rachel again. She runs home and tells her father, but he blames and beats her. Rachel runs away to Grace's home. Grace is a friend of Rachel's friend, Nate, and he met Grace during his rumspringa. Grace will help Rachel find the voice to speak out for herself, her sister, and Amish women like her.<br/><br/>This movie should have a trigger warning for the first hour. Inspired by actual events, it starts with Rachel's assault at 8. Viewers will scream for Rachel to escape, but her indoctrination started at birth. She even reports herself for tempting Iddo. It will break your heart to see Rachel return. But it serves a purpose, so hang in there if you can get past the first hour.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"During a business meeting, Nick exposes a security glitch in his company's latest app. With brute force, a hacker can use the company's app to access any device connected to a user's Wi-Fi. Nick's boss, Lisa, isn't happy, because this flaw can be detrimental if they don't fix it before the release. Nick thinks he can find a way, but it will take time.<br/><br/>Lisa invites Nick for drinks to discuss the product launch. She wants Nick to be the new program manager. It means longer hours until the release. Afterward, Nick can set his hours, choose his team, and get a raise. Nick smiles because more time at home will help his wife, Jen. Nick took on more work when Jen gave birth to their daughter, Julianna. More time at home would help Jen restart her career.<br/><br/>At the launch party, Lisa gives Jen and Nick a toy bear for Julianna and introduces Nick as a genius. Jen starts to notice Lisa gets handsy with Nick. Later, Jen tells Nick that Lisa likes him, but Nick assures Jen that she is the only woman for him. Jen smiles, knowing her marriage is intact. But she is wrong. Lisa will hack, drug, and kill to get Nick. And not just for Nick but for what he offers: Julianna. Lisa wants to be a mom more than anything in the world. And the adoption agency turning her down left a damaged Lisa unhinged and ready to murder.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, stay until the end for the shocking twist of fate. Nick falls for every trick in the succubus handbook, and Lisa uses high-tech and low-tech manipulation to drive a wedge between them. Lisa intrudes on their lives using text messages, a watch, and a nanny cam. Nick is so clueless, and it's somewhat funny. For a moment, Jen holds him responsible for his actions but caves in the last 5 minutes. So don't cheer for her too soon.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Cozy Christmas Inn",
    "review":"Erika gets a call that her boss, Sharon, is in the building and coming to her office. Sharon asks Erika about Erika's professional Christmas list, and Erika jokes about becoming a Vice President. Sharon tells Erika that Erika's wish can be a reality if Erika helps Sharon get what she wants for Christmas. Then, Sharon hands Erika an InFlight magazine containing an article about Garland Inn. Sharon wants Erika to fly to Garland, Alaska, and purchase the Garland Inn. If Erika closes the deal, Sharon will make Erika a VP.<br/><br/>Erika dated a guy, Andy, but he moved to Garland to help with the family business, Holiday Shipping. Andy owns the inn. He sold his plane to cover the mortgage, but now the money is almost gone. Frank wants Andy to consider the offer and return to the family business. Erika and Andy will work together, and Erika will learn there is more to Garland and the Holiday family than meets the eye. However, the deal is a lose-lose situation. If Andy sells, he will lose his dream, but Erika will get the job. If Andy keeps the inn, Erika will lose her promotion.<br/><br/>Ok. The movie isn't bad, but it's typical. Now, holiday magic surrounds Frank's business, and Garland is in on it. The plot doesn't tell the viewer the secret but leaves enough hints to figure it out for yourself. The standouts are the townspeople, Sharon's one-liners, and Stephanie's naked truths.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Chloe updates her podcast listeners on her latest findings about the Bombshell Murders.

    "mtitle":"A Kismet Christmas",
    "review":"Sarah pretends to read an excerpt from her 2nd novel in the Isabella Kismet Cookies series. Her agent, Benny, tells the crowd of anxious tweens that Sarah selected the contest's winner. And the winner lives in her hometown of New Britain. Sarah isn't happy about going home to announce the winner, and Benny can see it on her face.<br/><br/>Years ago, Sarah made Kismet Cookies with her grandmother, Mia. They baked the cookies and gave them to people in need. But not for food, for love. Without Mia's knowledge, Sarah got a cookie and put it under her pillow. She dreamed of her best friend, Travis. Then ran to Travis's home to tell him and barged into his wedding. Sarah ripped up the recipe, left New Britain that day, and never returned. She wrote the first book, except the book's cookies make you into a superhero, not find true love.<br/><br/>Sarah arrives at Mia's home and gets a call from Benny. He reminds Sarah that she has until January 3rd to finish the book. In front of the town, Sarah announces that Jasmine is the winner. Jasmine runs on stage and hugs Sarah. Jasmine tells Sarah that her father is Santa and points to the Santa standing behind her. Santa smiles and calls Sarah by her childhood nickname because Santa is Travis. This time to write is colliding with Sarah's unresolved past. She keeps remembering her dream but puts that aside until Mia tells Sarah that Travis is divorced. Could Sarah's dream be true?<br/><br/>Based on The First Love Cookie Club by Lori Wilde, this movie follows the Hallmark setup. But it gets unintentionally scary. When Benny says the publisher wants to hire a ghostwriter, Travis drives Sarah to a cabin in the woods with no Wi-Fi and takes her phone. Lifetime fans will get a bad feeling for a moment, but then you remember it's Hallmark. This movie is a typical love story with Christmas, magic, and a cute kid.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
