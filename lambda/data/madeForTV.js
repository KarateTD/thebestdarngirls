    "review":"Laura gets off the bus with a book bag, dirty clothes, and a broken flip-flop. She hears a man, Tye, preaching to the homeless and watches. Tye tells Laura that in the past, her father abused her, and her mother allowed it. When Laura denies it, Tye says she refuses to remember.<br/><br/>Today, Laura and Tye have four children and one on the way. River loves to sing, and Meadow protects Laura. Rain is Tye's true believer, but Perry is the objector. Meadow jumps with joy because she will attend school with her siblings, but Tye warns them to be careful of the serpent. The serpent will trick them and keep them from the kingdom of heaven.<br/><br/>The kids go to school, and the students tease them for being dirty. Tye doesn't allow them to bathe and restricts their food. Meadow makes a friend, Andrea, and begs Laura to let the girl visit. Andrea goes into Laura and Tye's room and finds their TV. Meadow says the TV is demonic and a window to the serpent. Tye runs in, takes the remote, and tells Andrea to go home. He has decided the children will never go to school or leave the house. For ten years, Laura and Tye will have more children to mold, control, and torture. Social media will be their first step to freedom.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the Turpin Family, this movie will enrage anyone who watches. There will be plenty of trigger warnings throughout for viewers. Laura constantly ignores the cries of her children to please Tye. He instructs Laura to beat, chain, and restrain their children for days. Also, you will cry as Tye uses Perry as a scapegoat while favoring Rain and Meadow. If child abuse isn't enough to make you scream, cherry-picking the bible will make you furious. Viewers should not be angry with the children because they are prime examples of Stockholm Syndrome and trauma bonding. Tye created a cult within his home, and social workers, law enforcement, and neighbors should work together to save children like these.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Veronica is an ad executive for her family's 100-year-old cereal company with old fashion family values. Veronica comes home and talks about her day with Jordan. With his 30th birthday coming up, Jordan has a special request: a ménage à trois.<br/><br/>Veronica discusses Jordan's request with her trainer, Lexi. Veronica turns around and asks Lexi to join them. Afterward, Jordan says yes to Lexi being their third. They spend a passionate night together, but Veronica feels elated and shamed.<br/><br/>Veronica meets with Lexi for a session, but Veronica sees something is off. Veronica decides to fire Lexi as her trainer. Lexi gets in Veronica's face, makes a scene, and complains to her boss. Lexi's boss comes to Veronica and says that Lexi made sexual harassment claims. Veronica quits. As Veronica cleans her locker, Lexi says quitting isn't enough to keep her quiet about the love affair. She wants $50,000, or she will go public. Veronica knows that public allegations will end her job and William's brand. So she decides to pay. But Veronica will learn that Lexi wants more, including revenge.<br/><br/>This story is expansive, and Lifetimers can feel it. While you watch, you know there is more to the story because Lexi won't back off. She comes to corporate events, prays, and kidnaps to get what she wants. This plot feels like a vengeful lover, but the character is more complex. This film is as frightening as it is sexy.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Lauren died of a heart attack that morning, and they are having services for Lauren that week.

Mrs. Price believes someone murdered Lauren and positions Zoey in Lauren's dorm and around Lauren's friends to learn the truth. Zoey hangs her head and agrees to investigate. Zoey will put her life on the line to enter a world of deadly deception.<br/><br/>Kudos to Lifetime for putting on an enthralling mystery for its fans. Normally, Mrs. Price would be hounding the teachers, dean, and students to find out what happened to Lauren. The twist is Mrs. Price is blackmailing Lauren's best friend to do the work. Mrs. Price is the queen of delegating. This film is a movie meant for popcorn and tea.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gavin sits with his father, Vance, and talks about their latest acquisition, Crystal Cove, a shopping complex. All the stores are doing great, except one: Lather and Luxury. Vance wants to evict them, but Gavin convinces Vance to give the store more time. Gavin will use his trademark strategy to improve the store. If he fails, Vance will evict the store.<br/><br/>Gavin walks into Lather and Luxury and sees a familiar face; his ex-girlfriend, Skye. He offers to help her store, but she refuses because she thinks the store is doing ok. However, Skye's mother, Linda, begrudgingly speaks the truth. The store has been in a steady decline for years. Skye decides to take Gavin's assistance, but he doesn't tell her about the impending eviction. However, Skye tells Gavin that he has to learn about the products before he can offer input. Zoey and Gavin's brother, Cole, can see the sparks but will they last when Skye learns about the eviction?<br/><br/>Thank goodness for the comic relief of Zoey and Cole. They add moments of laughter to an unremarkable script. The actors tried their best, but it wasn't enough to inspire interest. Although hearing about the different scents and their properties is intriguing, its not enough to engage the viewer. When Cole and Zoey meet, you see the love and want more. This film won't be a favorite in the Fall in Love series.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
