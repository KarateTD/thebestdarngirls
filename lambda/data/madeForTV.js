    "mtitle": "Christmas at Plumhill Manor",
    "review": "Mr. Calvaux marvels as Margot convinces investors to tear down a historic site for luxury highrises. He celebrates her achievements at the company holiday party. Margot exits the party early and sifts through her holiday cards. She finds a comical one from her mother and calls her. Margot walks home during their phone conversation and runs into a man, James, in her building's lobby. James worked for her aunt Victoria. Victoria left her estate to Margot, her only living heir. Margot can decide to keep or sell it but must live in it for 7 days. He gives her a bottle of wine and a plane ticket for tomorrow. She peels the label and reveals a poem. She calls out of work and tells Mr. Calvaux about the manor.<br/><br/>Margot arrives at the airport and meets James. He introduces Margot to her liaison, Jackie. Jackie drives Margot to the manor, and Margot admires the construction. Margot sees the groundskeeper, Alfie, outside. Later, Jackie takes Margot to the local pub. Margot meets Alfie and tries his plum cider. She asks Alfie about it, but Alfie doesn't want to elaborate. He's seen Margot's history of demolishing old buildings and making trendy architecture. He assumes she will do the same thing to Plumhill Manor.<br/><br/>Jackie MCs a trivia game and puts Margot and Alfie on opposite teams. Jackie believes their time together can change Margot's heart towards the Manor and Alfie's feelings toward Margot. However, Mr. Calvaux can't wait to get his hands on the property to expand his company. Will Jackie's plan work before Mr. Calvaux convinces Margot to replace Plumhill Manor?<br/><br/>This movie follows the typical romance movie format. Margot excels at work but is unknowingly unhappy. Alfie is in love with the manor. He can't stomach the thought of destroying the building. They fall in love as they learn. Mr. Calvaux is not a viable threat, but taxes are. This movie is a solid start to the 2024 Lifetime Holiday Schedule, but it's not a favorite.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Asha mentions getting Samuel's blessing as they walk home, and Jake admits he didn't. So they create a tight schedule to visit each other's families during the holidays and get Samuel's blessing. Jake and his family will have a memorable Christmas with the Singhs, but will their relationship survive?<br/><br/>Samuel has no chill when it comes to his daughter. Jake started on the wrong foot with this family, and his parents don't help. Also, the families were competing for years and never knew it. Viewers' frustration will grow when Asha straddles a tightrope between her family and relationship. You hope she will stand up to them, but you must understand that she has cultural pressure. With the arguing, the script is humorous and quotable. Watch this one with the family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Woman with My Face",
    "review": "Writer Anya and her daughter, Mia, move after Anya loses her job and marriage. Anya settles into life and visits the library to search for article topics and references. She notices a man following her around and leaves. He catches up to her and calls her Sarah. Anya says her name isn't Sarah, and the man, Joseph, can't believe it. He shows Anya a picture of his wife, Sarah, and they look identical. Joseph introduces Anya to librarian Sarah, and it's unbelievable to them. Later, the test confirms that they are identical twins. Anya shares this information with a local news correspondent, Harper, but Sarah hates being on public display. After the interview, a reporter, Peter, bumps into Anya. She finds a note in her bag later. The note warns her to stay away from the investigation. Anya decides to ignore it, but that's a mistake. Someone has a deadly secret to hide, and they will kill to keep it.<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn with a compelling killer. However, the plot moves at a snail's pace and bores you before it gets to the exciting part. The lead actress did a great job separating Anya from Sarah. They had different mannerisms and voice inflections. The final reveal will surprise you if you keep watching. But the final fight is lackluster.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "'Tis the Season to Be Irish",
    "review": "Rose successfully finishes another flip. Her business partner wanted Rose to consider buying the home, but Rose never laid down roots. Her only constants are a storage unit and a box of items. Inside are photos of her mother's trip to Ireland. Rose's mother described Ireland as magical and wanted them to visit. But she died. Rose's partner starts looking up Ireland and sees several cottages for sale at a low price. Rose says it's a scam. She changes her mind when she sees a cottage for 10,000 euros. She calls the realtor, Sean, but he has another buyer. Later, Sean caves but warns Rose to read the fine print.<br/><br/>Rose arrives in Ireland and unknowingly runs into Sean. He offers her a ride, but she won't take the gesture from strangers. Rose approaches the cottage after Sean, and he laughs at her expense. She walks to the home, and her jaw drops. The photo on the website was several years old. She has to work with the historical society to ensure the house maintains Irish values. Rose takes a deep breath and asks to meet the head of the historical society. It's Sean. Sean won't make this flip easy. However, Rose finds something she could never buy: roots and love.<br/><br/>This film starts entertaining when Rose and Sean meet, but the plot slows as it adds more townspeople. The writers wanted Rose to make decisions based on everyone, not only love. However, these people aren't integral to the story. The plot should have focused on the comedy behind flipping the house.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
