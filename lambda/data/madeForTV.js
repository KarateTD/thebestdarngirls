    "review":"After the college defunded her scholarship, Cassie is looking for an alternative to stay in school. She walks past the Kappa Eta Lambda sorority exhibit and overhears the sorority offers housing and tuition assistance.  She approaches them for a flyer, but they tell her no.  Cassie walks away, but runs into a classmate named Lisa.  Lisa says 'no' was a test.  The Lambdas expect her to come back and ask again.  She goes back, and they give her a flyer.  Soon, Cassie is the newest Lambda, and Monica is assigned to be her big sister. When Wendy, the house mom, sees Cassie's interest in the social committee, she invites Cassie to the white party to meet with benefactors. When Cassie arrives at the sorority house, Wendy has astonishing news.  One of the benefactors liked her and wants to sponsor her.  Wendy wants Cassie to join the social committee.  Cassie's life on campus is debt-free, and in the house is chores free.  Cassie doesn't know the social committee is a front for prostitution.  After several sisters die, Cassie vows to put an end to it all.<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance.  With the setup, it's easy to dismiss it as background noise.  During the sting, it becomes a full-blown mystery, twice.  This movie will pleasantly surprise you with its compelling twist.  Cassie will blossom from a timid, naive girl to an intelligent, strong woman within two hours.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secrets in the Basement",
    "review":"Barbara found the home of Delilah and Shawn's dreams. Delilah sees all the markings of a basement but doesn't see one.  Barbara tells Delilah that she will double-check the plans and let her know if there is a basement.  During a trip to the hardware store, Delilah runs into Jay, the man who designed her home.  He is curious to see what she has done to the house.  Delilah allows Jay to follow her home.  During the tour, the two start to click, and Delilah wants to work for him.  After a few short moments, Jay agrees to allow Delilah to work with him. As work starts to mount, Delilah is collapsing under the pressure.  Delilah sees figures moving, unknown decor appearing, and cabinets opening on their own. As the old saying goes, just because you're crazy, it doesn't mean they aren't after you. Someone is out to get her, and they want her to pay for a huge mistake.<br/><br/>Secrets in the Basement isn't what you would expect from the title, but it does cover the Lifetime basics.  You have the over-trusting lead going crazy, the husband trying to help, and the nosy best friend that never disseminate all the necessary information at one time.  While the movie does try to add suspense for the person in the basement, experienced Lifetimers will be able to figure it out in 5 minutes.  The killer's motives are what drives viewers to watch.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
