  "mtitle":"Her Deadly Night in Paris",
  "review":"Lucy meets Antoine at the docks. He is the son of her host family. Antoine's mother, Madeleine, greets Lucy with open arms and playfully scorns Antoine for not carrying Lucy's bags. Lucy meets Antoine's father, Judge Remy, but he maintains some distance.<br/><br/>Lucy and Antoine meet outside school on Friday, and she plans to study. Antoine convinces her to have some fun on the weekend and go to a party. Antoine can't conceal his jealousy when Lucy swoons over DJ Vincent. Before Lucy can meet the DJ, Antoine sees Vincent's parole officer enter the club. Antoine grabs Lucy, and they stay in the closet all night and kiss.<br/><br/>Antoine drops Lucy off at his parents' house but leaves for his loft. Lucy walks up the driveway and sees a man arguing with Remy. Remy gets a knife and stabs him. Remy tells Lucy he was protecting himself, but self-defense is harder to prove to Paris police. He asks Lucy to open the back door, and he will hide the body. Lucy complies.<br/><br/>Lucy comes home after school to find Lt. Laurent in Remi and Madeleine's living room. Laurent informs Lucy that a man, Gaston, is dead, and Lucy's DNA is on his body. Laurent arrests Lucy and takes her to the station. Lucy realizes there is no way the French government has her DNA on file, and they can't make a match that fast. Remy is setting her up, and Laurent is helping him. With quick thinking, she is on the run with Antoine. They must clear Lucy's name before she loses her freedom, or worse, her life. This movie drags in the beginning, but the wait sets up the false narrative Lucy sees about her host family. As Lucy penetrates the fa√ßade, she sees Remy's controlling nature. Lucy isn't a damsel in distress waiting for someone to save her. She uses low-tech solutions, quick footwork, and intelligence to stay one step ahead. The journey is worth it, if you survive the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Trapped in the Cabin",
  "review":"Romance writer Rebecca drives to a remote cabin owned by her manager, Jason. She wanted to leave the press tour to write her next book. So, he offered to let Rebecca stay in his cabin for a few weeks. He warns Rebecca that the upstairs is in repair, but everything she needs is on the first floor. Also, the cell reception is spotty. Rebecca's mom, Ms. Collins, calls with a list of worries. Last month, someone broke into Rebecca's home and took her workout clothes. The police believe the stolen clothes to be a one-time prank.<br/><br/>Rebecca marvels at the lush cabin and its amenities while making herself comfortable. She settles in for the night and goes for a jog in the morning. Rebecca meets Nathan during her workout. Later, Rebecca prepares a bath, but the water is freezing. She texts Jason, and he sends a plumber immediately.<br/><br/>Nathan knocks at Rebecca's door and fixes the tub. Rebecca throws caution to the wind, kisses Nathan, and shares a passionate night with him. Rebecca wakes up from bliss to find Nathan gone and the house trashed. She furiously texts Nathan and calls out his rude behavior, but he doesn't answer. Rebecca decides to put it behind her and focus on work. But the person stalking her with security cameras won't let her. Can Rebecca escape the cabin alive?<br/><br/>This movie is old-school Lifetime at its finest. Rebecca's cabin checks all the boxes because it's remote, has poor reception, and it's in the middle of a snowstorm. When the plot reveals Rebecca's stalker halfway into the film, it ramps up the creep factor. The movie will have you yell at Rebecca in frustration one minute and yelling for her to survive the next. The script is a whirlwind of emotions that old-school Lifetimers crave.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Tim and Darius promise not to use the drone again.<br/><br/>Megan and Tim get closer with each excursion. Then, Amy arrives. Amy and Tim dated. Now, she's there to tell him she is his boss.

Will she lose faith in Tim and their relationship, or will the culprit come forward to clear Tim's name?<br/><br/>This film has everything you expect.
