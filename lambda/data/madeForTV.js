    "review":"Mia delivers an impassioned speech to her senior class during Maplewood Prep's Anti-Bullying Week. She suffered her first year because she wasn't rich like the other students. Her mother, Madelyn, got a job as a music teacher so Mia could attend. Josh asks Mia about attending the University of Northeast Florida in the fall. He got accepted and thought they could get to know each other before. Madelyn leaves her love interest, Scot, when she sees her ex-husband, Erik, exiting the auditorium. Erik rages about Madelyn driving a wedge between him and Mia. She informs Erik that Mia sets the boundaries, not her. Madelyn walks to her classroom when Scot finds her and ends their relationship.<br/><br/>Madelyn sits with her student, Zoey, and questions Zoey about her ongoing cyberbullying case. While it was disturbing, it brought her closer to her parents. Madelyn can't wait to snuggle under the covers with Mia and watch Gilmore Girls. However, Mia has plans with the 'Jet Set' and asks for a rain check. Madelyn obliges.<br/><br/>Mia returns home with exhilaration. Then, Mia gets a disgusting text message from an unknown number. She runs to Madelyn for comfort. Soon, Mia receives hundreds of texts from unknown numbers. And it's hurting her schoolwork, relationships, and spirit. At least she has Madelyn. Will they find Mia's cyberstalker before they end her life?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie is wild, and you must give it time to cook. The principal and police take Mia's concerns seriously, and it's refreshing. Mia takes steps to defend herself by blocking the numbers and getting a new phone with an unlisted number. But nothing helps. As her life falls apart, her bully's life rises. This film highlights the new phenomena of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy in the digital age. The plot slowly connects the audience to Mia and her descent into depression, isolation, and desperation over the harassment. That's when the conclusion gives you the gut punch: the cyberbully's monologue. This torment isn't the bully's first rodeo.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Deadly Threat to My Family",
    "review":"Reporters flank Serena as she exits the courthouse with her brother, Ryan. They interrogate her about The Builders of Ascension cult. Serena testified against the leader, Aleph, and he got 30 years in prison. The cult believed the world would end in five days. So they planned to take their life and rise to the next level.<br/><br/>Ryan brings Serena home to the arms of her adoring niece, Aria, and uneasy sister-in-law, Marielle. He offers Serena the guest house to give her much-needed privacy. Marielle worries about Serena's progress, but Ryan tells Marielle not to focus on the past.<br/><br/>Marielle, Serena, and Aria get into the car to take Aria to school and Serena to therapy. Marielle and Aria argue about Aria trying to impress new classmates. Serena warns Marielle to loosen the reigns on Aria, or someone will take Aria away. Marielle sees Serena's warning as a threat. Marielle should worry because a deadly threat creeps around her family, and she has 5 days to save them.<br/><br/>Can someone slap Ryan? You will come unglued every time he accuses Marielle of overreacting. This movie boils down to communication. If Serena told Ryan and Marielle about the cult's plans, everything would have been avoidable. The plot feels farfetched. However, NXIVM, Heaven's Gate, and Jonestowns prove this can happen. This movie won't be a favorite, but it's an entertaining distraction for two hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Our Mother's Secret Affair",
    "review":"Fran grabs a weapon to confront an intruder, Kasey. However, Kasey introduces herself as Fran's older sister. The police question Kasey as Fran's mother, Diana, and Diana's old co-worker, Troy, arrive. Diana explains that she and Troy had an affair. They called it off when his wife, Elle, discovered the truth. However, Diana became pregnant with Kasey. Since Elle couldn't have kids, Diana signed over her rights to Elle and Troy. Diana missed Kasey so much that she got pregnant with Fran by her husband.<br/><br/>Elle calls her mother, Gloria, in a frantic state. Elle's brother, Jake, wants to end Diana, but Gloria warns him to step back. He is on probation and could return to jail for the slightest mishap. Elle had a mental breakdown over Troy's affair, and caring for Kasey helped her through it. Gloria won't let Diana hurt Elle again. Gloria assures Jake that she has wheels in motion to handle Diana.<br/><br/>Across town, a woman gets a phone call as she stashes her cash and gun. The caller wants her to take care of two females. She agrees to do it and gets pictures of Diana and Fran in her email. The woman makes a profile named Lynda and will ingratiate herself to Fran. She plans to get into Diana's home and make Diana and Fran's deaths look like accidents. Will she succeed before Fran and Kasey connect?<br/><br/>Lifetimers must pull out a notepad to keep track of all the connections, dealings, and motives. With each new character, the script injects a new complexity. The writers risk the script with more sensationalism. The plot has so many moving parts it becomes a parody of itself. Honestly, Troy is the villain of this movie. His affair caused a ripple effect for decades.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
