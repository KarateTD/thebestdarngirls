While two men grab Memphis, one shoots Sasha in the shoulder.<br/><br/>Sasha wakes up, handcuffed to a hospital bed with detectives questioning her. Sasha says nothing and demands a lawyer. Five years later, Sasha calls her friend, Jewel, from jail to confirm Sasha's release pick-up. Jewel can't make it, but she asked an old friend, Malik, to do it. Malik turns on the charm, but Sasha rejects him. Sasha is not over Memphis. Sasha learned Memphis died while she was in prison.<br/><br/>Sasha and Jewel reconnect, and Jewel offers Sasha a place to stay, clothes, and a car. However, Jewel doesn't tell Sasha the presents are from Malik. Malik comes to Sasha's job and succeeds by getting a date with her. Sasha thinks she has her life on track, but Malik hides a dark side.<br/><br/>Based on Lawainna Patterson's play, Bid for Love displays one woman's trip through self-discovery.

Melissa didn't know Kevin got a new job. Melissa goes to work and talks to her co-workers, Mary Ann and Cameron, about her problems at home.<br/><br/>At night, Kevin isn't home, and Melissa hears a noise from the kitchen. She walks downstairs to investigate and finds a strange man cutting an apple. The man tells Melissa that Kevin owes $15,000, and the man wants his money as soon as possible. After a few threats, the man leaves. Melissa confronts Kevin.

Kevin is the perfect villainous victim. To make this film more intriguing, it has plenty of OMG moments to make you perk up. So don't let the setup make you give up on this plot. It's worth it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Eva stands in her driveway, going through a box of her late husband's things. Then someone jumps out and grabs her. Her daughters, Sami and Grace, run out of their house and towards Eva's muffled screams but find no one there. Eva's mother-in-law, Nancy, takes care of Grace and Sami while Sami makes 'missing person' flyers. Nancy thinks Eva killed her son, Ryan. After a week with no word, Sami finds Eva lying on the sidewalk in a diabetic coma.<br/><br/>One year later, Eva has her life on track and a new job, but she will need to move to New York. Nancy thinks Eva is running from a guilty conscience, and Eva kicks Nancy out of the house. In the morning, Eva is gone.

Detective Campbell promises to look into Sami's concerns after 48 hours, but Sami refuses to wait for Detective Campbell and recruits her friend, Gabe. Sami vows to find out who kidnapped Eva for the 2nd time.<br/><br/>To quote Samuel L. Jackson, hold on to your butts because this movie will take you on a wild ride. The story keeps viewers guessing with secret meetings, money hand-offs, secret rooms, and a sketchy death. Sami starts as the typical Lifetime spoiled brat, but she redeems herself quickly. Within 30 minutes, you will cheer for Sami and her bad attitude.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Romance Wedding",
    "review":"Years after opening her wedding business with Nick, Zoe feels drained. Zoe wants to take time off but doesn't feel like she can. Til she gets a call from her mom, Celeste. Zoe's dad, Richard, broke his leg working in the garden, so he can't cook for their café. Zoe offers to come back to Romance, Oregon, and help.<br/><br/>When she arrives, Celeste tells Zoe the truth. They don't need her at the café because they already have her ex-boyfriend, Will, cooking. She drives to her parents' home and stops at Mason Farm. Zoe notices the 'For Sale' sign and gets an idea. She wants to buy the farm and turn it into a wedding venue. She tells Will, and he says, 'absolutely not.' Mason Farm belongs to his parents. If he doesn't sell the farm soon, he will have to use his savings to cover the payments. Without his nest egg, he can't start his dream restaurant. Also, he thinks farmland should stay farmland and nothing else. Will agrees if the mayor says yes, he will sell. However, Will knows it won't go through because the mayor feels like him. Zoe won't back down and will rally the town of Romance in her favor to restart her business.<br/><br/>Yes, the ending is predictable, but the plot has several layers. It's a lot to keep up with while you drool over roasted root veggies with honey and mint, banana cream pie with homemade vanilla extract, and caramel salted brownies. While this won't be a favorite of the June Grooms season, give this movie a chance. It has entertainment value and great one-liners.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Helen drives to pick up her daughter, Lauren, for winter break. While on the phone with Lauren's school to iron out financial issues, Helen almost hits a woman on the road. The woman, Carly, says she was desperate to get someone to stop for her. Carly needs a ride to town to meet with her family. Carly agrees and gets in Helen's car. Carly opens the glove box and spots a gun. Helen says it's for self-defense, and Carly quietly nods. Carly tries not to show Helen that she is freaking out over the gun, but Carly texts her boyfriend, Boyd, the truth. Carly wants to stop their plan, but Boyd says no.<br/><br/>Carly waits for Boyd to attack when Helen picks up Lauren, but he doesn't, and the women drive to their next stop. Carly doesn't know, but a trucker blocked Boyd's car before he could attack. Carly texts Boyd again, but the trucker messages back that Boyd is dead and she is next. Helen and Lauren ride with the vengeful trucker's next victim. And he won't hesitate to make Lauren and Helen collateral damage.<br/><br/>A lot of suspenseful events driven by stupid decisions are the best way to summarize this movie. At first, viewers will believe that Boyd and Carly are the killers, but they are the least of Helen and Lauren's worries. As he hunts down the couple, you don't sympathize with them. Also, you will have little empathy for Helen because she keeps making countless mistakes. Lauren is the only person using their brain. This movie is frustratingly captivating.<br/><br/>3 out of stars.",

Liam and the groom, Brett, have been friends for years. At the mixer, Miranda and Brett introduce Liam to the maid of honor, Emma. They know Emma and Liam had one date that didn't go well, but they hope the two can get along for the wedding. Liam and Emma agree to put the past behind them and get along for the wedding.<br/><br/>With six weeks until the wedding, Miranda and Brett get called to their job site for an emergency. They don't want to postpone the wedding because it falls on their 5th anniversary. So they ask Liam and Emma to be their stand-ins and plan the wedding for them. Miranda and Brett want their wedding to be a surprise. Liam and Emma work together to create Miranda and Brett's dream wedding while falling in love.<br/><br/>While the actors try their best, this movie is slow and uninteresting. Predictable movies should be funny, dramatic, or heart-wrenching to keep your attention. However, this film doesn't accomplish any of those goals. Leave this film as background noise for a busy day.<br/><br/>1.5 out of stars.",

Devastated, Josh sits on a bench attempting to figure out what went wrong.<br/><br/>Hannah looks at herself in a wedding dress, and her sister, CeeCee, walks into the room with some unfortunate news. Her fiancé, Marcus, decided to call off the wedding. Too embarrassed to face her family, Hannah climbs out the window and walks to the bench.<br/><br/>Josh and Hannah converse and realize they got dumped at the alter on the same day. Hannah tells Josh how much she was looking forward to the Oahu honeymoon. He advises her to go without Marcus. Hannah asks Josh about his honeymoon plans, and Josh admits to having none. Hannah challenges Josh to take the first flight out and go on his honeymoon. They shake on it and leave.<br/><br/>Hannah goes through her checklist at the terminal to keep herself on task and sees Josh approaching. Later, Hannah checks into the hotel and sees Josh in the lobby. Hannah believes this is a coincidence, but the concierge, Kailani, thinks there is something more. After a few uncomfortable run-ins with honeymooners and each other, Josh and Hannah pair up to enjoy the island together.<br/><br/>Funny beyond words is the only way to describe this movie. You will laugh out loud and double over multiple times as Hannah says and does the most outrageous things at the best time. And let's not forget our new favorite couple, Cal and Nick. They hold nothing back and say everything you are thinking out loud. Sit back and be ready to have a good time.<br/><br/>5 out of stars.",
