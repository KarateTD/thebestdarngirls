    "mtitle":"Stolen Baby: The Murder of Heidi Broussard",
    "review":"Heidi helps her son, Aiden, brush his teeth, grabs her 2-week-old daughter, Emma, and takes Aiden to school. She comes home and calls her fiancé, Cody. He reminds Heidi to sleep when the baby sleeps. Heidi puts Emma down for a nap, gets into bed, and then her phone rings. Magen is outside in tears. Magen fought with the father of her child, Greg, and now needs to talk. Heidi gets Emma and meets Magen at Magen's car. Heidi and Emma get into the backseat, and they drive away.<br/><br/>Magen gets a call from Cody but ignores it to focus on her daughter. After a few days, Magen receives a call from Heidi's sister, Lilian. Heidi and Emma are missing, and no one can find them. Magen asks if the police investigated Cody because he and Heidi have issues. Magen encourages Lilian to be brave and hangs up. Greg walks into the room to hold Lily but notices she looks yellow. He wants Magen to take Lily to the doctor, but Magen angrily refuses. He relents and leaves. Greg thinks Magen is stressed. Sadly, he's right.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this movie is a display of long-festering envy. Magen and Heidi were so-called friends for decades, but everyone can see that Magen doesn't have a life outside of Heidi. Viewers will squirm as police suspect Cody. But Cody endures this and gives the police a hint by recalling the day of Emma's birth. You will weep for Heidi's family. Her parents, sister, and friends desperately look for her while maintaining some sense of 'normal' for Heidi's son. Also, any parent will ache for baby Emma. She is sick and needs medical care, but Magen's selfishness and fear won't let her see Emma's illness. While you watch, don't forget their is another victim: Greg. Greg thought he had a beautiful baby girl and genuinely cared for her. Magen's lies took that all away. This movie has several flashbacks, but it draws viewers into the film. With amazing acting and great story-telling, this movie will make you take a double look at who you call a friend.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"David walks to Linda after she graduates from the police academy. Linda joins David's precinct but becomes increasingly disinterested in the mundane cases. Linda stands outside David's office and eavesdrops on David's conversation with FBI Agent Neil. David wrote several letters to the FBI for assistance, and the FBI sent their rookie agent to tell David to stop. During their conversation, an officer reports another murder with the same signature. Now, they have enough victims to flag it as a serial killer.<br/><br/>Neil and David discuss the next steps for catching the killer, and Neil suggests putting someone undercover. David says his men don't have the training, but Linda enters the room. She reminds David that she looks like all the victims and that the office underutilizes her. Before David can reject Linda again, Neil agrees with her. Then, David lays down the ground rules. First, Linda can't go anywhere without her gun because the killer uses a hammer to murder his victims. Linda has to wear a wire. Finally, Linda can't get into anyone's vehicle. Linda promises to adhere to the rules and eagerly goes undercover. Can Linda catch the killer without losing herself?<br/><br/>This movie, set in the 1980s, relies heavily on police work because DNA testing was in its infancy. Sadly, the film reminds viewers that the ideas about prostitutes and their profession haven't changed. Also, Linda makes blaring mistakes. But remember, she is a rookie. This film emphasizes the taboo of sex work, the dark mind, and the advancement of DNA testing.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
