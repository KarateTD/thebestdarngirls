    "review": "Val and her husband, Ross, barbecue for their friends and family. Their daughter, Kayla, is expecting her first child with her husband, Mica. And their son, Jeremiah, will soon start college. Val can't wait to be an empty nester. But tonight, she and Ross will be alone to celebrate their anniversary. However, Ross would rather work on his car than be with her. Val cries.<br/><br/>After Val and Ross drop Jeremiah off at college, they reminisce in the car while listening to Mary J. Blige. She mentions that they haven't had an intimate connection in months. It leads to an arguement, nearly causing a crash. Val meets with her friends, and they suspect that Ross is going through male menopause. They recommend counseling. When Val offers this solution, Ross tells her to go alone. She decides to leave Ross in North Carolina and move in with Kayla in New Orleans. She can discover what it means to find herself and be happy. But will she uncover more?<br/><br/>Inspired by Be Happy by Mary J. Blige, this film isn't about drama, murder, or fighting. It's about a woman finding and demanding the love she wants and deserves. The writers had Val go through self-discovery to find happiness within herself first. The film utilizes New Orleans' food, music, and art to infuse warmth and history into the narrative. The conflict isn't between two men. It's between who Val is becoming versus what Val was. Ross and her new love interest, Peter, represent that tug-of-war. Both men are flawed, confusing Val as she moves between the two. This picture is the definition of grown and sexy.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Kris's second-in-command, Brandy, alarms Kris that their most important client has arrived early. Kris panics as she rushes to the conference room. However, her husband, Richie, sits and laughs, while Brandy slinks out of the room. Richie quit his job and wants to move to Portland. Kris wants to think about it, and they can iron out the details at home. Later, Kris arrives at home and finds a pot burning on the stove, a broken picture, and Richie's body. Someone shot and killed him. Detective West sits Kris down and asks questions.<br/><br/>To everyone's surprise, Kris arrives at work to take her mind off Richie's murder. Brandy informs her that a woman named Cassie is waiting for her in the lobby. Kris greets Cassie and learns that she is Richie's sister. She tells Kris that Richie wasn't a good man. He asked for money to invest, and he left them with nothing. This revelation is strange to Kris because Richie had nothing when they moved into their home, only luggage and a clock. Kris goes home and uncovers that the clock is a safe. She opens it and finds an ID with Richie's face and another address. She drives to the location, and Jennifer answers with her bodyguard, Clyde. Jennifer looks at the ID and recognizes the man as her husband, Richie. Kris is unsure what to do until Detective West suspects her. She teams up with Jennifer to reveal the man behind the lies. Can they clear Kris's name before Detective West takes her away in handcuffs?<br/><br/>This film's pacing is too slow, making it difficult to get to the point and boring the audience. It's refreshing to see the women work together instead of name-calling, fighting, or defending Richie. They quickly understand that he is the problem, and they were victims of his manipulation. The writers scripted a charming back-and-forth with exceptional insight. The reveal is dramatic, and the motive is compelling. However, it goes by so fast that you may miss it. This film is for the busy Lifetimer who can afford to skip the middle.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Parker's sister, Emily, wants him to unplug and enjoy their luxury cruise. However, he can't relax because this trip is for business. His company wants to acquire the luxury liner, adding it to its portfolio. Parker's boss, Adam, finds him on the ship and asks for an update. Adam brought his laptop, to Emily's chagrin, and will check the numbers before the presentation. Emily begs him to walk around the deck. He plans to, but only to check for precautions.<br/><br/>Kelly unpacks in her room while talking to her boss, George. Kelly must go incognito as a guest and report if the cruise liner is a good investment. George wants her to leave the analog behind and put her findings in an app. Kelly hangs up and walks on the deck for fresh air when she sees Parker checking the lifeboats. He was an actuary and now wants to ensure the ship's safety. After a few dad jokes, Kelly exits with a smile.<br/><br/>Kelly and Emily arrive at dinner and discover they are alone at the singles table. Emily wonders if their are single men on the trip. Kelly admits that she's met one who's a bit odd. She points out Parker, and Emily laughs. He joins them. Then, he pulls out his laptop, and Kelly sees that he's working for the company that she's spying on. Emily convinced Parker to leave the ship and venture out on a waterfall excursion. Kelly also planned on exploring it. So, they invite Kelly to join them.<br/><br/>As they exit the ship, the captain announces that everyone must return to the port on time. They won't wait for anyone. Kelly and Parker eat lunch before arriving to meet their guide. They show up late, and the guide only has donkeys for them to take up the mountain. They enjoy a smooth ride, disembark their donkeys, and take photos by the waterfall. They turn to exit, and the donkeys are gone. After a valiant effort, they miss the boat. They must get back. Parker needs to make his presentation, and Emily must report to work. Without it, they could lose their jobs. Can they make it back in time?<br/><br/>This film takes this pair on a couple's therapist's dream project over a few days. The plot pits them against scammers, strikers, and hospitality staff. Each step tries their patience, but they lean on each other. The writers had the pair deal with their setbacks and struggles in a mature manner. The Italian scenery does make an appearance in this film, but it's not the focal point. Movies like The Godfather and Star Wars have a stronger presence in the show. The captivating question is when and how Parker will uncover Kelly's job. And the ending delivers a second couple in the making. Hallmarkies should watch this film if they need a laugh, but not before they go on a cruise.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jenna and Grant unpack and settle into their new home. Grant reminds Jenna that his boss, Matt, wants to be the first dinner guest. Matt brings his wife Rainy, who can't believe how much Jenna looks like Grant's deceased first wife. Jenna never knew Grant was married. Matt reveals that Grant is a magnificent pianist, which is more information Jenna didn't know. During the dinner, Matt and Jenna have a heated argument about ethics in the legal profession. Jenna apologizes to Grant, and he forgives her. Rainy drunkenly stumbles into the car, noting how she looks exactly like Grant's ex-wife. Jenny can't hide her rage after Matt and Rainy leave. Grant hid a significant part of his life from her, and she can't sleep next to a stranger. She tells him to sleep on the couch.<br/><br/>Jenna wakes to find that Grant isn't there. He left early for work and didn't want to bother her because she had been upset previously. Jenna's curiosity gets the better of her, and she looks up Grant's first wife online. Then, someone calls and threatens her to stop digging. After a business meeting, Jenna receives a knock on her door. It's a piano delivery. Jenna is clueless about the package, and Grant tells her to reject it. Later, Detective Diane rings Jenna's doorbell. Diane questions Jenna about their dinner date with Matt and Rainy. Jenna tells Diane about Grant's secrets, the argument, and the threatening phone call. It piques Diane's interest because someone murdered Rainy, and Grant is now their number one suspect. Jenna's world is upside down, and she has no one to trust. Can she find the truth before the killer comes after her?<br/><br/>This film goes from wild to outlandish to crazy over the course of two hours. It combines 3 cliché Lifetime plots into one movie. However, it remains entertaining. Also, Jenna's father is one of the best written comic reliefs on Lifetime. He has platinum dad jokes, great one-liners, and a comedic edge. The killer has the strangest motive. However, the storyline has been so eccentric that you just accept it. Viewers should watch this film when they need a good laugh with a zany plot.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
