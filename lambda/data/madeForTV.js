    "review": "Rena gardens and listens to music when a tap on her shoulder startles her. Her husband, John, tells Rena to come inside quickly. The news reports about the LeBaron Mormon sect. During a deadly ambush, several people lost their lives, and scores were injured. Then, they hear someone pulling into the driveway. Rena instinctively hides while John answers the door. It's a reporter, Josie. Her investigation revealed that Rena was the ex-wife of Ervil LeBaron, the leader. Josie understands Rena's reservations because she grew up in a polygamist group too.<br/><br/>Rena gathers her courage and allows Josie inside. Josie wants to interview Rena about her life in the sect and how Rena escaped. She is willing to talk to Josie, but she has ground rules. Josie isn't allowed to take photos, write about John, mention their address, or record the interview. Josie agrees to Rena's stipulations. Josie sits with her pen and paper in hand and asks Josie about her family, the cult, child brides, assaults, and murder.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this movie starts with a necessary trigger warning. The writers used the interview to allow Josie to ask the questions you have. Rena explains her past decisions while understanding the clarity of hindsight. It's unfathomable that this story is real. The costume, hair, and makeup department studied the cult's clothing. And the set designers paid close attention to the family's living conditions. The actors did an astounding job displaying fear, trauma, and blind devotion. Watch this film if you can handle the triggers. Viewers will wait with bated breath for part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Olivia took over her brother's job after he died in an accident. Her father, Gerald, encourages Olivia to spend time with her friends from work - Kelly and Liam. Olivia agrees to ease Gerald's mind.<br/><br/>Olivia's ex-boyfriend, Patrick, stops her outside the bar to beg Olivia for a second chance. She ignores his pleas and meets Kelly inside. While Olivia ponders Patrick's remarks, a man named Jonathan orders the same drink she did. Olivia discovers that Jonathan comes from a wealthy family and is involved in charitable work. She thinks he's found the man of her dreams. However, Jonathan is a nightmare that will bring her world crumbling down.<br/><br/>This movie is slow, uneventful, and tiresome. The plot has an extremely low body count, leaves all the action until the end, and makes Olivia look foolish. This film is similar to the fake Rockefeller story but less interesting. Lifetimers should skip this film.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Philanthropist Nicole is uncomfortable accepting an award for her charitable work when the police haven't found Connor's killer. Nicole's mother, Mallory, assures Nicole that Connor would want her to move on and enjoy the moment. Nicole's husband, Connor's cousin Jack, confirms Mallory's sentiments. The police enter during Jack's speech and arrest Nicole for Connor's murder.<br/><br/>Five years after a jury found Nicole guilty, the police found evidence to prove she was innocent. Since then, Jack filed for full custody of their daughter, Sarah, divorced Nicole, and then started a relationship with Gwen. Scott informs Nicole that the police have reopened Connor's case and will keep her updated.<br/><br/>Gwen and Jack discuss the business, but she has a question gnawing at her. She asks Jack if he will allow Nicole to see Sarah since the police declared her innocent. He is unsure of the lasting effects prison had on Nicole.<br/><br/>Nicole walks outside her mother's home for fresh air. Upon re-entering, Nicole finds a note. It warns her that someone in Jack's inner circle knows something about Connor's slaying. Later, Connor's ex-wife, Kristen, admits to leaving the note. She divorced Connor because he had an affair with Gwen. Kristen and Connor tried to work things out, which angered Gwen. She believes Gwen killed Connor for revenge. Nicole's panic rises as she worries about Sarah's safety. Nicole must convince Jack that Gwen is dangerous, but will he believe her?<br/><br/>This movie begins as a mystery, but various flashbacks end the enigma. The setup for a wrongfully imprisoned woman happens quickly and grabs your attention. However, the conclusion follows the Lifetime guidelines. The only saving grace is the mature and loving relationship between the mothers and daughters. This film is like a rocket. It burns bright on the ascent but fizzles out at the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Bestselling Kind of Love",
    "review": "Author Sophie celebrates with her mother, Evelyn, when her first independent book is the #3 bestseller. Sophie's talent agent, Janice, calls Sophie to celebrate with a visit to her office. Sophie arrives, and Janice has plans to promote the book. However, Janice knows Sophie has a fear of public speaking. So, she hired a coach, Daniel, to guide Sophie. Daniel is Janice's client, and he's creating a web series about his methods. Janice offers Sophie's writing expertise for Daniel's work. Both reject the offer. Janice relents and tells Sophie that she scheduled an impromptu news conference earlier. Sophie freezes on the first question as Janice and Daniel watch.<br/><br/>Sophie prepares dinner with Evelyn, who encourages Sophie to take Daniel's offer. She calls, and Daniel asks for an informal lunch. He has a 5-step program to help her overcome her fear, but she can't ignore his. He has a fear of writing, and it's hindering his series. Daniel and Sophie shake hands. Love is in the air until Daniel's friend, Tom, wants to add Sophie to the web series secretly. Can their budding romance survive when Sophie learns her fears will be the series' focus?<br/><br/>This film is bland. Seeing someone overcome fears should spark emotions in any viewer, but this plot falls flat. The script gives the audience a story centered on a public speaking coach. It could include other clients to add more depth and comedy to the film. Don't be surprised if you watch this movie in the background while scrolling on your phone.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Gallery Manager Ava examines the pieces with her boss, Eugene. He notices that she is uninspired and more nonchalant than expected. Eugene suggests she take her honeymoon. Ava dismisses the idea because her former fiancé left her 1 week before their wedding. Eugene reminds Ava that her tickets for the Emerald Cruise will expire soon. Ava books the trip.<br/><br/>Duke József discusses the art in his family's parlor with his valet, Reynolds. He believes they should share the hidden artwork with the public. József's father, King Karl, demands to see his son. Karl reminds József that he is the future heir to the throne. He wants József to deliberate on the title before Karl announces it to the kingdom. Reynolds suggests József take a Danube cruise. It will sail past other castles, allowing József to connect with dignitaries and observe the artwork. József agrees.<br/><br/>Before Ava can check in with Teddy, a bag handler drops a pile of luggage. So Teddy gives Ava her iPad and helps the handler. József sees Ava with the tablet and assumes she works for the ship. She doesn't correct his assumption until they meet at the captain's table for dinner later that evening. József introduces himself to her as Joe and hides his royal status. He hopes to keep his status a secret while touring the castles of the Danube with her. His plans fall apart as he falls in love with her, seeing her passion for art. Will she be able to look past his deception while he finds his place on the throne?<br/><br/>This second installment of the Love on the Danube series is the standard tale of hidden royalty. With an inevitable conclusion, a Hallmark script demands more to keep the audience engaged. The characters show more passion for the art than for each other. You will find Betty, making a 2nd appearance, to be a delight. The spark between her and Reynolds is what the main cast is missing. Betty is your reason to watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
