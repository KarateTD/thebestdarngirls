    "review":"Jules runs from her husband, Billy, and hides in the bedroom. She has bruises on her wrist and blood dripping from her forehead. Billy's furious that Jules filed for divorce. He promises not to let her leave, and the fire alarm goes off. Billy dies in the fire.<br/><br/>Six months later, Jules's contractor, Kenny, rebuilds the home in Jules's image. Jules runs an art school, sees her therapist, Ron, biweekly, and works out with her best friend, Dana. Jules has nightmares about Billy but has coping mechanisms to subdue the terror. Before class, a student, Paul, helps set up and asks Jules out on a date. Jules considers it until she looks out the window and sees Billy. Jules looks again, but Billy is gone, and she turns Paul down.<br/><br/>Before Jules can relax, Detectives Walker and Young rudely enter Jules's home. Walker and Young believe Jules killed Billy, but Jules isn't surprised. Jules's neighbor, Naomi, comes with food, and Young pulls a gun on her. So Jules kicks the detectives out of her home. Naomi encourages Jules to go out with Paul, and Jules texts Paul, 'Yes.'<br/><br/>Paul and Jules go on a date and eat street-side tacos. Then she sees Billy in the distance and jumps. Paul agrees but suggests Jules takes a self-defense class to regain her sense of safety. Jules falls asleep dreaming of kissing Paul but wakes up after having a nightmare about Billy stabbing her. She wakes with bruises on her arm and has a panic attack. She texts Ron for a session at dawn, but Ron wants to run in the morning. So he asks Jules to come to his office at 9 am.<br/><br/>Jules enters Ron's office complex and learns he was in a hit-and-run accident. Detective Walker asks Jules for her whereabouts during Ron's accident. Furious, Jules retreats because the detective suspects she killed Ron. Nevertheless, Jules knows the person who killed Ron is Billy. Now, she has to make everyone believe he is alive and trying to finish the job.<br/><br/>If you are an experienced Lifetimer, the beginning will feel like the end. However, the start of the movie is the origin. The plot feels like a simple abuse and revenge story, but the storyline has much more to offer. Billy was upset about the impending divorce and was abusive, but the implications of the divorce set Billy off. The final scene puts a nail in Billy's coffin. While this movie is entertaining, it offers therapy and self-defense techniques. So watch with a pen and pad.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emily finishes a successful marriage counseling session with her estranged husband, Kyle. Since her parents' death, Emily wonders if she ever made decisions for herself or to please them. During a meeting, Emily informs her employees that she will complete a valued partnership her parents started before their death. Kyle clears his throat and asks why Emily didn't include him in the decision. She tells Kyle that the meeting is her way of incorporating him.<br/><br/>Emily drives home with her daughter, Nina, and almost hits a woman, Lily, in her driveway. Lily states that she came for the nanny position. Kyle comes to Emily's house and feels excluded from the decision to hire a nanny too. He wishes Emily had let him find someone if she wanted help with childcare. He doesn't trust Lily. Lily jumps into the conversation and admits she has a reason to be there. She is Emily's sister. Lily produces her birth certificate as proof. Emily tells Lily they can discuss it after Lily takes a DNA test, and Lily agrees. Emily travels to her parents' old storage unit to look through their things. Then, someone attacks her, but she fights the perpetrator off.<br/><br/>Emily and Lily spend more time together, waiting for the results. Kyle barges into the backyard with proof. He intercepted the DNA letter, and it says Emily and Lily aren't sisters. Lily swears she isn't lying, but Emily tells Lily to leave. She invites Kyle to return to their home and into her bed. Cassie calls Emily, but Emily's phone chimes with a low-battery alert. Emily looks for a charging cable but finds a letter from the DNA office. This document says Emily and Lily are sisters. Emily rages and demands an explanation. Kyle says Lily is a liar and a wedge in their marriage. He falsified the document, but it was to save Emily from Lily's manipulation and influence. Emily informs Lily they are sisters and wants to spend more time with her. Sadly Lily has to go because she is out of money. Emily offers Lily a job and a place to stay. Emily decides to relax in her hot tub to soak away the day. However, she ends up with paramedics checking her vitals because a wire in the bottom of the tub electrocuted her. Someone is out to hurt Emily physically, emotionally, and financially. And Emily has to get to the bottom of it before she loses everything.<br/><br/>Emily skips 95% of Lifetime mistakes by requesting a DNA test and a birth certificate in the first 10 minutes. Viewers will be in the dark for most of the movie. And that's by design, but the audience can't ignore obvious plot holes in the film. The final monologue brings a slew of lies, transgressions, and jealousy, so keep watching. Emily will lose bonds to gain herself.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Faith wakes up after having another nightmare. Faith's husband, Bryce, tells Faith to take her medication, but it makes her sluggish. She goes to the bathroom and drops the pills down the drain.<br/><br/>Faith prepares breakfast for Bryce and their daughter, Jada. Faith sees a news report on the TV and asks Bryce to turn it up. The report talks about General Dupree and the murder of the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. Faith thinks General Dupree looks familiar. Then, Bryce turns off the TV to get attention from Faith.<br/><br/>Faith runs a high-end shoe store off the freeway. After locking up, Faith goes to the back of the store to get her car, and several men with guns jump out of the darkness. Faith turns around, grabs the gun, and kills all the men. She doesn't remember training but sees visions of herself as a soldier. She runs down the alley for help but gets hit by a car. A man grabs Faith and puts her in his trunk.<br/><br/>Bryce makes his way to the police station and demands help. Then Bryce mentions the location of her store. The attending officer yells for detectives to question Bryce about the murders. The detectives show Bryce a video of Faith taking down several men before being hit by a car and kidnapped. Bryce answers their questions and returns home. He opens a secret compartment and exposes a private computer room. He hacks into the police server and deletes the back alley video footage from evidence. Bryce must get Faith back to stabilize her. If not, she may have a total recall of Imani and go full metal jacket on the operation.<br/><br/>This movie starts by leaving the viewers as confused as Faith. The viewer sees the truth as the script follows Bryce, Supreme, and the General. They all have a hand in keeping Faith in the dark about Imani. However, viewers get the final reveal as Faith meets the mastermind face to face. The fight scenes are well-choreographed, but the editing isn't smooth. At times, the backing track drowns out pivotal conversations. <br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Birdie Case is a lawyer at her mother's practice. Her mother, Eleonore, wants Birdie to be a partner, but Birdie doesn't have the killer instinct Eleonore desires to head the law firm. Birdie's co-workers, Tim and Kyle, celebrate Birdie for being fair to her clients and the opposition. Birdie likes Tim despite him being on his mother's shortlist to make law partner. Kyle is Birdie's work husband. However, Birdie comes home to her actual husband, Alden Case. After countless jobs, Alden attends night school to become a CPA.

Birdie tells Alden, and they come to the same conclusion. They think Kyle killed Tim, but they must find out why and gather the evidence.<br/><br/>Unlike other H.M.M. mysteries, Alden and Birdie are a couple. This mystery reaches a broader audience because the main couple has real-world struggles. Birdie hides her gambling and divorce papers. And Alden doesn't talk about his P.I. classes. This case and working together forces them to be honest about their issues and open up about their vulnerabilities. This film packs plenty of humor and charm into one script. It will be your new favorite.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
