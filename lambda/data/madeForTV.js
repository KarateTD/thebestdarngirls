  "mtitle":"A Lifelong Love",
  "review":"Annika looks towards her grandfather, Abe, for encouragement before her pitch meeting with Rory at Lighthouse Publishing. She posted her poetry online and hoped to create an anthology of her new, past, and unreleased works for years. During their conversation, Abe admits to falling in love before dating Annika's grandmother. While in high school, Abe met an intelligent and beautiful cheerleader named Ruth. When Abe got back from the war, she married someone else. Abe heard that Ruth is a widow now, but no one knows her location. Annika wants to help Abe find Ruth after her meeting.<br/><br/>Annika explains her book to Rory, but he doesn't like it. She leaves disappointed and runs into Ryan in the hallway. Annika and Ryan dated in college but broke up after she turned down his proposal. They update each other on their lives, and Annika tells Ryan about Abe's search for Ruth.<br/><br/>During Rory's meeting with Ryan, Annika barges in and demands to know why Rory doesn't like her pitch. Annika doesn't have Ryan's following, and her idea won't sell, but Rory doesn't want to do a coffee table book of Ryan's photos either. Then Ryan mentions Abe's search for Ruth, and it captivates Rory. He wants them to write poems about love and photograph the subjects. And the final entry will be Abe and Ruth finding each other. And they have two weeks to get it done. Can Ryan and Annika find Abe's Ruth without drudging up their past? Or will Annika's perfection clash with Ryan's carefree attitude again?<br/><br/>The basis of the story is profound and sweet. However, your need for Annika and Ryan to find Ruth will pull you from the stories and lessons of love. So viewers can expect 30 minutes of build-up. Then, a slow-paced plot to a 10-minute conclusion with the main characters' relationship potentially ending before it starts. Thank goodness for a savvy tween and a charming grandpa to keep a smile on your face. This film is for you if you want to hear some love stories. Otherwise, keep this on the DVR for a rainy day.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Mariela has a passion for languages. She is leaving Venezuela for America to work as an au pair and immerse herself in the language and culture. Her sister, Ana, teaches English, but Mariela believes moving is the best learning tool.<br/><br/>Mariela gets a warm welcome from Lori, Lori's husband, Dr. Chase, and their daughter, Abbey. They don't expect her to start immediately. And they tell her to relax and start tomorrow. Lori gives Mariela the rules for their home, and Mariela agrees and goes to bed.<br/><br/>Mariela has free time in the morning because Chase is at work, Abbey has school, and Lori has a doctor's appointment. She goes for a run but feels someone is following her. Mariela runs further down the trail, and a man, Jacob, grabs her. She quickly punches Jacob in the nose and flees. Mariela tells Lori about Jacob, and Lori panics. She thinks Lori's concern is kind but unwarranted. Mariela calls Ana and updates Ana on the dangerous encounter. Ana wants Mariela to come home, but Mariela assures Ana she's okay. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Mariela's life is in danger, and she will need her friends, wit, and fist to survive.<br/><br/>The premise is stale, but the acting and dialogue make the plot feel brand new. Mariela isn't a shrinking violet waiting for a savior. She punches like Laila Ali and thinks fast on her feet. Fans will assume where the story's going, but it's a misdirection. And the conclusion is realistic, purposeful, and fun. This movie is the best story in the 2023 Stranger Danger series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"First Comes Love, Then Comes Murder",
  "review":"Ken comes home and attends to his pregnant wife, Candice, and daughter, Dasia. The meal is uneventful until Ken discovers Candice went bowling. He becomes furious and demands she clears her activities with him first. Candice gets cramps later that night, and Ken takes her to the hospital. Unfortunately, Candice has a miscarriage, and Ken blames it on bowling.<br/><br/>Two years later, Candice is pregnant again, but sadly Ken's physical and mental abuse has elevated. He demands hot food at ungodly hours, forces sex, and dictates that Candice calls him sir. Also, he refuses to interact with the unborn baby until Candice gives birth.<br/><br/>Ken's boss, Tom, pulls Ken aside to talk. Candice's law firm is putting pressure on Tom's company. Tom tells Ken to stay married because spousal privilege could help if they get an audit. Ken comes home with a new attitude and pulls out the red carpet for Candice. While Candice soaks in the tub, Ken finds the number for a divorce attorney. Now, he wants Candice to die.<br/><br/>The set-up seems bland, but a well-written script will keep you glued to your seat. During Candice's first pregnancy, viewers will spot the red flags for Ken's behavior. The plot hits each step of the abuse cycle and highlights when it's the most dangerous for a survivor to leave. This movie pinpoints the critical role that friends and teachers play for anyone escaping domestic violence. It does this without getting preachy and staying funny. This film will have you concerned and laughing at the same time.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Everyone in their family went to the prestigious school except Lacy. Nicole promises to get in and reports her tie for valedictorian. Drake requests to know who is Nicole's competition and she responds that it's Parker Williams. Parker's mother, Mandy, beat Lacy 20 years ago for the spot in Whittendale. Drake warns Nicole that a close competitor will force the admissions office to scrutinize extracurricular activities. Nicole reports that she is running for class president against Parker.<br/><br/>Parker beats Nicole in the election by a few dozen votes.
