    "mtitle":"Whitney Houston and Bobbi Kristina: Didn't We Almost Have It All",
    "review":"Family, friends, and co-workers sit down and talk about Whitney Houston and her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, and their connection. Then, Nick Gordon's brother exposes a small look into Nick's world.  As Whitney dealt with her sexuality, public persona, molestation, and tumultuous relationship, she spiraled deeper into drugs but hoped to be a good mother to Bobbi Kristina.  While Bobbi Kristina wasn't famous for her talents like her parents, she was infamous because of them.  She was the center of tabloid magazines and gossip as Whitney and Bobby's drug addictions caused many to question their parenting skills. With each reveal of abandonment, a need for love, and a need for comfort, the viewer gets a glimpse of how Bobbi's life paralleled Whitney's.  Whether by nature or nurture, fate doomed this pair.<br/><br/>It's great to see people who never spoke about Whitney or Bobbi publicly speak their truth.  But you didn't learn much that you couldn't have learned from the TV movie or the theater movie.  This movie had more new information about Bobbi Kristina than Whitney. But fans were so focused on Whitney they never understood the scope of Bobbi's sorrow.  Bobbi was a tabloid sensation, a money-hungry people's target, and a drug-dealer's dream.  All the while, like her mother, Bobbi had a need to be loved, accepted, and herself.  This movie is the story of two women in pain that died the same.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After surviving an attack, Beth pretends to be okay.  But her husband, Nick, can see something is wrong.  When Beth arrives at work, her friend, Simone, tells Beth to go to a therapist to work through the trauma, but Beth says no. However, her nightmares and panic attacks get worse.  So, Beth finally agrees to see Simone's therapist and waits anxiously in his lobby.  A woman comes out of Dr. Marsha's office and introduces herself to a nervous Beth.  Seeing Beth needs something to calm her nerves, Marsha offers Beth coffee in her office. Beth leaves Dr. Marsha's office with a renewed sense of self and makes another appointment. Later, Nick has unexpected news.  His boss, Trevor, invited their new client over to Nick's house for a home-cooked meal.  With their business model changing, Nick needs this new client's account to keep his job. Dr. Marsha is Nick's new and most important client.  Beth thinks it's a funny coincidence, but Simone believes something is wrong.  While Beth tries to assure Simone everything is okay, Beth couldn't be more incorrect.  Dr. Marsha is a woman on a mission to destroy Beth's life, and many will suffer so Marsha can get satisfaction.<br/><br/>This movie has a plot that keeps you watching until the end.  You don't know Dr. Marsha's motive for ripping Beth's life apart until Marsha starts monologuing.  During a slobber knocker fight, Marsha reveals her disdain for Beth, Nick, and Jess. The middle gets redundant for a Lifetime movie, but the beginning and end are well worth the watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Wendy Williams: The Movie",
    "review":"Wendy Williams grew up as the tallest, heaviest, and only black girl on the block, and her parents never let her forget it. At the store, she would see the gossip rags.  Wendy wanted to be one of the rich and thin celebrities on the cover.  During her sophomore year in college, she got her first radio show. Soon, she is playing the contemporary hits and calling the shots.  It wasn't until later that Wendy found her winning formula.  She turned her love of tabloid magazines into a tell-all radio show about Hip Hop and R and B artists. After her first marriage, Wendy enjoys the single life.  Then, she meets Kevin Hunter. He made himself indispensable in her life as a manager, promoter, counselor, and bodyguard. While Wendy focuses on her rise to the top with Kevin, she has yet to understand he will be her most dominant anchor.  Between miscarriages, emotional abuse, and affairs, Wendy will have to summon all her strength to practice what she preaches.<br/><br/>Wendy only holds back three things from this movie: her son, her first marriage, and her rapist's name.  Otherwise, Wendy exposes her raw and unfiltered self from her formative years to now. Wendy talks about rape, abortion, miscarriages, stillbirth, Eric B, abuse, Kevin, the rise to the top, drug addiction, hyperthyroidism, Grave's disease, on-air fainting, and her family.  She puts it all on the table and took control of her life story. You are in for one hell of a ride, and no, you don't know her story.  So, watch and have your tea ready.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
