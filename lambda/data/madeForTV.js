    "review":"Savannah and Brad pack for their vacation with their young daughter Aria. Savannah won a week-long trip to the Koala Bay Nature Resort in Australia.  She vacationed there with her parents as a child, but Savannah hasn't been back for years.  Neither of them remembers entering the contest, but they are happy to take the trip.  When they arrive by boat, the captain tells them the ferry is the only way on or off the resort.  At check-in, they meet the concierge, Jane, who walks them around the hotel. If parents want to be alone for dinner, a movie, or any other activity, they can drop their children off at the kids club.  After the tour, Jane calls Pete to get their bags and show them to their cabin.  Later, Brad and Savannah meet their cabin neighbors, Gabby and Nick. The next day, Brad and Savannah want to go on a date, so Jane offers to take Aria to the Kids club.  Brad and Savannah have a great date, and Brad goes to the cabin while Savannah goes to get Aria.  Pete tells Savannah they have no record of Aria being there, and Savannah panics.  She has proof that Aria was there, but no one knows where Aria is now.  At first, they believe Aria is lost, but when someone sends pictures of the little girl, they know someone kidnapped Aria.  Savannah must look inside herself to find the culprit.<br/><br/>Congrats to Lifetime for providing a solid H.M.M. mystery.  There were plenty of suspects with unusual behavior from the employees, housekeeping, and the police.  At one point or another, you will lose and gain trust for every character in the movie.  By the end, you will feel justified and satisfied with the who and why. The actors gave solid performances all around.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jenna loves the spirit of dance but not the competition, and that's evident at her ballet studio in the town of Avon. Her students will perform in the town Festival on the main stage. With this good news, bad follows quickly.  Two of her dancers left for a competitive dance team, and her landlord will raise her rent.  With less income and more cost, Jenna isn't sure how to make up the difference quickly.  After a long day of classes, Jenna sits with her cousin Terry and have dinner.  Terry works with the New York Rangers, and his client, Ryan Cooper, suffers from a bad sprain. If he doesn't get better, Ryan will have to retire.  Ryan doesn't know what to do because he tried acupuncture, stem cell injections, and laser treatment.  But nothing can make the pain go away.  Terry remembers Jenna had the same injury, but she dances without issue today. The best way to strengthen those muscles is with ballet.  She recommends some great ballet teachers in New York.  Terry takes her suggestions, but he wants her to train Ryan and tells her it pays well.  Jenna continues to say no until she can't convince her landlord to lower the rent.  Jenna calls Terry and tells him, 'I will rehab Ryan.'  As she works on Ryan's ankle, Ryan will work on her flexibility, confidence, and friends.<br/><br/>With a host of cute kids, inspirational quotes, and chemistry, this movie makes up in warmth what it lacks in engagement.  With scenes comparable to The Game Plan, this film brings laughs when Ryan tries ballet and feels it's after-effects.  While Ryan is consistently late, he isn't selfish.  Ryan sees the spark in others and tries to nurture it. Ryan is a nice guy who needs a watch.  This movie inspires you without needing your full attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After getting her life back on track, Julie moves into a new home with her daughter, Maddie, with Charles's help.  Charles is Julie's old friend, and his great aunt owned the house.  Charles walks Maddie and Julie around the home, but Maddie walks away from the tour.  Maddie walks into her room and finds a man standing there. Charles explains that the man is Connor, the handyman.  While this reassures Julie, Maddie thinks Connor is creepy.  Their first night in the house, Julie believes she can hear something moving in the attic. She goes to the kitchen and sees Maddie can't sleep either.  Julie attributes their restlessness to being in a new home, and they try to sleep. At work, Julie's friend, Annie, tries to get more information about Julie, her new home, and her love life.  Annie believes Charles is in love with Julie, but Julie tells her they are just friends. The next day, Julie calls Connor about the noises in the attic.  As he checks it out, Annie comes over to visit.  Before she can knock on the door, TJ, Julie's neighbor, stops her.  He wanted to make contact with Julie for days but keeps missing her.  As the days go by, weird things keep happening to Julie, like, her clothes go missing, her shower is dripping, and she still hears sounds.  But when someone goes missing, the truth will be behind a locked door.<br/><br/>While this movie tries to add mystery with a slew of suspects, the antagonist acts so weirdly it's obvious who the bad guy is. While the plot tries to play his behavior off as eccentric, a loyal Lifetimer can see the writing on the wall.  This plot is predictable, but it adds words of wisdom through Annie.  And there is a moment Julie catches Shane, Maddie's boyfriend, in her bedroom in the middle of the night.  That moment is pure gold and saves the film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Seven months after being mugged on the street, Rachel moves to the suburbs with her boyfriend, Peter.  She is pregnant with their first child and hates when Peter treats her like glass.  While Rachel is out of work, Peter suggests Rachel get to know the neighbors.  First, she sees Gary across the street, but he doesn't acknowledge her presence.  Then, Rachel goes to the bakery and meets Gary's wife, Grace. After grocery shopping, Rachel meets mommy blogger Yvonne. Next, Rachel meets Sandy, who believes everyone is strange but harmless. Later that night, Rachel hears a noise downstairs.  She grabs a melon and prepares to attack.  But it's Peter's controlling mother, Patricia. One day, Rachel looks out the window and sees Yvonne's husband kissing the nanny, and Yvonne comes home.  Yvonne comes up the steps and catches them.  Then, Yvonne raises her hand to strike the nanny, but they move out of Rachel's view.  Rachel calls the police.  The police inform Rachel that the nanny wasn't there, and Yvonne wants to file a complaint against Rachel.  Now, Rachel is the neighborhood outcast, and her doctor put her on bed rest due to high blood pressure. With everyone believing Rachel is slipping into madness, she thinks someone is trying to steal her baby.  Now, can she convince anyone else?<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Rear Window, this movie gets crazier by the minute.  Every neighbor is a bit off, and Rachel only adds to the fire by monitoring them.  But as the old saying goes, 'Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.' One poignant facet of this movie is Rachel and Peter's growth at the end.  They both learn to stand up for themselves and each other.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After losing a big client, Sadie returns to Westwood Hills.  She's ready to leave the marketing world behind and work in her parents' candy shop for the holidays.  Then, her parents drop a bomb.  They are selling the business and retiring. Sadie believed her parents would give the shop to her someday, so she is heartbroken to be left out.  She goes to the candy shop to meet with her father and the new buyer, Alex. Sadie believes Alex is off to a bad start because he's late. When Alex arrives, Sadie tells him he must learn how to create the chocolates they make in the store. While they cook, Alex questions why they don't outsource their candy so they can carry more.  She explains this is how her father did it, and she will keep it going. Then Sadie gets an idea, and she wants to throw her parents a retirement party.  She believes it will be easy, and she can make each guest a personal gingerbread house.  Teaching and party planning get off to a great start until Sadie gets her parents' guest list.  They have more than 100 people attending.  Sadie will have to do something she has never done before, depend on others.  With the challenge, Sadie will rediscover her talent for making candy while falling for Alex.<br/><br/>This movie will leave you with more questions than answers.  For example, what happened to Michael, Sadie's ex-boyfriend. He left Sadie a message, but she ghosted him.  While that is the typical thing to do nowadays, that's not explained in the story. Now don't be mistaken, this movie will whet your appetite, and the main characters have chemistry.  But you will find yourself hungry and confused as the credits roll.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
