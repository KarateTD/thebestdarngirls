    "mtitle": "Mormon Mom Gone Wrong: The Ruby Franke Story",
    "review": "Darcy, like millions, watch Ruby Franke's 8 Passengers YouTube channel. Ruby and her husband, Kevin, have six children and follow the teachings of the Mormon church. She created a brand that supports her family by promoting Ruby's parenting techniques. Darcy shows friend Jodi Hildebrant some of Ruby's videos. However, Darcy states that Ruby's family has problems. Their eldest son, Chad, acts out, and the Frankes have issues in the bedroom. Jodi believes they are great candidates for her counseling and asks Darcy to make an introduction.<br/><br/>Jodi meets Ruby. Immediately, Jodi offers counseling for Ruby and Kevin's marriage and with Chad. Ruby tells Kevin, but he is unsure. She informs him that the church elders highly recommend Jodi's methods to their parishioners. Kevin will consider counseling to save his marriage.<br/><br/>Ruby posts about letting her daughter go hungry at school because she forgot to pack a lunch. As Ruby edits the post, Kevin declares he will attend the men's group. Ruby praises Kevin. Then, she puts the video on YouTube. However, Ruby's fans oppose Ruby's actions. Ruby doesn't run to Kevin or her manager, Lyndsey, with her issues. She relies on Jodi. Ruby believes Jodi gets divine messages from God and follows her teachings without question. And Kevin complies with his wife. Ruby's blind devotion will lead her youngest children to the depths of hell.<br/><br/>This film attempts to explain Ruby's actions but mistakenly makes her and Kevin look like victims. Lifetimers won't see Ruby as a manipulated woman once she hurts her children. Ruby refused to see her life falling apart under Jodi's influence. She doesn't see the dark side of Jodi's ministry until it affects her. Ruby and Kevin are just as guilty as Jodi. This story will get under your skin and in your nightmares.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Operation Nutcracker",
    "review": "Lottie's boss, Hilary, has exciting news. Erica Warby fired her event coordinator for the Warby's Annual Christmas Charity Fundraiser. They will auction a rare Nutcracker, and its profits will go to the Children's Hospital. If Lottie seals the deal with Erica, Hilary will make Lottie the head of their new East Coast office. Lottie packs her green hard-shell suitcase and books a flight to Boston.<br/><br/>Tristan calls his sister, Dr. Juliet, and informs her he will be late. Juliet warns him their mother, Erica, won't be happy with his delay. Tristan opens his green hard-shell suitcase and examines the valuable Nutcracker inside. Tristan bumps into Lottie, and they grab each other's luggage. Tristan recognizes the error and fixes it. Tristan sees Lottie is nervous and inquires why. She discusses the fundraiser, but Tristan doesn't tell Lottie his mother is Erica. Instead, he tells Lottie to lean into the Nutcracker ballet for inspiration. Tristan boards first, but the airline personnel forces him to check his bag, and the luggage tag unknowingly falls off. Tristan and Lottie arrive in Boston, and he sees the pink tag on his suitcase. It's Lottie's, and they exchange again.<br/><br/>Lottie arrives at Erica's home and drops her presentation notes. She gawks at a clean-shaven Tristan standing in the doorway. Lottie takes Tristan's advice, wows Erica, and gets the job. Tristan shows Lottie her office, and she asks to see the Nutcracker. Tristan opens the suitcase and finds a ballerina doll inside. It's not his luggage. They look through the bag and realize it belongs to a father named Dave. They have five days to locate Dave and get the Nutcracker before the event, but Erica can never learn it's missing. Can Lottie and Tristan find Dave and the Nutcracker in time?<br/><br/>This cat-and-mouse game is a pure delight because viewers know how close Lottie and Tristan are to Dave and his family. Dave has the expensive Nutcracker. However, he doesn't know the value. You will cringe seeing Dave toss the artifact around and give it away. They are a few steps from each other during several scenes and have no idea. Viewers will be on the edge of their seats, wondering when Dave, his family, Lottie, and Tristian will meet. It's hilarious. This film balances the right amount of heart, comedy, and magic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "This Time Each Year",
    "review": "Lauren and Kevin have been separated for a year while co-parenting their son, Charlie. Lauren brings Charlie to Kevin's parents' home to celebrate the holidays with his father's side of the family. Charlie begs Lauren to stay. She relents but reminds everyone that it doesn't mean reconciliation. Lauren relaxes with Charlie while Kevin goes through decorations with his brother, Bart. Kevin admits that he lost his job at the bar. Kevin asks Bart to keep it a secret from Lauren because he doesn't want to disappoint her. All is well until Kevin's mom spills his secret. Lauren can't contain her surprise.<br/><br/>Lauren pulls Kevin aside. He admits to losing his job but assures her he will find another. He promises he hasn't started drinking again. Lauren, a money manager, signed a bad deal and got a fixer-upper they couldn't afford. Then, Lauren gets a call from her mother, Jane. Jane won a cruise and wants to visit the family early. She doesn't know Kevin and Lauren are separated. Lauren pleads with Kevin to keep their secret. Kevin agrees with two conditions. First, they have to go to couples therapy. Second, he wants to go on their annual date. Lauren agrees to keep the fa√ßade, but Kevin thinks it will rekindle a romance. Is he right?<br/><br/>Most Hallmark Mystery movies focus on the start of love, but this one begins at the end. Lauren and Kevin have actual problems with truthful results. Kevin, although the script never says alcoholism, lost his driver's license for a year and his job. Kevin and Lauren deal with financial issues surrounding the ill-advised home purchase. Money and addiction pull at the fragile thread of this relationship. However, viewers want them to work it out because the love exists. This Hallmark Mystery film is well-written, wonderfully acted, and beautifully directed.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Nurse's Revenge",
    "review": "Nurse Sharon completes her patient's care when they get an emergency call. Four teenagers - Cassie, Braden, Tamera, and Scott - hit another teen, Todd, with their car. While the passengers and driver walked away with broken bones and scrapes, Todd died. Sharon enters Cassie's room and questions Cassie about the accident.

Diane believes Sharon's help will get Cassie on track. However, it's step one of Sharon's deadly plan.<br/><br/>This movie is a follow-the-killer story. Sharon goes on a delicious rampage, and you will cheer for her. She uses her medical expertise to take down Cassie's friends one at a time. She worms her way into their lives and slowly drives a wedge between mother and daughter. Viewers mustn't give up on Cassie. She is bright and witty. Cassie isn't another bratty teen. She is a strong young woman with a purpose. And the plot circles back to the beginning, but you will see it coming.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Life I Can't Remember",
    "review": "A woman wakes up in a hospital room with no recollection of who she is or how she got there. Her doctor, Barry, says she has amnesia but no brain trauma. Then, a man, Dean, barrels into the room to check on his wife, Emma. Emma doesn't remember Dean, but Barry assures Dean that Emma's memories can return over time. Doctor Barry advises against removing Emma from the hospital but relents to Dean's wishes. Dean brings their marriage certificate and ID to prove his identity and relationship. And the hospital discharges Emma.<br/><br/>Emma and Dean arrive at the cabin and settle in. He tells Emma she's a freelance graphic designer whose parents died years ago. They don't have children, and Emma doesn't have siblings. Then Detective Claire knocks at the door and asks to interview Emma. Witnesses say that Emma ran into the street, so Claire asks if Emma was attempting to hurt herself. Emma tries to remember before Dean cuts them off. He believes Claire's questions are adding unnecessary stress and asks Claire to leave. Claire reports to her boss that something isn't right about Dean. And that's good news for Emma because Dean is deranged and obsessed. He will have Emma to himself forever, unless Claire stops him.<br/><br/>This movie, like Dean, is unhinged in the best way. The plot settles holes in other stories because the doctor confirms Dean's information. Some moments may seem unnecessary, but the writers bring them together at the end. And dedicated Lifetimers get a shovel to the face. While it's not the best of Shocktober, it's old-school Lifetime.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
