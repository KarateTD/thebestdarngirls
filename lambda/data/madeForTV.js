	"review":"Alexis has taken Christmas Joy from her employees, her boyfriend, and her friends.  Now, her parent's spirits will visit her on Christmas Eve to change her ways.  This update on the Charles Dickens classic, keeps the overall plot but changes enough to keep the viewer engaged.<br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"After her sister Alice abruptly dies, Lucy has 4 weeks to settle her estate, come to terms with her sister's past, and find forgiveness from the town she left behind.  This movie will have you in tears and calling family.  It is a surprising hit that falls in step with the book.<br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"Tracy and Rick have been making the best out of co-parenting.  But when their children want the whole family to spend Christmas with Tracy's judgmental parents, it may break them or make them.  A true lesson on co-parenting and forgiveness, this movie should be used as a teaching tool.<br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"Darcy comes home to finds a stressed mom, overprotective dad, clamoring ex-boyfriend, and a cute rival.  And if that wasn't enough, she is facing a company take over.  This movie is a far cry from the gender role reversal update to the Jane Austen classic.  Read the books instead.<br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
