    "review":"Olivia hears noises coming from a bedroom and looks into the keyhole. She sees her daughter, Corrine, making love to Corrine's uncle, Christopher. Corrine and Christopher profess their love, forcing Olivia to tell the truth. She tells Corrine and Christopher they are half-siblings because Malcolm assaulted Christopher's mother, Alicia. Corrine tells Malcolm she is in love with Christopher, and he erupts. Olivia knows Malcolm is going after Christopher. She finds Malcolm choking Christopher with a gun on the floor. Olivia takes the gun and fires a shot in the air. Corrine finds Garland's will and uncovers that Christopher was an equal heir, but Malcolm grabs and burns it. Malcolm privately tells Christopher about Corrine's past and offers him $10,000 to leave. Olivia runs to comfort Corrine, but Christopher and Corrine are gone with the family jewels.<br/><br/>Corrine sends a letter stating that she will not come home until Malcolm dies, and Olivia gets an idea. Olivia stabs Malcolm's self-portrait and loosens the stair railing. Soon, Nella sees Malcolm crashing to the ground. Olivia's plan was effective but incomplete. Malcolm lost the ability to speak and move his left side. Olivia believes she has Malcolm under her control once and for all. However, her need for familial connection causes Olivia to invite a wolf in sheep's clothing into the evil Foxworth Hall with a bible in hand. When this saga ends, Olivia will become what she said she never would: another non-smiling Mrs. Foxworth.<br/><br/>In the final chapter, everything hits the fan and flies around the room. It explores Olivia's ultimate control and deep descent into religion. She reads the bible, prays, forgives, and restores a church. Based on Garden of Shadows by V.C. Andrews, this movie ends in the first act of Flowers in the Attic and gives subtle hints of things to come. The costume and set designs were exquisite. The diligent detail of the period does not go unnoticed. This movie is a fitting conclusion to a beginning.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Keeping Up With the Joneses: The Wrong Inside Man",
    "review":"Robin, Carrie, Kayla, and Pam are shocked after seeing footage of Eve with Tara tied up in the background. Eve is not Pam's daughter; Eve's real name is Alice and Alice was roommates with Eve. Alice wants $10 million for the safe return of Tara, or the family will get Tara's body in pieces. Sheldon knows paying has risks but thinks it is the better option. Robin approves her inside man for the job.<br/><br/>Carrie worries she is a suspect in Leo's attack, so she calls Lance for help. So they stage a fight that goes viral to help Lance pretend to crawl back to Webb for help. Carrie will use Lance as her inside man to find out Webb's plan and Webb's involvement in kidnapping Tara.<br/><br/>Pam's inside man, Stephen, did his job to perfection. But she needs another favor. Pam wants to know what information the police have about Leo's attack. So she asks Stephen to use his connections.<br/><br/>Kayla throws caution to the wind and trusts William, but she hasn't told her family. Kayla wants to pull away from the family and start her own business, but William is using his inside men to twist Kayla's mind. With Kayla back in his life, William wants to get his hands on Kayla's trust. However, his inside men are growing impatient and want their money now.<br/><br/>After her kidnapping, Tara refuses to wait for anyone's help to find her perpetrator because she knows Eve didn't act alone. She uses her family's inside men, Sheldon and Lance, to help uncover the truth. But her most faithful inside man is herself. Who can the Jones women trust because one of them is the wrong inside man within a slew of them?<br/><br/>Don't worry, Jones's fans, because the conclusion of this season leaves the door open for more episodes. Tara's kidnapping is not the story's focus because she makes it home safely by the first act. Nevertheless, her kidnapper and the accomplice are the main characters. The sisters start to turn on each other, and it will captivate you. This movie isn't the best of the series, but it does deliver.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Hider in My House",
    "review":"Molly wrote a book about the horrific ordeal she suffered with her sister, Bella, and it's on the best-sellers list. Molly walks Bella around Molly's newly acquired luxury penthouse and offers Bella a place to stay. Bella is happy about Molly's success, but Bella doesn't want to talk about the past or attend Molly's book signings. Molly thinks the apartment is a fresh start, but she doesn't know the evil lurking in the walls. Molly and Bella blame each other when items are misplaced or gone. However, someone else is to blame and they want Molly for themselves.<br/><br/>On the heels of Phrogging: Hider in My House, this movie feels more believable and tolerable with quaint incidences. When Bella and Molly blame each other over the disappearance of food, books, and clothes, it's typical and understandable. However, Molly inserting her head through a secret hole in the wall is indescribably moronic and unsafe, and that's not Molly's worst mistake. The first act is suspenseful and intriguing. But the second half is annoying and laughable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Allie works for her friend, fashion blogger Kendra while trying to become a fashion designer. As they talk on the phone, Allie accidentally drops her phone down a running garbage disposal. She purchases a new phone with a new number. After a few text messages, Allie discovers her phone number once belonged to Cassidy, a famous designer. Now, Allie receives invites to restaurant openings, exclusive parties, portfolio reviews, and texts from Cassidy's ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>Colin is a venture capitalist and meets with his boss, Marla. Marla wants Cassidy's new collection on time, or Marla will pull her funding from the company. Without the funding, Cassidy's workers and suppliers will lose their jobs and thousands of dollars. Colin promises to get the work on time and texts Cassidy, but she doesn't respond.<br/><br/>Following Kendra's advice, Allie goes to a portfolio review and takes Cassidy's spot and name badge. Colin sees Cassidy's name on top of the portfolio and thinks it belongs to Cassidy, so he takes it and leaves the review. Allie chases after Colin and explains that the portfolio is hers, so Colin apologizes and compliments her designs. Colin says he can't get in touch with Cassidy. Allie tries to admit the truth, but Colin cuts her off with a proposition. If Allie creates designs for Cassidy, he will fund Allie's fashion line. As Colin and Allie work together to save Cassidy's business, Allie keeps the phone number mishap to herself. And Colin feeds Allie's dreams with no concept of how to make it happen without alerting Marla. Can their budding love handle the truth?<br/><br/>This movie wraps a familiar storyline into a current technology flub. Allie isn't the only person with a secret. Colin withholds a secret from Allie, and it's not her design deal. The fallout from their secrets feels unrecoverable. While the plot feels overdone, it's a creative fete with a contemporary twist.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Charlie gets a text that her boss, Gertrude, called an emergency meeting and runs to the office. Charlie's numbers prove the brick-and-mortar stores have been in a steep decline for several years. David wants to close all the stores and move everything online. Charlie interjects with data about store 24. That retailer has a steady growth in sales, but David thinks that store is an outlier. Charlie requests that Gertrude allows her to study store 24 and see what makes them different. Then, they can replicate their method and save all the stores. Gertrude says yes.<br/><br/>After an awkward introduction, Charlie and Grant, the manager, talk about the store, but she doesn't tell Grant everything. She doesn't inform him that his shop, and all the others, may close soon. Instead, she wants to apply his strategy company-wide to generate more sales. When Charlie sees Grant isn't warming up to her, she asks Grant's assistant manager, Marta, for help. Marta hints that candy cane bark from Grant's favorite store is the perfect bribe.<br/><br/>Charlie gives the gift to Grant and watches Grant operate. However, Grant isn't revealing his secrets fast enough. So Charlie tells Grant the truth. Grant panics because he cares about his employees. He vows to help Charlie learn his strategies and save the other stores. But can they beat the snake in the grass, David?<br/><br/>This movie has the setup and challenges that are familiar to Hallmark fans. However, it differs with a bit of fortune for Grant and Charlie. Destiny pulled these two together. However, this film does a 180-turn at the end. It creates an unexpected outcome but gives its leading characters the best solution for their lives.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
