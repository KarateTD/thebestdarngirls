    "review":"Jasmine returns home for lunch with her parents, Brenda and José, and her brother, Carlos. She walks inside the home to a stunning surprise, Carlos's girlfriend, Grace. Jasmine makes no effort to get close to Grace because Grace and Carlos's relationship is four months old. That changes during lunch because Carlos tells his family that he and Grace are engaged. Also, they plan to get married in one week. Jasmine gets up and excuses herself from the table. Jasmine walks to the ladies' room and hears Grace talking to another woman, Cassandra. Cassandra calls Grace Natalie and talks about their days working at a strip club. After Cassandra and Grace leave the bathroom, Jasmine is more determined to find Grace's name, past, and secrets. Jasmine has no idea that Grace will do anything to get married and find her happily ever after.<br/><br/>When Carlos says that he and Grace are four months into their relationship, you'll roll your eyes. You sit back and watch how unhinged Grace will become. While this won't be a favorite of the 'Unhappily Ever After' season, it's a comedic watch if you cheer for Grace. However, you wonder: would this happen if Jasmine accepted Grace?<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dying to Marry Him",
    "review":"Amy gets on social media and sees the wedding announcement for her former friend, Jeff. She can't believe she let Jeff slip through her fingers. Amy looks up more information on Jeff's fiancé, Macy, and formulates a plan. Amy walks to Carrie's Bridal and overhears Macy telling Carrie and her maid of honor, Jordy, that she has a lot of wedding plans and no time. When Macy leaves, Amy tells Carrie that she is a wedding planner and they could expand Carrie's business with her services. Carrie thinks it's a sound business decision and agrees. Step one of Amy's plan is complete, but she has to get rid of a small problem: her restraining order. The court-appointed therapist said Amy was deeply psychotic and delusional with violent tendencies. After an argument, Amy kills Thomas and declares herself single. With step two done, Amy needs to insert herself into Macy and Jeff's wedding and steal Jeff for herself.<br/><br/>This movie feels typical until one shocking moment makes you gasp, and you won't believe the miracle on your screen. This one scene saves the film from the clichés and brings it to another level. In addition, kudos to Jeff for being an astounding man. So, give this film a chance to grow on you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Beck goes into her boss's office and gets some unfortunate news.  He decided to let her go.  Beck packs up her things and heads home to tell her roommate and friend, Susan.  Susan thinks Beck losing her job is a step in the right direction.  Susan hands Beck a magazine with an article for a photography contest.  The first-place winner gets $10,000 cash and a travel photographer's job, and the theme for this year's competition is rural chic.  This contest gave Beck's idol, Catherine, a start, and now Catherine is social media famous.  Beck grabs a picture of a fountain and remembers Serenity Island.  She thinks it's the perfect place to capture the right images.<br/><br/>Beck arrives in Serenity and discovers the hotel is closed because of a plumbing problem.  The concierge has an idea.  A local lemon farm has a few cottages for rent, and he offers to check their availability.  Before she gets in a taxi, Beck goes to the fountain, makes a wish, and throws a coin.  The water splashes on a man at the fountain.  Beck apologizes, but he tells her she did the coin toss incorrectly.  Beck laughs at the handsome stranger.<br/><br/>Beck knocks on the lemon farm's door and starts taking pictures.  Then, Josh opens it and bumps into her, dropping his lemons to the ground.  Beck helps Josh and sees he is the handsome stranger she met at the fountain.  Josh's father, Matthew, owns the farm, and Josh assists Matthew.  Susan calls Beck excited.  Her latest lemon farm posts got tons of likes, and Catherine started to follow Beck online.  Josh takes Beck into town to get more images, and Matthew is thrilled to have more customers.  Beck thinks an online presence will help the farm gain clientele, but Josh disagrees.  He doesn't mind Beck taking pictures for a pamphlet but refuses social media.  She tells Josh it's a personal project, and Josh agrees to the pamphlet only.<br/><br/>Catherine's 15 minutes of fame quietly dims, but Beck inspires Catherine to enter the contest again.  With her idol becoming her competition, Beck's worries grow.  However, Josh uncovers a secret.  The farm is in foreclosure.  Beck must post pictures to win the competition and save the farm without Josh finding out.  If he does, she could lose his budding love.<br/><br/>This sweet movie follows the format but removes the ex-girlfriend's return and replaces it with an idol's.  You have the lead getting a poor twist of events, followed by a trip out of town that causes a run-in with the love interest.  The plot doesn't wow you, but the cinematography does.  This movie won't be a Destination Romance favorite, but it's a beautiful way to spend two hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Author Frida moves to Sweet Meadow with her daughter, Jade.  Frida meets Louise, the volleyball coach, and they make a connection over their daughters.  Louise's daughter, Mayson, plays on the team.  After Jade makes the team, she invites Teanna, a teammate, to Surprise Saturday.<br/><br/>Jade asks Frida for a new dress for Mayson's birthday party.  Although Frida promised to give it some thought, now she snaps at the barrage of requests and says no.  She leaves the party to go on a walk and sees an unfamiliar face, Rick.  Rick tries to flirt, but Jade shoots him down and goes back inside.  Jade notices everyone is looking at their phone, and she gets a notification.  Someone killed Teanna.  Rick gives Jade a ride home, but she still won't go out on a date with him.<br/><br/>Frida fears a killer is on the loose, so she won't let Jade leave the house for anything other than school and volleyball.  Jade gets on the computer and discovers Frida's secret.  Frida is heavily in debt, and their home is in foreclosure.  Frida confessed to Louise but decided not to tell Jade to protect her.  Jade goes to her bedroom, tries to understand her mother's financial hardships, looks out her window, and sees Rick doing his best 'Say Anything' boombox rendition.  They have a nice dinner out and run out before the bill comes.  She tells Rick about Frida's money troubles, and Rick has a way to help.  Rick wants Jade to go to rich people's parties at their home.  Once inside, she will case the house for valuables and make copies of their keys.  When Jade protests, he explains that the victims will write it off on their insurance and get paid.  So, no one will be a victim.  He vows to split the proceeds with Jade, and she accepts.  But there will be victims, including Jade.<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn to give you complex backstories and necessary character arches.  Expert Lifetimers can spot the person behind the curtain after a few plot setups.  But discovering who the puppet master is is only half the twist.  The reason this plan started is more complex and intriguing.  Of course, you have the bratty teen.  So parents, prepare yourself to become enraged by Jade's behavior.  This film is easy to watch, but prepare yourself for a slow start-up and a rapid conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
