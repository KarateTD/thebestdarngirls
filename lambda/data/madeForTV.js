    "review":"Kristen's parents, Carol and Peter, and her teacher question Kristen about her top college choices. High school senior Kristen doesn't understand why they pressure her so much for an answer. Besides, Kristen creates fashion content online and receives a few brand deals and promotional items. She sent some pictures to a fashion school in Paris, and they believe she has the fortitude to excel. Kristen needs $1,000 for the deposit and approximates $9,000 for living expenses for the year-long program.<br/><br/>After dinner, Kristen sits her parents down and explains her plans to go to Paris after high school. They disagree 100%. They will not let her use her college fund to pursue fashion school.<br/><br/>Kristen meets her friend, Riley, at school to discuss options. They work together, but that job won't pay her $10,000 in a few months. Kristen believes her parents will take her dream seriously if she raises the money in time. Kristen remembers a classmate talking about Exclusive Patreon, where subscribers pay for exclusive content. She makes an account and the money rains. As Kristen's bank account grows, her school work declines, her relationships suffer, and her safety is in jeopardy.<br/><br/>This 'Only Fans' warning didn't need to happen if Kristen's parents learned to compromise. With that aside, Kristen, although 18, makes alarming mistakes. Also, Kristen becomes addicted to her phone and the attention. She depends on her clients' comments to brighten her day. This film isn't exposing anything viewers don't know about gateway sites, social media, and cam girls.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Crowdsource Murder",
    "review":"Monica gets high praise from her boss, Richard, for exceeding the company's donation record. Afterward, Richard introduces their newest staff member, Rebecca. Monica pulls Richard aside after the meeting to talk about her potential raise. Richard says no. Rebecca asks to meet outside work, but Monica says maybe another day.<br/><br/>Monica returns home to see her ex-husband, Brian, give her daughter, Shannon, his old laptop. Monica's frustration grows, so she calls Rebecca to vent. Monica needs money for Shannon's basketball fees, and Brian doesn't help financially.<br/><br/>As Rebecca and Monica enjoy girls' night, Monica gets a call from the hospital. Shannon broke her fibula playing basketball with Brian. However, Monica's money troubles aren't over. She owes the hospital $25,000. Rebecca counsels her to join a crowdsource website to obtain the funds. After a few hours, one donor, Noah, supplies all the money.<br/><br/>Monica and Brian meet Noah in person to thank him for the donation. Brian doesn't like Noah and snoops around Noah's office. Before they leave, Noah invites Monica to spend a day at a soup kitchen with him. And she obliges. In Noah's driveway, Monica chastises Brian for rummaging through Noah's belongings because Noah is doing something nice for Shannon. Monica thinks Noah is a nice guy. She has no idea how dangerous nice guys can be.<br/><br/>Noah is a creep with Nice Guy Syndrome. When she doesn't want him after Noah gives her money, then she is ungrateful. However, a woman is a gold digger if she wants him after he gives her money. As the script dives into Noah's past, the viewer discovers Noah has this problem with anyone in his life and becomes violent. Monica and Rebecca are naive and too accommodating to the men in their lives. This movie is something to watch when you need the cathartic release of screaming at the screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lucy and Roy prepare to leave for work. Roy reminds Lucy they have a reservation at an upscale restaurant to celebrate. Later, Lucy waits for Roy to pick her up, but he is late. Her boss, Odette, tells Lucy to forget Roy, and they can hang out together. Roy enters with flowers and an apology. After dinner, Lucy questions the strength of their relationship. Roy admits their relationship needs some spice. He wants to role-play and meet in a random bar. Lucy hesitantly agrees.<br/><br/>Lucy wakes to a package at her door. Inside the package is a note from Roy, a scarf, and a blonde wig. Roy wants Lucy to wear the items and go by the name Maggie. Lucy puts her apprehension aside and gets dressed for Roy and his game. Before leaving, Lucy puts on red lipstick.<br/><br/>Roy meets Lucy and loves her sexy look but removes her lipstick. They have a passionate night together and feel more connected. Lucy goes to work and sees a TV news report about the missing socialite Magnolia Manes. Lucy sits in stunned silence because the scarf Roy gifted her looks like Magnolia's. The reporters conduct an ambush interview, and Magnolia's friend calls her Maggie. Lucy convinces Odette to let Magnolia be her next story. Roy grows tired of playing second fiddle to Lucy's work, so he breaks up with her. Lucy's investigation intensifies after someone stalks and attacks her. Can Lucy uncover the truth before losing her life?<br/><br/>This movie is a Ferris wheel of emotions. First, the script points to Roy as the abductor. Then, Lucy interviews people in Magnolia's life, and viewers will look elsewhere. The audience watches for two hours to prove their first hunch. Also, the lead is unlikeable. This film drags you through a predictable ending with unnecessary interviews and a tedious investigation.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

They are in a toxic workplace relationship because Abby does all the work, but Serena takes the credit. Jack is intelligent because he spots a discrepancy between Serena's marketing and the show's advice. The movie starts slow, but the final 30 minutes make the film worth watching. Abby finds her voice and follows a new path. So, viewers should watch for a solid ending and the worst and funniest gift basket.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Betty's Bad Luck in Love",
    "review":"Twenty years ago, Betty sat with her best friend, Mya, and talked about Betty's crush, Brian. Betty worried because Eleni liked Brian too. Mya said it doesn't matter, and Betty shared Oreos with Brian. Eleni caught them and cursed Betty and her future partners.<br/><br/>Today, Betty sits in a cab with her boyfriend. When he tries to get out, a car almost hits him. Betty thinks it's the curse and breaks up to save him. She relaxes at a restaurant with Mya to discuss Mya's wedding. Betty eludes to the breakup but brushes it off.<br/><br/>Betty wakes up late and rushes to get dressed. At the lobby, Betty sees someone moving into the building. She can't believe someone is moving in on a Friday morning. The new resident, Alex, tries to talk to her, but she leaves in a hurry. Betty comes to an empty office and realizes it's Saturday. She embarrassingly returns to the apartment and into Alex's gleeful gaze. Later, they meet in the elevator again and get stuck after an earthquake. Betty panics because she is an actuary. But Alex keeps her calm and collected throughout the ordeal. He invites Betty to have celebration drinks, and she obliges. After a great first date, Betty admits she likes Alex but can't stop thinking about her curse. She must keep an eye on him to make sure the curse doesn't strike. Will their love defeat the curse this time?<br/><br/>Betty has had a couple terrible, horrible, no good, very bad decades. Everything becomes a warning. She borders on crazy. When the plot gets too wild, the writer grounds it into reality with one heroic stunt. That moment will draw the audience into the film and separate it from the pack. This movie is exciting and funny.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
