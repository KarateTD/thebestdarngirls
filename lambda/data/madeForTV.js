    "review":"Lizzie and John will be parents in 2 weeks and moved into their first house. Lizzie's parents will come tomorrow to enjoy Christmas with them. However, most of their stuff is in boxes all over the house. Then, the doorbell rings. Lizzy's parents, Frank and Evelyn, came a day early. Lizzie and John step out of their home for some fresh air. Lizzie and John didn't think their first day at 7 Cherry Lane would be like this.<br/><br/>Regina's kids, Conrad and Winnie, create a plan on the front porch of 7 Cherry Lane. They will talk, eat, exchange gifts, and leave by 5 pm. Regina runs to the door when her boyfriend, Nelson, arrives with his new car. Winnie wants to drive it, but Nelson will save the first drive for his future wife. Regina reveals that she is engaged. Also, Regina will retire, sell the house, and move to Florida. Conrad vows to remake their Christmas memories so Regina will want to stay.<br/><br/>Quinn rings the doorbell at 7 Cherry Lane, and Mike and Zain answer in a panic. They have 14 guests coming over for Christmas dinner, and their kitchen is a disaster. Quinn promises to complete it soon, but Chef Mike wants to cook the meal at his restaurant. However, Zain wants the smell of Christmas dinner to waft through the house. Then, their social worker, Ann, comes to the door. Mike and Zain passed the final test, and a foster kid needs a placement tonight. As they say yes, a loud clang comes from the kitchen. They pull Ann outside and say they are ready. However, Mike isn't sure because the bedroom is empty, the kitchen is a mess, and 14 people will arrive for an unprepared dinner.<br/><br/>These three families face life-altering events in the same house but at different times. Lizzie and John are living in 1973. Conrad and Winnie never thought 1999 would end with their mother remarrying, retiring, and moving. Mike and Zain live in the current year and are updating Regina's old kitchen to match Chef Mike's needs. They share a beautiful and unbreakable bond, but only if they can make it through this holiday.<br/><br/>This movie is for Hallmarkies begging for a new storyline in Hallmark movies. This period film doesn't focus on someone finding love or career fulfillment. Fans will watch and try to make the connections. While one or two will be correct, there are more links than you can imagine. This story is beautifully scripted, acted, and set. It will stay on your DVR.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Magic in Mistletoe",
    "review":"Famous author Harrington posts on social media and alienates his fans. He told the world he wasn't writing the 6th and final book in his Magic in Mistletoe series. And Christmas was only about the money. Harrington's publishing company, Silver Spark, must do damage control. Publisher Mallory calls their public relations expert, April, for help.<br/><br/>Mallory gathers the team into the war room and asks for opinions. April tells them about the Mistletoe Christmas Festival. Harrington hasn't been to his hometown, Mistletoe, in 5 years. The townspeople can post about it while Harrington does an apology tour. Mallory loves April's idea and runs with it. Now, April has to get Harrington on board.<br/><br/>Harrington sips his drink at a coffee shop while patrons give him dirty looks. A woman, April, walks in with a copy of Magic in Mistletoe and asks him to sign it. He notices the well-worn pages and questions her love for the series. April tells him she works for Silver Spark. April briefs Harrington her PR plan, and he says no. April threatens to sue Harrington for breach of contract and leaves. She will fly to Mistletoe and hopes he will be there.<br/><br/>April travels to Harrington's childhood home, which is now a museum for the books. Harrington's friend, Chris, lets her inside. She quips about Harrington's attitude and sees Harrington standing behind her. He agrees to attend three events of the festival and nothing more. She hopes to ease Harrington's prickly demeanor so he can retract his statement and release his final book. But will this trip home uncover more?<br/><br/>This movie starts with sharp dialogue as April and Harrington verbally spar. While viewers haven't read the fictional book, it comes to life through Harrington's friends, their costumes, and the locations. But viewers don't know what made Harrington turn on his novels, The Town of Mistletoe and Christmas. Once April and Harrington fall in love, the plot slows down and wanders into ordinary territory. This movie isn't a favorite, but you can spare a few hours to give it a chance.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sam works at his father's development company. His dad, Otto, hands Sam a memory box. Later, Sam's cousin, co-worker Ella, hands Sam his mail. Sam reads a letter with an elephant stamp and runs out of the office. He hops on his motorcycle and rides to the creek.<br/><br/>Ceci gets a call from her art student's parents. Their child left their phone at the creek. She can't find the phone and calls Penny. Ceci sees a man riding a motorcycle through the woods. Then, the rider, Sam, disappears in the trees, and Ceci hears a sickening crash. His shoulder is injured, but he is conscious. Ceci stays by his side but keeps his helmet on to prevent more injuries. Sam comments on her elephant necklace and beauty. He asks Ceci to marry him on Christmas if he survives. She accepts his proposal, and Sam passes out.<br/><br/>Ceci goes to the hospital to check on Sam. With bribery, she gets Sam's room number. She brings a hamburger, a drink, and an elephant balloon. Ceci sees a text message on Sam's phone about a development deal. She runs out of the room before Sam returns and goes to work to look up Sam online.

She worries her stepmother, Vivian, wants to sell half her father's property.<br/><br/>Ceci and Penny return to the hospital, but Ceci takes off her necklace. She doesn't think Sam saw her face, but he would recognize the necklace. They ask Sam if he is in town for a land acquisition, but he doesn't offer any information. He does request a favor. Sam wants to put an ad in the paper to find the woman who saved him. Ceci will get closer to Sam to learn more about the deal, and he will do the same to discover if she saved him. They will find the link that brings them together, saves each other, and enriches the town.<br/><br/>This movie has several mysteries with one common denominator. That person created a legacy that healed others who suffered similar trauma. This film starts like Angel Eyes, but it gets better. Viewers should watch this movie when they can dedicate two hours to it. If you miss a moment, the story will not make sense. H.M.M. is the perfect place for this gem.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mallory entices her literary fans at the Gideon book reading and signs autographs. She utters to her manager, Michael, that this will be the last book of her successful series. Before Michael interjects, Carrie approaches the table with a book in hand. Carrie tells Mallory that she is Mallory's #1 fan and dedicates a podcast to her characters. Michael cuts Carrie off and sends Carrie away.<br/><br/>After the signing, Michael begs Mallory to continue the series, but she wants to write meaningful books for herself. Michael meets with Mallory's publisher, Wendy, and updates Wendy on Mallory's proclamation. Wendy reminds Michael that they have an agreement. They will sue for her advance and damages if Mallory doesn't write another Gideon novel. Wendy sees the look on Michael's face and knows he didn't tell Mallory about her advance because he kept it.<br/><br/>Michael talks to Mallory, but she won't budge. So, he gives Mallory his winter cabin key. It has everything she needs, including a space to write. She reluctantly takes the key and drives to the cabin. Mallory settles in with a book but wakes up handcuffed to a bed in the basement. Michael demands she uses every spare moment writing the next Gideon novel, or he will end her life. To make sure no one looks for her, Michael reported that Mallory died. Her fans mourn, but one fan finds the story suspicious and will start a one-woman search party. It's Carrie on the case.<br/><br/>One thing is true: Mallory has determination. However, Michael stays a step ahead or fights back. Carrie's admiration comes full circle in this film. Don't let the opening scene fool you with Carrie's enthusiasm. This film isn't Misery. It's not the best of the Slay Bells season. But it's solid entertainment.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
