    "review":"To get her dream promotion, Erin must open a hotel in her home town. On her first day, she sees protestors outside the hotel. The locals don't want the hotel in their town because it will hurt small businesses. And to add insult to injury, her old crush, Connor is leading the charge. Erin has to ease the fears of the locals to keep her promotion and stop the protesting. Good thing she has love on her side.<br/><br/>With a predictable outcome, this movie has a few redeemable qualities. First, the chemistry between the lead actors. Second, how Erin’s changes have impacted the community. Finally, seeing your favorites from TV shows like Moesha, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Family Matters on screen again.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

The hotel manager, Jonah wants something festive but the owner doesn't want the typical Christmas cliches.  Cara and Jonah will need 3 tries to find the design and love.<br/><br/>This movie is the A Cheerful Christmas and Rediscovering Christmas with a few more tries.  Only the other attempts of Christmas decorations stand out.  The rest of the story falls flat.  This movie is lost with over 50 movies being aired this season.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ashley can get her birth mother's name after a law is changed allowing sealed adoption records to be unsealed. She finds her mother, Sara, and the two connect instantly. But Sara's husband Trevor and Trevor's daughter Amy never knew Ashley existed. Trevor is tired of his wife's secrets but he is happy to except Ashley. Amy warns Ashley that finding her mom may not be a great thing. One day, Sara wakes up and Trevor is dead. Soon, the police have Sara in handcuffs. Sara asks Ashley to help her and find the real murderer. Too bad the police and Amy are not on her side.<br/><br/>This movie is not a bad mystery. With so many adoption-murder stories, you assume you know who the bad guy is but keep watching. The only downfall is the movie gives you the murderer a few steps to early.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

And her favorite, unsigned writer, Tina Finnegan, has moved into her ex-boyfriend's Air B.N.B.. She must get along with her ex-boyfriend Brian to break the ice with Tina.<br/><br/>Unlike the other Angel Falls movie, you don’t know who the angel, Anthony, is helping. He mentions that love is simple, so you know love is the key and you make assumptions from there. With help, Anthony is able to complete his mission and have a happy accident.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
