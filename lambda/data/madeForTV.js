    "review":"Tracy runs to her boss, Ed, and asks for an advance.  She needs to run from her abusive boyfriend Bobby.  If Bobby discovers she is 21-weeks pregnant, he will shoot her.  Ed gives her all the cash he has and Tracy leaves work with a trash bag full of clothes.  But she finds Bobby waiting for her.  Once Bobby is out of sight, she runs.  Tracy gets a hotel room and finds an adoption agency.  The adoption liaison introduces her to Patrick and Genevieve Parker.  After meeting the Parkers, Tracy still isn’t sure but the liaison talks her into adoption.  Back at the hotel, the manager starts to harass Tracy for payment.  When he gets too touchy-feely, Patrick comes to Tracy’s rescue.   Patrick offers to let Tracy stay at their house for the night.  After one night, Tracy picks the Parkers to adopt her baby girl.  They are elated and asks her to sign a contract.  Without reading one word, Tracy signs it and moves in until the baby is born.  Tracy doesn’t know that the Parkers are unhinged.  Patrick is not taking his meds and Genevieve hasn’t been open about her past.  But leaving isn’t the easiest option, Bobby is hot on Tracy’s tail.<br/><br/>It’s hard to know where to start.  This movie brings the crazy level to ten from the very beginning.  Having people coming at Tracy from all angles gets you invested and interested.  There are two critical moments in the movie that will shock you.  Tracy’s confrontation with Bobby at the mall and Genevieve’s confrontation with Bobby at their house.  You have no idea who you want to win.  And the wrap-up is worth the wait.  This is a fun watch to save on your DVR.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Seeing breathtaking nature and the rustic resort will make you want to try Glamping.  It’s a far cry from an ordinary tent in the woods.
