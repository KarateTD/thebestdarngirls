    "review":"Eliza takes a much needed vacation with her three best friends.  She finds a necklace under a dresser and packs it away.  When she spots a missing flyer with a girl wearing the same necklace, she confronts her rental home's owner, James.  At first he denies knowing the missing girl until Eliza acknowledges the necklace.  Now, she wants to leave but her friends want to stay one more day.  This decision will prove fatal.<br/><br/>Be ready to slap a cop in the face.  It only takes a few nice words and back goods for the police to love James and shoot down anyone who disagrees with him.  This plot does have exciting moments but you will roll your eyes and dumb Lifetime mistakes made by each character.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie was able to save a pregnant woman during a convenience store robbery, but a man was murdered.  With her time in the service, this only added to her PTSD.  Ten years later, Maggie is ready to go back to work as an EMT.  After taking her test, Maggie comes home to find her husband shot and her daughter kidnapped.  Maggie and her family's life is on the line unless she finds out who is behind it all.<br/><br/>This movie breaks the Lifetime mold.  It ramps up in the first 10 minutes and keeps going.  The villian is devious and diabolic.  She feeds her husbands ashes to a venus fly trap and wants to watch the murder of Maggie's family.  You will watch this movie on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

While she believes Jason is the type to do this, she is hurt when Tom, her new interest, would want to work for him.

    "review":"Whitney has been groomed to win Homecoming Queen her entire life.  Her mother, Connie, and her Grandmother, Evelyn, have been queens.  It's Whitney's destiny to follow in their footsteps.  When Natasha, a recovering addict, shows promise, Whitney doesn't know what to do.  Evelyn tells her to take control of her destiny at any cost.  Whitney's plan for control involves cyber bullying, catfishing, drugs, and murder.<br/><br/>This movie has a big build up but the ending falls flat.  You expect a fight but you get nothing but confused looks.  However, this movie offers a much better support system than any other Lifetime movie.  Normally, Natasha would not be believed because she is a former addict.  However, her mother and the police believe and help her.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
