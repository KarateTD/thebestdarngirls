    "mtitle":"The Gabby Petito Story",
    "review":"Gabby Petito joins a party and sees Brian Laundrie, an old high school friend, in the corner. She walks over and sparks a conversation with him. They go on a bowling date and fall head over heels in love. After a few weeks, Brian tells Gabby he is moving to Florida with his parents in a month. Gabby is upset with the short notice until Brian slips that he thought of asking her to come. She thinks about it for a second and says yes.<br/><br/>For a while, things seem ok until Gabby gets a new job that pays more. She thought Brian would be happy with more money, but he worries guys will hit on her, and they won't be working together anymore. They go for a walk, and Brian asks her to marry him. However, COVID-19 slows down their wedding plans. Brian gets the idea to go on the road and tour the country, but Gabby doesn't think his car is sufficient and buys a used van. She follows VanLife bloggers and adds a bed, tables, and plants to the vehicle. At the end of this trip, only one person will come back, and the other will be the subject of a nationwide search.<br/><br/>As you scream at the TV, remember their story is sadly over. This movie re-enacts Gabby and Brian's police encounter, Gabby's photos, and eyewitness accounts of their public altercations. Followers got the perfect 'couple goals' Gabby posted on social media. And when the police stepped in, Gabby blamed everything on her OCD. Also, his parents are enablers. At the movie's end, you shouldn't be mad at anyone else but Brian. Brian was a toxic, controlling, narcissistic that took the coward's way out. Watch this movie to learn the signs and recognize abusive behavior from the beginning.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"How to Live Your Best Death",
    "review":"Kristen thought divorcing her husband, Ryan, would be a step in the right direction, but she doesn't have confidence in her abilities at home or work. Kristen's sister, Sara, suggests Kristen get a life coach to boost her self-esteem and receive guidance. Kristen goes online, finds rave reviews for Ashley, and signs up for a consultation.<br/><br/>Ashley comes in the morning and tells Kristen to walk into the boss's office and demand a raise. If Kristen's boss doesn't submit, Kristen will put in her 2-week notice immediately. Kristen takes Ashley's advice and walks away from her job after her boss says no. Soon, Kristen has a new job, boss, and outlook on life. But that's not enough for Ashley. Ashley wants total control over Kristen's life. And if Kristen doesn't give in, the consequence is death.<br/><br/>This movie may seem typical at first glance but watch it once. It displays perfect cult tactics used to pull people into their way of thinking. Cults make promises like family, friends, and work, and they do deliver. However, it will all go away if you leave. Soon, they isolate you from your family and friends and change you from your appearance to your thought process. This film isn't just entertainment but a learning tool to avoid Kristen's mistakes. Diane is the authentic life coach in Kristen's life.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
