    "review": "Elizabeth returned to her small town with her husband, Steve, and their two children, Grace and Jackson. Elizabeth remembers her time in high school. She was popular, the head dancer of the dance team, and dated the cutest boys. She makes Grace practice tirelessly to be on the dance team. She tells Grace to smile and to stop acting like a loser. Grace wonders if she wants a spot on the team, but Elizabeth says it will open doors.<br/><br/>Grace tries out with her friend, Kath, and boyfriend, Tyler, watching. During Grace's performance, she sees Elizabeth watching from behind shelves. Grace's friends think she did great until Coach Megan calls. Elizabeth didn't make the team. Elizabeth believes Megan is still jealous of her and meets with the school board. Against Megan's wish, the school board sides with Elizabeth. They allowed every girl who tried out a spot on the dance team. Grace is happy, but Elizabeth is furious. She believes accepting all the girls removes the team's legitimacy and makes Grace the 'pity dancer.'<br/><br/>Megan steps down, and another dancer's mom, Nicole, coaches the team. Elizabeth remembers and loathes Nicole. She thinks Nicole will show favoritism towards her daughter, Hannah. Grace begs Elizabeth to back down, but she won't. Elizabeth is determined to fix Grace's mistakes and make Grace's life what hers should have been. She wants to remove Tyler, Hannah, and Nicole from Grace's life. And she will kill to do it.<br/><br/>People who rage easily shouldn't watch this film. The script allows viewers to hear the subtle digs Elizabeth throws at Grace. Grace knows her mother is unwell but excuses her behavior as 'lawnmower parenting.' Viewers will understand that Elizabeth is a narcissistic stage mom. She happily sabotages Grace to make Grace dependent on her. Lifetimers should give the costume department forgiveness for Elizabeth's wild wigs. Elizabeth is a woman on a budget that micromanages Grace's life. She doesn't have time for a stylish wig. The actors put on a superb performance. You will want to call CPS. This picture will be a favorite and guilty pleasure. It's unsure who was worse: Elizabeth or Mommy Meanest.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Perfect Killer",
    "review": "Sixteen-year-old Charlie returns after secretly partying at an adult bar, and her stepmother, Mila, sighs with relief. Earlier, Charlie's father, Jack, got a panicked call from Charlie, begging Jack to pick her up. He ran to the location and asked Mila to stay if Charlie returned home. Charlie has a bewildered look on her face because her phone is dead. Mila calls the police to check the location, and Detective Faulkner arrives. Sadly, someone shot and killed Jack.<br/><br/>Alyssa follows Charlie in the shadows, trying to build the courage to tell Charlie the truth. She is Charlie's birth mother and Jack's ex-wife. After their divorce, he fought for sole custody and won. With Jack gone, it will be easier for Alyssa to open a line of communication.<br/><br/>Charlie calls her friend, Matthew, multiple times before he answers his phone. Matthew finally talks to Charlie but has reservations. A few months ago, Matthew went on a walk and saw his mother, Rebecca, having an affair with Jack. Now, he feels ill watching Rebecca pretend to be Mila's best friend after Jack's death.<br/><br/>Charlie admits she wants to spend more time with her godmother, Melody. However, Mila and Melody don't speak. Melody explains that their falling out started when Melody divorced Tim. Tim spent so much money that he lost everything. Tim owed Jack a lot of money until Jack died.<br/><br/>During the investigation, Detective Faulkner arrives at Mila's home with questions. Faulkner asks why Mila filed for divorce a month before Jack died. Mila admits to knowing about Jack's numerous affairs. She filed for divorce but never signed the papers. Now, Mila is on Faulkner's suspects list. Nevertheless, Charlie won't wait. She will dig into her father's sordid past and unveil his killer.<br/><br/>Jack was a sneaky man with many skeletons in his closet. So, it's understandable that Charlie has a bratty attitude. The script proves that everyone in Charlie's life has lied to her. And the audience uncovers each misgiving along with her. So keep a pen and paper handy to make a murder board. The story slows towards the conclusion as Charlie pieces together the final clues. The final takedown will reveal a shocking culprit, but the confrontation is lackluster.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Murder at the Lighthouse",
    "review": "Jess calls her mom on the side of the road. Jess will leave her husband, Colton, tonight. After years of abuse, Jess can't take it anymore. She asked her college friend, Rory, to assist her escape to Canada by boat. Rory's brother, Anthony, doesn't believe now is a good time because a storm is looming. Jess begs Rory to go, and they do.<br/><br/>Deputy Foster visits Adeline at the lighthouse. Adeline assures Foster that she is comfortable. He asks her to look for anyone who washes up to shore. Adeline hunkers down for the storm.<br/><br/>Colton finds Jess's car, wedding ring, and phone by the side of the road. He spots a path and follows it to Anthony's home. He shows Anthony his badge and cautiously demands information on Jess's whereabouts. When Anthony strategically refuses, Colton kills him.<br/><br/>Adeline picks up 'bones' at the shoreline after the storm and finds Jess nearly drowned. She drags Jess to her cabin and puts her into bed. Jess awakes and says her name is Lucy. She wants to leave but has a sprained ankle. Later, Colton comes to Adeline's door with a photo of Jess. Adeline senses something is off about Colton and lies. Then, they see someone hiding in the woods. Adeline knows Jess isn't safe with Colton lurking, and they prepare. When Colton breaks in, Jess knocks him out and leaves to regain control. She overhears Adeline killing Colton. Jess realizes she isn't safe and wants to go, but Adeline won't let that happen. Can Jess escape Adeline's prison?<br/><br/>Jess is a walking host of errors. The script has Jess making continuous bad decisions that leave a string of bodies in her wake. It will drive you up the wall, but the plot pulls you in with Adeline's crazy actions. She is either a lonely woman who loses it or a killer who needs a friend. Either way, she's unhinged, and you will love it. This movie will keep you on edge and offer a helpful police officer. The plot is Misery and Sleeping with the Enemy, but it's entertaining.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Megan interviews for her app, BeScheduled, and the reporter blindsides her about being replaced. Megan scoffs at the question until she meets with the board. They want to replace Megan with the chairman's daughter. Megan leaves with her assistant, Curtis. She mentions her family and shocks Curtis. This moment is the first time Megan has spoken about them. Megan's mother, Lois, dotes on her little sister, Izzy, since their father, Gus, died. When Megan went to college, Lois met and married Ken. Ken, Lois, and Izzy have a close bond, leaving Megan feeling like an outsider. Curtis remembers Megan wanted to leave her comfort zone and suggests she visit her family.<br/><br/>Megan arrives, and to her family's surprise, she doesn't look depressed. As Megan drinks, she overhears Lois paying for Izzy's phone bill. Megan believes Izzy needs direction, not coddling, because her 30th birthday is in three months.<br/><br/>Izzy arrives at Megan's house in the morning. She agrees with everything Megan said and wants more for her life. Izzy proposes that Megan run her life like she runs a corporation. Megan thinks this idea is perfect. She will gather board members to help Izzy with her life.<br/><br/>Megan arrives at the open workspace and steals a man's parking spot. Megan runs inside to greet Izzy and introduce Izzy to her team. As they talk, the man, Dominic, enters and accuses Megan of taking his spot. She makes a quip and remembers him from his YouTube video. The psychology professor will be Izzy's unbiased observer while Megan oversees operations, so Izzy vows to adhere to their guidance and allow them to overhaul her life. Megan gets an idea to turn her project into an app and presents it to Yuki for buyers. However, she wants to keep Izzy in the dark until she completes the deal. Izzy will be a guinea pig for the app. Megan believes she is fixing Izzy's life. But Megan will find love and smooth her rough exterior while repairing bonds with her family. Will it all crumble when they learn the truth about Megan's new app?<br/><br/>The ensemble cast gets a gold star in this movie. The cast provides laughter and heart to this project. The script has many quotable lines that will live rent-free in your head. Unlike other Hallmark movies, the romance is the subplot. Dominic's purpose is to spotlight Megan's issues within her family. Megan, Izzy, and Lois regaining their family bonds will tug at your heart, while the board will make you chuckle. This film will be an all-time favorite.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Amish Double Life",
    "review": "Emma runs to get trowels to dig sweet onions with her father, Mr. Miller. Emma says hello to her mother, Mrs. Miller, as she grabs the trowels and returns to an empty field. She searches for her father and finds him dead. Then, Emma looks and sees someone running away.<br/><br/>As the family mourns the loss of their patriarch, Bishop David arrives for the family's land documents. David tells Mrs. Miller he will handle the land to ease her burden, but Emma thinks David should focus on telling the community to work with the police. David reminds Emma that she has a place in the Amish community and should hold her tongue.<br/><br/>Emma finds her friend, Rebecca, in the woods. Rebecca sneaks into the English world and has a secret phone. Emma goes to Sunday service to plead for the congregation's help, but they sit silent. Emma exhaustingly sighs. She meets Rebecca in the woods and decides to go to the English world for fun.<br/><br/>Emma and Rebecca go to the club with fake IDs. They dance and enjoy the music. Emma exits the restroom, and a man bothers her. Heath scares the man off and dances with Emma. Heath asks Emma to meet him at a specific place and time. Emma returns home with stars in her eyes and a thirst for the English world.<br/><br/>Emma, with Rebecca's help, meets with Heath. They don't want the evening to end, so Heath invites Emma to his home. After a few minutes, Heath gets a call from work. He has to leave tonight. He invites Emma to stay until he returns. Then, she hears a noise and investigates. She finds a woman dead on the floor. She washes her hands, grabs her clothes and the murder weapon, and leaves. Emma burns the clothing, and Rebecca helps Emma bury the scythe.<br/><br/>Days later, the police go to David's home. They are looking for an Amish woman, so David rings the bell and demands the young Amish women step forward. Heath looks at them and points at Emma for killing his wife. Emma must use her wits to uncover who framed her for murdering Heath's wife and the person who murdered her father.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this mystery is gripping and tantalizing. The settings use natural light and practical sets to bring viewers into the Amish way of life. It's contrary to the English world of bright lights and loud music. The costume designer made the same changes to Emma's clothes. And Emma, unlike other heroines, has a reason to lack street smarts. She trusts others to be open and honest and doesn't know how to navigate within the English world. This mystery will keep you guessing until the final twist at the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

"review": "Beverly calls her daughter, Carli, while Carli travels with her best friend, Simone. The college women want to spend spring break in Florida's South Beach. Carli begs Beverly not to worry and ends the call.<br/><br/>Simone and Carli arrive in South Beach, and Simone begs Carli to be impulsive. Carlie agrees. They pull over and drop their bags with a concierge. Simone puts her phone in her bag to deter pickpockets and gives Carli the bag receipt and ID. Carli puts the ticket into her fanny pack but keeps her phone. Simone instructs Carli to share her location. If someone steals Carli's phone, they can find it with Simone's.<br/><br/>At the bar, Simone sees Pete and flirts. Pete tells them about an exclusive party at the beach and invites them. Carli, Simone, and Pete arrive at an empty beach. Then, Pete points out his cousin, Luke. Carli freezes because Luke is her ex-boyfriend. Then Pete yells for Luke. Simone is convulsing. They argue about what to do next as Carli runs over to help. Luke says that Pete gave Simone too much. Then, Carli feels the effects of the drugs and passes out.<br/><br/>Beverly's phone wakes her. It's the police. They found Simone, and she's in a coma. Beverly decides to fly to Florida after the police refuse to look for Carli. In Florida, Carlie wakes up, blindfolded, gagged, and bound. Luke planned to drug Carli, create revenge porn, and make her lose her scholarship. It would be his revenge for dumping him. He's not sure what to do next, so Pete takes control. Carli must escape before Luke and Pete kill her. Will Beverly find her first?<br/><br/>This movie is a race to see who can be the dumbest. Beverly preaches safety but keeps herself in danger. Simone is a party girl with zero self-awareness. Pete is a manipulator, and Luke is an abusive stalker. The script foreshadows a lot as the girls decide what to bring on their club-hopping journey. However, it briefly mentions Luke. Beverly's search will drive you crazy, but Carli's fighting spirit saves the movie. She does everything possible to muster the strength to overpower her kidnappers and survive.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Desmond's courtier, Edwin, writes the royal decree for the happy couple. A few weeks later, Edwin sits at his desk and vandalizes images of Coralina. She dumped the prince for plumber Coby. Edwin knows this uproar will further strife between the two nations, and Desmond must find a way to smooth things over. Desmond remembers that Coralina has a little sister, Princess Beatrix, who dropped out of the public eye years ago as a teen. Beatrix will be the rightful heir. He vows to find Beatrix, marry her, and merge their nations.<br/><br/>Chloe knocks on her best friend's door. She gave Bea the weekend to mourn her breakup.

Bea and Chloe leave with the men, and Chloe learns about Bea's royal lineage. The men take Bea and Chloe to Edwin and Desmond. Desmond explains the situation, but Bea wants to wait until their fathers - King Winston and King Richmond - have their summit. They won't have to get married if the summit comes to a peaceful solution.<br/><br/>The summit fails spectacularly. So, Bea knows marrying Desmond is the proper course of action. Before he proposes again, Bea decides to have a fun night in Boston. She will show Desmond the world outside of his sheltered cage. However, he will reintroduce her to the royal treatment. These two inspire growth in each other, their families, and their countries.<br/><br/>Chloe and the Kings make this movie. The writers made Chloe the voice of the audience. King Winston and King Richmond's encounters give viewers the most polite takedown in Hallmark history. The secondary characters are so captivating that the primary ones become bland. Also, the editors put social media posts on screen. This addition brought the script into today's era but wasn't necessary. The conclusion highlighted the upcoming two royal movies - The Reluctant Royal and Royal-ish - while paying homage to Royal Matchmaker. This film is comical but will lose your attention momentarily.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
