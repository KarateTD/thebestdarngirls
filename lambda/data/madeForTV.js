    "mtitle": "A Kidnapping in Amish Country",
    "review": "Lena runs to the home of her ex-boyfriend, Aaron, with a suitcase. She worries he won't accept her because she turned her back on the Amish lifestyle, but Aaron doesn't have a beard. After a passionate night, Lena hears a sound coming from her suitcase downstairs. She opens the luggage, containing $500,000 and a burner phone. Lena snaps the phone in half and returns to Aaron's bed.<br/><br/>Five years later, Lena and Aaron have a daughter, Miriam. And they returned to the Amish community. Aaron and Lena try for a baby, but she does something in bed that makes Aaron uneasy. He tells her to pray and leaves the bedroom. Lena has a nightmare about a man lying dead on the floor and wakes up in a panic. She finds Aaron reading the bible. He asks if she has secrets, and Lena says no.<br/><br/>Aaron and Lena ride home after visiting their friend, Ruth. They find a man lying in the road and stop to help. The man attacks while another man kidnaps Miriam. She discovers a message written on her arm and shows Aaron. It warns them to keep quiet about Miriam's kidnapping, or they will kill her. They look over Lena's body and unearth another message. The message demands $500,000 with a meeting time and place. Lena runs to the backyard with a shovel and digs up the suitcase while Aaron scolds her for not listening to her husband.<br/><br/>Lena arrives at the location alone because Aaron chose to alert the police. She hands the man the suitcase, but that's not enough. He ties Lena to a chair, puts makeup on her, and takes pictures. Lena demands Miriam, but the man says no and leaves. Lena unties herself and scurries to an ex-communicated friend named Skye. Skye steams because Lena hasn't spoken to Skye in five years. Lena apologizes and informs Skye about Miriam but refuses to give Skye any more details. Skye relents and helps Lena. But unearthing the truth will put both of their lives in danger.<br/><br/>Lena will stay in trouble because she digs herself deeper into each situation. The Mastermind is an obvious choice for Lifetime fans. This movie took one issue, wrapped it in Amish clothing, and added a child. It tries to be a wild ride but leaves you with one question: who killed Eddie? Skye is a dedicated friend, but you can leave Lena behind with this film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Carol for Two",
    "review": "Violette leaves her hometown behind for the bright lights of Boardway and has her father, Thomas, and the town cheering for her. Thomas informs Violette that he called Hazel to keep an eye on Violette. Hazel was the best friend of Violette's aunt, Carol. Violette arrives at her audition and finds a man cleaning. The man explains that the investors pulled out of the show. So, they canceled it. Violette doesn't want to return home and disappoint everyone, so she visits Hazel's lounge called Fiore's.<br/><br/>Hazel charms patrons while giving her staff hard truths. She offers them stage time if they earn it. She extends the offer to her best waiter, Alex, if he stops extending credit to his cousin, Brad. Alex tells Brad to pay his tab.<br/><br/>Violette arrives at Fiore's and explains her situation to Hazel. Hazel offers Violette a job, gives Violette stage time, and introduces her to the staff. So, Hazel asks Rae to room with Violette and Alex to show Violette the ropes. Rae agrees, but Alex believes Violette is another entitled employee because she got a spot instantly.<br/><br/>Violette performs, the crowd goes wild, and Brad is smitten. If Alex works with Violette, Hazel offers Alex a coveted spot in her Christmas Eve show. Alex relents. Brad asks Alex to learn about Violette so he can attract her. Alex will keep up the lie, but Brad must pay his tab. As Alex and Violette work on their duet, he learns more about her and falls in love. Will he keep lying for Brad or continue lying to himself?<br/><br/>Brad and Hazel are the stand-out characters in this movie. They are hustlers of the same coin. Hazel is the hard-nosed momma bear for her employees. Brad is a sly fox who skates on charm and wit. Vivian and Alex grow throughout the film, but the script foreshadows their development. So viewers aren't concerned about their relationship. This movie is a delightful entry into the 2024 Countdown to Christmas for holiday music lovers.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Sweet Austrian Holiday",
    "review": "Charlotte took over Dobler Chocolates after her grandmother passed away. Now, Charlotte finds herself fighting city hall. Danube Development wants to tear down the complex and build luxury shops and condos. Charlotte is the final holdout and believes she has two secret weapons to win. Charlotte is a finalist for chocolatier of the year and plans to have her shop listed as a historical landmark. Maya works in Charlotte's store and offers sage advice.<br/><br/>The CEO of Danube, Morgana, reviews the logistics of their latest deal with her assistant, Jules. Jules reports they have the documents for all but one of the properties. Morgana says Charlotte doesn't have the proof to declare her business a landmark, causing Charlotte to lose. She is ready to meet with Gordon, the CEO of Eurostar. He acquired her company after they obtained the lucrative deal. Henry and his right-hand man, Wilfred, arrive. Gordon had a health scare, stepped down, and gave Henry the reigns without telling Morgana. Morgana lies and says everything is going according to plan. Henry tells Morgana he desires a holiday and doesn't want to handle business until the new year.<br/><br/>Henry and Wilfred visit a Christmas market and see Charlotte and Maya at a booth. They unofficially met at a fundraiser, and Maya felt sparks between Henry and Charlotte. She tricks Charlotte into spending time alone with Henry while she gets to know Wilfred better. Henry mentions that he works for Eurostar but doesn't discuss Danube Development. He doesn't know the truth until he sees her paperwork. Against Wilfred's warnings, Henry doesn't tell Charlotte his connection to her strife. Can he find a deal that works for them both without losing Charlotte?<br/><br/>The romance between Maya and Wilfred will keep you watching. Charlotte's resolution won't surprise Hallmarkies because the movie is a typical 'bad developer' story. Morgana is a villain from Disney. All she needed was a cat or a coat made of Dalmatian fur. This film won't interest you and gets lost in the holiday schedule.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Her mom lost the bookstore, can't visit for Christmas, and can't pay for Alex's apartment. Alex meets with Max's sister, Pam, and asks for a job at Pam's catering company.

Max and Alex are young and believe a long-distance relationship will cause too much strain on their careers and personal lives. As they go through triumphs and troubles in their careers, they lean on and lie to each other. However, their lies unravel when Alex and Max are face-to-face. Those moments will make you laugh and cry. The timelapse is well done, necessary, and realistic.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Don't Scream, It's Me",
    "review": "Liz argues with her estranged husband, Officer Jay. They live together but in separate bedrooms. Jay hasn't fixed the dryer. So Liz puts their clothes on a line to dry. Then, a man grabs Liz from behind and tells her not to scream. It's her ex-boyfriend, Drew. Drew broke out of prison. He begs for clothes and food. Liz relents and tells Drew to stay outside momentarily. Liz lies and tells Jay she's too sick to attend work. He wishes her well and leaves.<br/><br/>Liz gives Drew clean clothes and a bowl of cereal. Then, she helps Drew remove the handcuffs while telling him to return to prison. Drew escaped with Wesley, who suffers from stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Wesley killed a guard to escape, and now Drew fears Wesley will murder more. Then, Liz gets a knock at the door, and Drew hides. It's a prison officer. He looks around the home and doesn't find Drew. Liz gets a closer look at the officer's name and sees it's the dead officer's shirt. The man, masquerading as the dead officer, is Wesley. Wesley overpowers Drew and handcuffs him to the refrigerator. Wesley demands Liz assist him, or he will kill Drew.<br/><br/>This movie is wild and funny at the same time. Liz has the worst taste in men. Her commitment to health care won't allow her to kill Wesley when he's down. Instead, she imprisons him, and he lives to keep fighting. Liz and Drew's backstory consistently slows the excitement but offers a compelling look into Liz's thought process. This film has exciting moments, but several flashbacks distract the audience.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
