    "review":"Lizbeth leaves her job at the women's shelter to pick up her daughters, and her stomach drops when her ex-husband, Greg, approaches.  Greg tells her that their custody agreement will end in 19 hours.  Now, his visits will be unsupervised.<br/><br/>The next day, Greg picks up their girls for 48 hours.  On their first night away, Lizbeth tries to call her children.  But no one answers.  When she attempts a pick-up at their school, the teacher says she hasn't seen the girls in days.  Lizbeth calls the police, and they confirm her worst fears.  Greg took their children.  After getting through Greg's shield of denial, Lizbeth proves Greg took their daughters on a one-way trip to Greece, and he doesn't plan on coming back.  She thinks the Hague Convention will be enough.  Over the next two years, Lizbeth will fight a country and Greg for her children and freedom.<br/><br/>There aren't enough glasses of wine to get you through this movie without being moved to tears.  Based on Pieces of Me: Rescuing My Kidnapped Daughters by Lizbeth Meredith, this film covers two years of emotional turmoil for Lizbeth and her two daughters.  In a system plagued with corruption, Lizbeth fights a losing battle.  But Lizbeth's biggest struggle is her daughter's mental state.  Each setback will break your heart and make you yell at the TV.  Don't let the year fool you.  While this happened between 1994 and 1996, it still happens today, and getting children back can be just as complex.  This film is an excellent production with detailed clothing, technology, and laws.  It will be a heartfelt favorite.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After her mom, May, died, Izzy relocates to Mississippi with her husband, Jack, and daughter, Taylor.  However, Izzy has fallen into a depression.  Jack, a former musician, doesn't know how to help Izzy and focuses on work.  For Taylor's first day of school, Jack drops Taylor off and meets Taylor's teacher, Emma.  Jack grew up in this town, and his teachers never looked like Emma.  He trips over his words and flatters Emma.  Later, Emma and Jack run into each other at a coffee shop.  She has sympathy for him and his marital troubles.  She promises to be there for him in his time of need.  They meet again during a run in the woods.  Jack cheats on Izzy with Emma and instantly regrets it.  But he had no idea what he unleashed.  Emma is unhinged, scheming, and extremely dangerous.  She plans to not only end Izzy's life but to become Izzy.<br/><br/>This movie has two redeemable qualities: a cute kid and an intelligent retired cop.  Otherwise, there is no other reason to watch.  With this type of Lifetime film, the plot has a high body count to keep you watching.  But no one dies.  You have no empathy for Jack because he is a horrible husband.  If you want to laugh at a poorly contrived movie, you should watch this one.  Apart from that, don't waste your time.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Alyssa stalks her ex-boyfriend's Facebook page when she can't sleep at night.  Her co-worker, Rachel, tells Alyssa to get over Chuck by going out, having fun, and meeting someone new.  Alyssa is a successful publicist, and their company is hosting an event tonight.<br/><br/>Later, Rachel spots Prince Jack, 6th in line for the throne, walking into the event.  Rachel walks up to Jack and sparks a conversation.  After a moment, Rachel walks Jack over to Alyssa, introduces them, and leaves them alone.  Within 24 hours, Jack calls to go out on a date.  Rachel thinks they will fall in love and have a fairy tale romance.  Only Jack's family and bodyguard, Taffer, know the truth.  Jack is dangerous and must take medication, and without it, he is prone to fits of anger, stalking, and murder.<br/><br/>This movie features one of the best fictional Lifetime heroines of all time.  She is cautious, tenacious, and intelligent.  Before she escapes, she takes off her heels and puts on sneakers.  If the leads' names sound familiar, that's because they are.  These two played in Fit for a Prince, where a woman falls in love with a prince and lives happily ever after.  Consider this film the Lifetime version of a wholesome rom-com that you never knew you wanted.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Olivia works at the Level Ground community center garden.  She sees two men, Brian and Perry, erecting a sign.

Richard wants Brian to meet his fiance's best friend.  Jenny and Olivia walk into the bar, and Brian stutters with disbelief.  They quickly let Jenny and Richard know they are not the right fit for each other and have conflicting interests.  Jenny says they need to put their problems beside because Brian is the best man.<br/><br/>During dinner, Olivia and Brian see Jenny and Richard arguing.  They pull their friends aside.  Jenny and Richard admit to having doubts about getting married.  So they will call a truce to help their friends.  After the wedding, they will be bitter rivals again.  What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie is funnier than most romantic comedies.  Each event to bring the betrothed together gets muddled and forces Olivia and Brian into a romantic environment.  By helping their friends, they see the other's passion and drive to make people better.  Most viewers will figure out the ultimate solution before the first commercial break.  But you will want to watch for their mishaps assisting the bride and groom.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A year ago, Amy promised herself that she would move up in the company or move on.  So when the boss passes her over for a promotion, Amy quits with no job prospects.  Amy tries to determine what to do next when she gets a call from a lawyer.  The lawyer informs Amy that Maria, aka Mama. died, and he will read Mama's will soon.  Mama owned and operated an Italian restaurant with her husband, Roberto.  For years, Amy was the manager of Mama's Ristorante but left to work elsewhere.  Mama and Amy had a falling out afterward.<br/><br/>Before the reading, Amy orders a cannoli and coffee and reads the paper.  A man, Frank, sits next to her because she bought the last cannoli.  Yesterday, a critic came into Frank's restaurant and tried his food.  She said it was lacking an ingredient: Love.  After bothering Amy, she leaves Frank sitting at the cafe with the newspaper and half a cannoli.  Later, Amy sits with the lawyer, and Frank walks into the room.  Amy didn't know that Frank was the head chef at Mama's.  Mama wanted Amy to manage the restaurant and Frank to continue to be the head chef.  Then the lawyer handed Amy Mama's recipe book and money.<br/><br/>When Amy arrives at Mama's, Amy sees the changes Frank made, and she instantly feels out of place.  Amy wants to use the money to redo Mama's back to its original form.  When Amy looks through Mama's book for guidance, she learns that the restaurant will have its 50th anniversary in 14 days.  This date change will push the reopening ahead two weeks, but Amy thinks they can do it.  With all of Amy's changes, Frank feels like there is no place for him at the new Mama's, so he is looking for a job without telling Amy.  With Mama's guidance, Frank and Amy must come to a compromise and find the missing ingredient in each other.<br/><br/>While the plot focuses on the story of Amy and Frank, the love of Maria and Roberto will stay with you.

Amy and Frank's love story is watchable and develops well.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
