    "review": "Kate catches her daughter, Lily, sneaking into the house after spending the evening with Dean. Kate grounds Lily, and Lily is angry. She believes Kate is taking out her fears on her. Ten years ago, someone abducted Kate's other daughter, Emily. The police never found the young girl.<br/><br/>After school, Kate informs Lily that it's her father's weekend. And she told Matt about the punishment and warned him to stick to it. When the phone rings, Kate leaves to answer it, and Lily hears the sound of glass shattering. The police found Emily alive. Officer Bowen offers to give a DNA test, but Kate wants to wait until they get her home.<br/><br/>Emily settles into her home and delights that things look the same, except for Lily's room. As everyone rejoices about Emily's return, Lily sees the kinks in her armor. She gets details about the abduction wrong, develops new allergies, and becomes agitated when people ask probing questions. Lily starts to wonder if Emily is her sister. She warns Kate, but Kate tells Lily to let it go. However, Lily won't allow anyone to stop her from learning the truth, not even a killer.<br/><br/>This film has a classic Lifetime setup. A kidnapped victim returns home, and the elated family refuses a DNA test. So fans know this 'survivor' is hiding something sinister. In Lifetime fashion, the secondary characters drop like flies. The writers pulled you into the story by making everyone act strangely, and the backing track amps up these feelings with mysterious and cryptic music. The twist and several hits to the face are compelling. While the build is standard, the twist is unsurprisingly fun. If fans can get past adults playing teens, you will enjoy this 2-hour reality break.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Cabin Pressure",
    "review": "Flight attendant Nora calls her husband, Daniel, to ensure he grabs their daughter's gift before Jordan sees it. She says her daily mantra and heads to the airport. At the security gate, she runs into the crew - Jerry, Ariel, and Parker. She looks at the flight report and discovers they will be transporting a criminal, Miles, and an air marshal, Dale.<br/><br/>Dale and Miles board the flight first. They have a first-class seat, but Dale sternly requests a change so he can have a better view of the cabin. Nora moves them to row seven. Later, the cabin fills with an unhinged influencer, an entitled first-class passenger, a nervous passenger, a vaper, and an unaccompanied minor.<br/><br/>The crew handles the passengers with ease as Nora gets a text. She deduces it's spam and texts to leave her alone. The person calls and instructs her to go to the bathroom. They want her to poison the drink of the person in row 7. It's Miles. If she doesn't do it, they will murder her daughter. She remembers that Dale changed the seats at the last minute. The only way the caller would know that is if they are on the plane. Can Nora kill to save her daughter's life?<br/><br/>This film has a slow build. The criminal is a person of few words. They call, make a threat, and give instructions. This constant physical and mental movement in a tight area helps build the suspense. Lifetimers will have it narrowed down to 2 choices after uncovering some of the culprit's actions. The reveal should be a twist, but it's not. Your choice is likely correct, and it's easy to determine the puppet master. Let's not forget the funniest TSA agent in a movie. She will live rent-free in your mind.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Not So Perfect Stranger",
    "review": "Ava's therapist encourages her to get over her failed marriage by facing her fears. For weeks, Ava's had nightmares about falling into Niagara Falls. Ava mentions it to her best friend, Ginny, and Ginny is ready to leave. Ginny wants Ava to seize the moment and throw her ring into the water.<br/><br/>Ava and Ginny relax in their cabin and go to the bar. After returning, Ava attempts to sleep but has another nightmare. Ava walks to a bridge, stares at her ring, watches it slip through her fingers, and drops onto the ledge. She climbs over the railing and slips. Wyatt rescues her.<br/><br/>They flirt, and Ava sees his neck is bleeding. She cleans his wounds, applies a bandaid, and writes a smiley face on the bandage. She asks him out for dinner tonight for saving her. He can't come tonight, but Wyatt has time tomorrow. He drives her back to her cabin, and they part.<br/><br/>Wyatt returns home and prepares dinner for his captive, Kirsten. When she invited Thomas to spend the night, Wyatt flew into a rage. Wyatt killed Thomas and kidnapped Kirsten. Until then, he will keep Kirsten in a box and visit her once a day.<br/><br/>Ava and Ginny go on a photo walk near the woods. After Ginny gives Ava upsetting news about her ex-husband, Ava walks away to clear her mind. She sees a man dumping a body into the river. She hides and takes photos. Ava alerts the police that she only saw a silhouette.<br/><br/>Ava and Wyatt go to dinner, and she tells him about the river. Wyatt must take control of this situation. Unfortunately, Ava tells him that she told Ginny about the pictures. Now he must eliminate them and delete the photo to maintain his fantasy life with Kirsten. Who will survive?<br/><br/>This Lifetime film is surprising because Ava makes intelligent decisions. She calls the police, sends locations, and trusts her instincts. This movie has the intensity of a Criminal Minds episode. As a woman begs for her life, Wyatt tells his life story. The backing track speeds up and becomes more ominous. You will feel your pulse race, and your fear grow. The green screen isn't flawless, but it's not too distracting. This movie is for you if you can handle a nail-biting drama.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Joanna wakes in a hospital room after being in a month-long coma. When the doctor lets her guard down, Joanna kills her, steals her white coat, and exits the hospital. Joanna won't let anyone stop her from finding the person who killed her mom: her father, Michael.<br/><br/>Michael privately survived his gunshot wound and charmed a wealthy woman, Tessa, going under the pseudonym Christopher. Christopher and Tessa quickly marry and build their life together. During a party, Tessa answers the door. It's Joanna. Christopher is furious. She gives Tessa the same sob story as Whitney. Tessa isn't as welcoming, but allows Joanna to stay. Christopher pulls Joanna aside and warns her that Tessa isn't a mark. If Christopher isn't in her corner, then Christopher will be in her crosshairs. He agrees to run the scam to get Tessa's money. Will history repeat itself?<br/><br/>This film is a far cry from its predecessor. It's dull, confusing, and annoying. The overall plotline hasn't changed. Then, the story has several timeline jumps. The way these women talk about themselves and other women is disgusting. It's no mistake that a man wrote this. This movie was a waste of time, and it's sad to believe their could be a part three.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Line cook Sophie gushes with pride after her restaurant receives a glowing 4-star review. Her boss, Executive Chef William, gives Sophie a promotion to sous chef. Sophie calls her sister, Abigail, with the terrific news. Abigail's excited but has problems at home. Their father passed away years ago, leaving his Montauk restaurant, The Slack Tide, to his family. Now, the Montauk staple is falling apart, and Abigail considers selling it. Sophie wants to save it, so she asks the restaurant manager, Evelyn, for three weeks off. William negotiates ten days off if Sophie cooks for Evelyn's investor party in Montauk. Sophie agrees and flies to Montauk with Evelyn.<br/><br/>Sophie arrives and finds the state of the establishment unbelievable. She wants to rebrand and buy fresh food. Abigail budges and agrees to get fresh fish at the local market. Sophie races to the market and gets caught in a net. Cam untangles her. Sophie freezes at the sight of her former love interest. He extends his help, but Sophie rejects him, but not his fish. Over the next nine days, Sophie will rediscover her passion for family, food, and love.<br/><br/>While the movie's promotion focuses on Sophie and Cam's love story, the viewers will invest in the sisters' plot. Abigail remained in town and focused on family. Sophie lives her dreams in New York but left everything else behind. Abigail and Sophie have emotionally charged conversations about success, regrets, and respect. And that's their main storyline: Gaining respect for each other's decisions. That plot will resonate with your audience and create a thoughtful conversation among Hallmarkies.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
