    "review": "Julia is the founder of The Hearts of Glee Foundation. She works with her husband, Dr. Peter, and her best friend, Lesley, the head of marketing. Julia presents her global aspirations to potential investors. However, they don't like the foundation's logistics and won't sign the deal. Lesley's husband, Mark, meets them, and they have drinks. Later, Julia looks around and sees Peter stroking the hostess's arm and giving her his phone number. Julia waits to confront Peter at home.<br/><br/>Peter explains that the hostess is an old patient and assures Julia she has nothing to worry about. Julia wants a wild night, but Peter gets an emergency text from the office. Peter leaves, and she follows him. He drives to a hotel, meets Lesley, and kisses her. As Julia's heart breaks, she sees Mark running to the elevators. Julia meets Mark in the parking lot, and they go for coffee to talk about their cheating spouses and their next steps.<br/><br/>Mark wants to confront them head-on. However, Julia believes it's too dangerous and hires a private investigator, Sherman. Sherman gets their spouses' information and confirms that Julia and Mark want the truth. Julia and Mark believe this is the first step in their divorce. However, it will lead to kidnappings, burials, and murder.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of making a bad situation worse. Viewers haven't seen someone dig themselves this far in a hole since the Murdaugh Murders. The audience will notice a strange backtrack selection. While Peter and Lesley hide in a home, Mark and Lesley stand on the front porch. The music is more jovial than nerve-racking. It causes the viewer to laugh rather than sit on the edge of their seat. This film is a slippery slope of wildness and is worth watching.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Anita thanks Perry for fixing things around her home. He has been a great help to her since her husband died four years ago. Anita invites Perry inside to give her daughter, Rose, her birthday gift. Rose is unhappy because Anita won't allow Rose to take a weekend trip with her boyfriend, Trevor. Anita offers to consider it if Trevor shows up for Anita's birthday party. Anita asks Perry how his pregnant wife, Dani, is feeling. He says she is ready to give birth soon.<br/><br/>Rose celebrates her birthday with an uninterested attitude. She calls Trevor to confirm, but he hasn't shown up. Later, he calls Rose and breaks up with her. Rose runs with tears but won't let Anita comfort her. She believes Anita is the reason Trevor ended the relationship. Later, she sneaks out to meet Trevor and rekindle their romance.<br/><br/>Rose attempts to hitchhike but can't find a ride. Then, Perry pulls up and offers to give her a ride to Trevor's. During the ride, Perry says he must stop at home first. He offers to drop Rose off afterward. She agrees. He borrows her phone to call Dani.<br/><br/>Dani greets Rose and invites Rose inside. Dani is unsure about this because the last girl didn't cooperate. Perry reminds Rose that he's doing her a favor. Rose gets comfortable but tries to leave. Dani drugs Rose, and Perry puts Rose in bed. Rose wakes up and believes she can go home. She's wrong. They will kill her if she tries to leave, and they've done it before. Can Anita find Rose, or will Perry keep her forever?<br/><br/>Lifetimers, please breathe. You won't care if Anita rescues Rose because she is a grade-A brat. While she will irritate you, this setup makes Rose the perfect prey. However, the rising action takes too long. Rose's character emotionally drains you and makes you want to change the channel when you have an hour left. This film proves that a character can be so unlikeable that you feel alienated from the script. This movie is pure rage bait for Lifetimers.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Love Moms Club: Nila",
    "review": "Fashion buyer Nila helps her daughter, Mara, prepare for the school play. However, Mara becomes upset and exits. Nila sees a man encouraging his daughter and thinks about her deceased husband, Abdi. She holds back tears and walks into the hallway. She bumps into her friend, Mara's godmother, Tory. They hear Harper scream as they converse. Then, they run into Jo, getting asked out by a teacher. They want some fresh air when a woman calls them the Love Club and asks to take their picture.<br/><br/>Nila gets notifications from a dating app during work. Later, Mara admits she created Nila's profile. She believes Nila will stop being a helicopter parent if she focuses on someone else. Nila sends a message to the Love Club for guidance. Later, Jo, Harper, and Tory believe it's time for Nila to move on and try dating. Nila accepts a match but doesn't know a safe meeting spot. Luckily, the Love Club does. They take her to a local coffee shop but insist Nila needs a wingman to help her out of sticky situations. The Love Club asks the owner, Olly, to care for their friend, and he agrees.<br/><br/>Olly cleans the caf√© when his ex-girlfriend, Ruby, arrives. Her last relationship didn't work out, and now she wants to give their's another try. After Ruby leaves, Olly's brother, Garrett, begs him to forget about Ruby and move on.<br/><br/>After another horrible date, Nila sits with Olly. They commiserate over how their friends and family want them to move on from the past and focus on dating. They wish they had a person to fake date to get their loved ones off their backs. Then, Nila gets an idea. She asks Olly to be her fake boyfriend. He thinks it's ridiculous and turns down her offer. Later, Olly sees Ruby and asks her out. However, she's dating someone else. He wants to make Ruby jealous. So, he texts Nila and takes her offer. Can they handle it when something fake becomes authentic and inspirational?<br/><br/>This fourth installment has a heartfelt foundation with a widow trying to start over with loving friends in her corner. Then, the plot sadly falls into the rom-com tropes. This film differs from the rest because it's funnier than its predecessors. It's charming to see Nila and Olly grow individually. They find a new spark for their art, while Olly connects with Nila and the Love Club. Seeing them grow saves this script from being ordinary and makes it compelling.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Love on the Danube: Love Song",
    "review": "Sarah and her mother, Julia, arrive on the dock before boarding the Emerald Cruise along the Danube River. Julia asks Sarah to leave work behind because Sarah's boss, Tricia, won't stop texting Sarah. Julia reminds Sarah that they are there to celebrate Julia's musical career and party. Sarah promises to have fun but won't turn off her phone.<br/><br/>Sarah searches for WiFi on the boat and catches Jack's attention. He quips at her expense and asks her to let loose before they part ways. Later, they meet and discover they are both traveling with their parents. Jack's father, Andre, has retired with regrets. He wishes he had spent more time with family and wants to recapture that on this trip. Sarah worries that Julia didn't live up to her full potential of becoming a soloist because she became a mother. They realize how much their parents have in common and decide to 'Parent Trap' them. However, it doesn't take long for Julia and Andre to see their children's scheming ways and longing looks. They will reverse 'Parent Trap' their children instead.<br/><br/>On the surface, this movie is predictable, with an overdone plot and conclusion. However, viewers should look deeper. Sarah and Jack represent two people dealing with their past to enjoy now. Jack understands his father's sacrifice and wants to relieve Andre of his guilt. Sarah feels culpable because she believes she held her mother back. This juxtaposition speaks to all working parents. No matter what you do, you are always running uphill. Regardless, your children will love you if they feel loved. This moral is beautifully written and felt.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "I Was Honey Boo Boo",
    "review": "Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson was the youngest child of Mama June and Sugar Bear. She lived with her two sisters, Jessica and Pumpkin, but Alana was the apple in Mama June's eye. Alana was a proud pageant girl. She wanted to do Glitz Pageants, but Mama June couldn't afford them. Alana won her first pageant and, along with Mama June, garnered the attention of a TV scout.<br/><br/>At their second pageant, a scout pulled them aside and asked if they wanted to be on a show called Toddlers and Tiaras. She signs Alana up for the TV show and the Glitz Pageants. Alana has one-on-one sessions with producers while Mama June watches. Alana says her catchphrase, and it takes the nation by storm. Soon, the producers call Mama June to give Alana a reality show called Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Alana feels her mother's acceptance and pride for the first time. She believes everything will be better. However, her family will fall prey to transactional love, emotional abuse, neglect, and addiction with the world watching.<br/><br/>This movie is the first time Alana recounts her life for herself. It's for fans and non-fans of the family and their shows. The producers found actors who could mimic their well-documented accents and mannerisms. Also, Alana's narrations give the film much-needed authenticity. The plot digs into the darkest moments in Alana's life and captures how she felt then and now. It's easy for viewers to see this picture as a takedown of Mama June. However, it's a love letter for Pumpkin. While this film focuses on Alana's life, it's a searing indictment of children in reality. They need more protection and counseling because their parents sign them up for long-term judgment and ridicule that they will never understand. This movie deserves your undivided attention because you will never view reality TV the same.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
