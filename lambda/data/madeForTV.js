    "mtitle":"The Hillside Adoption Scam",
    "review":"Bethany gives her husband, Terrence, encouraging words before heading to work to deal with an unruly client, Kyle. Bethany was a designer for her father before taking over his company after he died. She misses designing and loathes the business side of the company.<br/><br/>After avoiding Kyle's phone calls, Bethany heads home to find Terrence drinking in a dark room. The court had a hearing, and the mother of their adopted son, Gavin, wants Gavin back. They tell Gavin and their daughter, Mila, what will happen in the morning. After returning Gavin to his birth mom, Bethany wants to try to have another baby. Then, they hear a frantic knock at the door. A pregnant woman, Georgia, is running from her boyfriend, Puck. Terrence tells her to go to the back of the house and unlocks the door. Bethany wants to help her, but Terrence wants to turn Georgia over to the police.<br/><br/>Bethany takes Georgia to a hotel as Georgia confesses adoption is her choice for her and her baby. She met with a few couples but couldn't find the right people. Bethany feels like Georgia is a godwink and offers Georgia a place to stay in her home. Soon Bethany hires Georgia as her assistant and takes Georgia to her adoption appointments. Georgia tells Bethany that a potential couple offered to buy her a car, and she wants to take the offer. Bethany wants to adopt the baby and tells Terrence. Georgia wants $30,000 and a car in exchange for her baby. And she wants half the money upfront. Bethany and Terrence agree to her terms and prepare to get their little boy to complete their family. Bethany and Terrence have no idea that Georgia is running a scam, and Georgia isn't alone. She and her team of grifters will kill to get money.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, Bethany's desire for a family makes her desperate and willing to believe anything. This movie covers several hard-hitting topics - adoption, egg donation, infertility, miscarriages, and the toll it takes on families. With adoption being expensive, long, and heartbreaking, families are willing to take shortcuts to circumvent the system. This movie isn't a platform to change these issues, but the plot uses it as a backdrop for a wild storyline. And yes, this plot is crazy. However, everyone learns a valuable lesson in the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Taylor completed step one on her list. She goes home and tells Ms. Thompson that she found her baby and she will be a mother again.

The plot seems straightforward, but it adds one big twist for viewers. Now, Caleb is one of the worst husbands in Lifetime history. He is jealous, all-consuming, and lazy. You will want Taylor to kill Caleb before the movie ends. This film is perfect for viewers with bloodlust.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"My Valentine Crush",
    "review":"Krystal's boyfriend, Xavier, has a business trip on Valentine's day. So, he plans to spend February 13th with Krystal. Krystal's friend, Jasmine, invites Krystal to her single's Valentine's Day party since Krystal will be free. Krystal says no because she doesn't want to be with lonely women complaining about men. Xavier comes over, and they have a passionate evening together, but Xavier doesn't stay the night. Krystal is furious after Xavier leaves her alone again.<br/><br/>Krystal is working when her internet cuts off. She calls the cable company in a panic, and the operator finds a repair person, Darryl, in the neighborhood to help. Krystal can't take her eyes off the handsome man and discovers they when to school together. He repairs her modem, drinks a glass of water, and leaves. Jasmine texts Krystal to come to the party again, and Krystal agrees.<br/><br/>Darryl enters the party with another woman and shocks Krystal. During the party, Krystal goes outside for fresh air, and Darryl follows her. They talk about their hopes and dreams, and Krystal mentions she's a poet who wants to perform. Darryl finds a club with an open mic night and gives Krystal liquid courage to get on stage. Krystal takes Darryl home. They spend the morning eating chicken and waffles at Darryl's favorite restaurant and get an unwelcome visit from Darryl's ex-wife. Then Krystal receives a text from Xavier. He is coming over now with some good news. Krystal pushes Darryl out the door and waits for Xavier. He got the contract and wants to go on a vacation with Krystal to celebrate.<br/><br/>After a crazy trip, Krystal returns unhappy, and Xavier leaves her alone again. She calls Darryl, and they have a passionate night together. A few hours later, Xavier drops by for a quick romp and sees two cups in the sink. Darryl knocks at Krystal's door, and Xavier answers it with her. She introduces Darryl to Xavier as the cable guy, and Xavier blows Darryl off by shutting the door in Darryl's face. Both men end their relationship with Krystal. Krystal has to determine if she wants to choose Xavier or Darryl before losing them both forever.<br/><br/>This movie starts as the typical rom-com with the crappy boyfriend with one foot out the door and a fear of commitment. Finally, it stays serious when Krystal contemplates her future with either man. Darryl's final argument feels unbalanced. He is irate that Krystal let Xavier talk down to him but doesn't acknowledge he let several women openly disrespect Krystal. The script tries to save itself by implying that Darryl had a high school crush on Krystal but doesn't explore the topic again. This movie has a typical setup, complex middle, and a flat ending.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Spring Break Nightmare",
    "review":"Kayla beat her friend, Allie, in a surfing competition. Kayla celebrates with her mother, Michelle, her best friend, Becky, her boyfriend, Nick, Allie, and Allie's friend, Sarah. Allie expresses bitterness, but that subsides when she brings up their upcoming trip. Sarah rented a beach house for spring break and invited Allie and Kayla to come. Michelle inquires why Becky isn't going if Kayla wants to relax. Kayla says Sarah planned the trip, but she will invite Becky to go. Michelle gives Kayla the surfing paperwork and tells Kayla to read it on her vacation.<br/><br/>The girls arrive at the house, change, and go to the beach. While Allie and Kayla surf, Zeke and Dean approach Sarah and Becky. They invite the women to a bonfire that night, and Sarah accepts. After a few drinks, Zeke and Dean want to take them to a tourists-free club. Becky decides she wants to return to the house and lets Kayla know. Kayla decides to go with Becky. During their walk, Becky and Kayla argue and part ways. Two men with mask jump and grab Kayla. Becky fights one of the men, pulls off his ski mask, and sees Dean's face. Dean pushes Becky, and her head violently hits a rock. Zeke and Dean put Kayla into their awaiting van. And they leave.<br/><br/>Michelle calls Kayla and Becky several times, but neither picks up their phone. Michelle and Nick go to the police station to file a missing person's report. Michelle darts past Detective Poulet and finds Sarah in the drunk tank. Michelle and Allie use Sarah's information to track Becky and Kayla's last whereabouts. Michelle finds Kayla's phone, and Allie makes the gruesome discovery of Becky's body. Michelle won't sit idle and wait for the police. She searches for Kayla until the kidnappers call with demands. They want Michelle to leave town without contacting the police, or they will kill Kayla. Now, Michelle has to search for Kayla under the radar before they kill Kayla.<br/><br/>Experienced Lifetime viewers will have a sneaking suspicion that there is more to this story than meets the eye. And you are right. Someone in Kayla's orbit has a dastardly plan. This plot performs a magician's trick and diverts your attention to another suspect and a host of shifty characters. This movie's backing track packs the same excitement as the script but sometimes drowns out the conversations. This movie is a fun ride with a slightly predictable ending.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sky talks to the dead to help her clients connect to their deceased loved ones. Her friend, Jessie, monitors her vitals during the session while Randy records them for their website. Her boyfriend, Greg, finds the clients, books appointments, and help gets the room ready. Sky tells Greg she doesn't want to do them anymore because the last spirit almost touched her.<br/><br/>Greg calls a meeting. Sky believes it's for her to tell the team she's quitting. However, Greg found a new client for $20,000. The client is Emma. Four people broke into Emma's home and killed her daughter, son, and husband a year ago. They brutally beat Emma and cut off her finger. She wrote a book about her family and her life after the invasion. Furious, Sky leaves the table because she feels Greg is making her the bad guy if she says no. Sky goes home and hears her mother exchange sexual favors for money to make the rent payment. So Sky calls Greg and tells him to make Emma's appointment.<br/><br/>They meet Emma's sister-in-law, Ashley, at the door. Emma gingerly descends the stairs and offers the group her dining room to prepare. The house, not surprisingly, has top-notch security. Emma walks Sky around the house to tell Sky more about her family.<br/><br/>Afterward, Jessie hooks Sky to the monitor, and Sky starts the reading. The reading starts to get intense, so Emma leaves the room. Sky begins the reading again, but something changes. Jessie sees veins bulge from Sky's face, Sky's blood pressure elevates drastically, and her temperature goes up. When Sky sings the song that played during Emma's invasion, Emma gets up and turns on her security system. All the doors and windows lock, and Emma won't let them out. Emma wants to know the truth about Sky's reading, even if it kills them.<br/><br/>OMG, this movie is superb and worth a second look. It's as funny as it is scary. As the antagonist paces the house, they give a monologue worthy of a comedy night stage. The plot has plenty of jump scares, near misses, and brutal deaths to keep you watching. The backing track will make your heart beat faster and pull you into the action sequences. The fight scenes are well-timed and perfectly choreographed. And the special effects makeup enriched the plot with realistic bruises and blood. Watch this movie until the end, because one look will make you question everything you just saw.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
