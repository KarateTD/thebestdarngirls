    "mtitle": "Give Me Back My Daughter",
    "review": "Renee rehearses talking points for her boss, Richard, before work because a management position has opened up, and she believes she's perfect for the role. She drops off her daughter, Imani, at school and goes to work. Renee meets with Richard and starts her speech. He cuts her off and sadly informs Renee that she is a victim of downsizing. For months, Renee and Imani lived in Renee's car while she looked for work, and Imani attended school.<br/><br/>Renee gets an interview but must pick Imani up from school early. Latoya agrees to childcare but isn't home when Renee arrives. With 30 minutes until the interview, Renee drives to the workplace. She considers bringing Imani inside but recalls a past incident. The interviewer canceled when he saw Imani in the waiting room. Renee doesn't want to lose this job opportunity, so she tells Imani to stay in the car. Renee leaves the interview on cloud nine until she sees police officers surrounding her vehicle. Someone saw Imani alone in the car during cold weather and called the police. They take Imani and arrest Renee. Renee must thrive and get Imani out of foster care. Can Renee succeed?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual stories, Renee faces a cascade of hardship. The script takes time to explain Renee's situation so the audience doesn't solely place blame on Renee. While being away from Imani is traumatic, Renee uses the time properly to regroup and rethink her perspective. This film displays the holes in the system while showing perseverance through adversity with astounding acting and different problematic origins. The conclusion doesn't put a pretty bow on Renee's life but ends honestly.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secrets in the Foundation",
    "review": "Elena moves into her new home with her daughter, Sadie, and father-in-law, Jim. The family unpacks, and Sadie finds her room. She hears footsteps and calls out to Elena. Elena doesn't answer. Sadie asks why Elena didn't respond, and Elena says she was downstairs. Sadie swears the footsteps were her mom's, but Elena blames it on the old house. Later, Jim says he also hears noises but thinks it's rats. Elena promises to call an exterminator.<br/><br/>Sadie attends her first day at her new school. She becomes a pariah when her classmates learn she lives in the 'ghost house.' Sadie runs home to confront Elena. Elena warns Sadie that every home has had a death, so she shouldn't listen to gossip. She implores Sadie to relax and adjust to their new home. When the exterminator can't find rats, Elena worries that Sadie may be right. Can they find the secrets in the foundation before someone dies?<br/><br/>This movie starts as a mystery but foreshadows the culprit in the home's history lesson. Viewers will deduce what's happening, who's doing it, and why. Afterward, the film loses its luster and falls into the Lifetime clich√©s. One thought-provoking moment is when Elena explains why she didn't verbally agree with Sadie, despite thinking that Sadie was correct. The film has a low body count, but the death shocks the audience. This movie is watchable until the mystery is gone.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Fit for Murder",
    "review": "Police Detectives Wilson and Mogg drive to the middle of the Las Vegas desert because, earlier, someone reported a car engulfed in flames. They open the trunk and find a body that's bound and gagged. They use the license plate to uncover the owner, fitness competitor Kelly Ryan. The officers believe Kelly is in the trunk and cringe at telling Kelly's husband, bodybuilder Craig Titus. When the officers knock on the door, Kelly answers. Kelly tells them that her former assistant, Melissa James, stole the car and could be the woman inside. Kelly and Craig's story doesn't sit well with Wilson and Mogg. So, they ask the fitness icons to come to the station for more questioning. Officers will find a dark side to the fitness world that involves sex, drugs, and money.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this non-linear movie follows Craig and Kelly from their first meeting with Melissa to their sad ending. The writers didn't try to make anyone look 'good' by excluding their part in Melissa's death. All three people involved had detrimental flaws. The financial problems don't help the troubled situation. The writing overcomes the film's budget, but it's not as salacious as other Lifetime 'true crime' films. Now, the storytelling can be off-putting for some. The non-linear format helps viewers see the crime from the detectives' point of view.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Hearts Around the Table: Shari's Second Act",
    "review": "Shari's loving family greets her as she returns to Maryland after divorcing her husband, David. Her foster mother, Angie, is happy to have Shari back at the house, but she informs Angie that she won't stay long. A co-op owner approved Shari's application. It comes with an apartment, and Shari has her first portrait commission.<br/><br/>Shari enters her new space, flicks the light switch, and sees sparks. The handyman, Evan, enters and offers to fix it. He repairs it before Shari heads to Sunday supper with her family. During supper, Shari calls Evan handsome, and they all take notice.<br/><br/>Later, Shari and Evan spend time together while she buys art supplies. Later, she discovers Evan owns the co-op building. He wants to create a studio space for artists to show their work. However, he needs help. Shari offers sound advice. Over the coming weeks, Shari has spent more time on Evan's work than on her art. And she hasn't found inspiration for her painting. She worries that she's repeating the mistakes from her first marriage by putting Evan's needs before her art. Her family echoes her fears. In Shari's second act, will she get a second chance at love or error?<br/><br/>This movie follows Shari after her divorce. Shari's ex-husband, David, is a diplomat. She lived the 'high life' but felt that David didn't care about her passions. Shari moves and focuses on regaining her self-worth. It's that story that will resonate with Hallmark fans. Although the conclusion is foreseeable, you will watch until the end to see how Shari and Evan work out their differences. And the subplot between Josh and his player, Kyle, will break and melt your heart. This sequel is better than its predecessor and gives viewers something to look forward to in the next two movies.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Wife Stalker",
    "review": "Joanna examines her husband's attire. Leo informs Joanna that he must meet a character witness, Piper, at Piper's studio and dress like a student. Joanna laughs and asks him to come home early for a surprise.<br/><br/>Joanna's mother doesn't hide her distrust for Leo while Joanna sings his praises. She knows Leo had issues six months ago, but now he's improving. Their marriage is on an upswing.<br/><br/>Leo meets with Piper after class. She gives his background information on his client's therapy sessions and offers Leo a discount on her services. Leo laughs. When Leo leaves, Piper looks him up online with a growing fascination. Leo arrives home, and Joanna has created a menu for their party. Leo agrees to the event and invites Piper.<br/><br/>When Piper arrives at the party, Leo admits to Piper that things have been difficult for their family. Joanna sees Piper and Leo quietly talking and worries they are too close. Days after the party, Joanna works to regain Leo's attention. However, he's going out to meet a client. To Joanna's surprise, it's Piper. Leo returns home to find Joanna sleeping, but she's faking. She knows Leo slept with Piper after dinner.<br/><br/>Joanna leaves to care for her mother after a bad fall. Leo arrives and asks to end their relationship. He is in love with Piper and wants to get married. Joanna follows Piper on a trail and hears a man, Brent, call her Pamela. Brent explains that he knew Piper as Pamela years ago. She stole Matthew from Ava and married Matthew within months. However, Matthew and his daughter, Mia, died in a sailing accident. The police never arrested Pamela. Joanna worries Piper will repeat her actions, and Leo and their children will die. She will stop at nothing to save her family and marriage.<br/><br/>Based on Wife Stalker by Liv Constantine, this movie deserves a part two. The beginning will give you three archetypes: the begging wife, the cold husband, and the scandalous mistress. As the plot digs into Piper's past, you will worry for the children. The climax has Piper staring down the barrel of a gun. However, the audience has no idea where the conclusion will lead. The viewers will fall in love with the acting on their 2nd watch. You will notice missed cues and varying chemistry. This movie is the film Lifetime fans deserve.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
