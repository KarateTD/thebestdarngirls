    "review":"In 1985, at Queensborough Community College, Sandy walked in for spades and asked Cheryl if she knew how to play.  Cheryl turned down Sandy's offer because handing out Sears applications were her focus. A week later, Sandy walks into the call room and gets a seat next to Cheryl, and Cheryl introduces her to several teammates. At home, Cheryl's boyfriend, Herbie, wants to make a response-diss rap for The Show like Roxanne's Revenge did for Roxanne.  He believes the rap will put them on the map, especially if they do it as an Ashford and Simpson duet.  Herbie gets in the studio with Cheryl, but their voices don't sound good together.  So he gets an idea, they need another girl.  Cheryl remembers Sandy. Within six weeks, their song, The Showstoppers, is on the radio and in heavy rotation.  Promoters hire them at local clubs, bars, and high schools to perform.  Fans are calling them Salt-N-Pepa because of a line in the song.  Herbie decides that Cheryl will be Salt, and Sandy will be Pepa. They get a DJ called Spinderella and record their first album.  With the song Push It, they become household names but boyfriends, money, self-mutilation, eating disorders, partying, legal disputes, faith, and arguments over significance become dominant hurdles in the group.  After the dust settles, will there be a Salt-N-Pepa?<br/><br/>With some so-so casting and lack of Spinderella, the movie gets off to a bumpy start.  However, the plot discusses the personal fallout of the group as its popularity rises.  That's when the story gets real.  The women claim they are better at solving other people's problems than theirs.  And that rings true during their friendship. Cheryl starts to have a crisis of faith, while Sandy's is money. But through a male-dominated industry, their biggest opponents were themselves and each other.  So, sit back, enjoy this movie, and learn.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Wrong Prince Charming",
    "review":"Anna works hard as the lead legal counsel and vice president of Davis Real Estate.  Her boss, Bridget, walks into the conference room with an exciting announcement, Prince Edward of Devonshire wants to invest in their property.  So Bridget scheduled a meeting with Prince Edward and the controller of Devonshire holdings, Liam. At the meeting, Edward and Liam inform Bridget and Anna that they will invest $300 million into the project, but first, Davis Real Estate has to put $30 million in an escrow account to trigger a loss and avoid taxes. After the meeting, Anna meets with her best friend, Heather, for coffee, and Mia approaches them.  Mia warns Anna that Prince Edward isn't who he says he is and leaves her business card. The next day, Anna tells Bridget that she finished the paperwork and everything looks good.  Bridget sets up another appointment for Anna to be with Edward alone. Edward is more concerned with Anna than the numbers, but he guarantees the deal is as good as done.  That's because the agreement is fake.  Edward and Liam are con-artists.  They stole $200,000 from Mia and moved on for a bigger payday.  It will take a slip of the tongue, two missing people, and a concerned step-sister to bring Edward and Liam's deceitful ways to light.<br/><br/>So two lessons come from this movie.  First, pay attention to internet articles.  And second, never try to dodge Uncle Sam.  At first, it's easy to give up on this movie because you believe you know the setup.  However, the mouse becomes the cat and vice versa. And that's when things get interesting.  You will be sucked in and want a part two after the credits roll.  And yes, you do get the classic line.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Dr. Zee and Britt arrive at the Winchester Gallery to pick up a painting donated to their auction.  Inside, Zee sees Bernadette on the floor in a pool of blood. Zee observes that Bernadette is dead.  When Chief Madieras arrives to look over the crime scene, Jeff notices a statue is missing.  They believe finding the sculpture is the key to unlocking the murderer.  Zee goes with Jeff to investigate Bernadette's co-workers and friends for potential enemies.  They question Bernadette's co-worker, Lila, first because she was Bernadette's last call.  Then, the Chief and Jeff interview Bernadette's husband, Derrick, because their marriage hit a bad patch. Later, Zee and Jeff talk to Carl; he created the missing sculpture and was having an affair with Bernadette.  Finally, the chief and Jeff interview Suzanne because Jeff saw her offer double for the artwork before it was missing.  This tale will lead Zee and Jeff on unconventional and unknown dates, canceled plans, and life-saving technology.<br/><br/>Based on Martha's Vineyard Mystery book series, this movie has twists and turns that gives itself away.  The killer will be predictable for experience Hallmarkies but the why is not. Another reason to watch, seeing Jeff and Zee unveil another layer to the 'who shot him' mystery.  It's a great link in the chain to the ultimate enigma of this series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Justin finished his rehab, and he is prepared to get back on his skis, but his coach doesn't believe he is ready.  Justin wants to defend his title and make a comeback to prove to the world and sponsors that he has the goods.  Since he can't get his coach to work with him, his manager, Anna, tells Justin to go back to his parents' ski lodge, Winter Mountain, and train before the Winter Classic. On his first practice run, Justin falls and sees a ghost from his past, Kayla.  Kayla coached Justin through his first Winter Classic, so he has an idea to have Kayla be his coach.  She worries that Justin cares more about notoriety than the sport, but he promises to follow her lead.  With younger competition on his heels, can Justin focus on the task at hand while falling for Kayla?<br/><br/>Based on Sleigh Bells in the Snow by Sarah Morgan, this movie doesn't capture your attention.  You will focus more on the relationship between Justin and Kayla's friends instead of theirs.  Even the comic relief of Anna isn't enough to keep you mentally tuned in to the film.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
