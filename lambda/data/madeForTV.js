    "mtitle":"Murdaugh Murders: The Movie - Part 1",
    "review":"Alex Murdaugh charms the room as his father, Randolph, and wife, Maggie, proudly watch. Randolph calls Alex into his office for an update and a scolding. Alex and Buster slowly jeopardize the family legacy. Alex assures Randolph the law practice is in good hands and the name will carry on into the future.<br/><br/>Alex gladly takes personal injury cases and gives clients loans until they get a settlement. Alex and Maggie beam as they present their youngest son, Paul, with a truck. Their housekeeper, Gloria, thinks they spoil Paul, but Alex tells her to stay out of it. Then, Alex gets a call in the middle of the night. The police pulled over Paul for drinking and put him inside a holding cell. Alex uses his influence to get Paul out without a charge. Paul promises not to drink again.<br/><br/>Alex has a late-night meeting and overhears Paul with Anthony and Connor in his office. Alex wants an explanation, but Paul pulls out oxycodone instead. Paul found Alex's secret stash. And they promise to keep their addictions from Maggie.<br/><br/>Then, Alex drives home to find Gloria on his front steps with a bleeding head wound. She remains in a coma but succumbs to her injuries. Alex takes more pills and bounces checks around town. Then, Alex gets a call in the middle of the night. Paul and his friends were in a boating accident. Mallory is missing, and Alex's world is on fire.<br/><br/>This movie is from Alex's point of view. So it dedicates only 5 minutes to the boating accident. However, the script holds nothing back from the murders of Paul and Maggie. This plot sets up Alex's crimes and motivation for murdering his family. Also, it displays Maggie as a kind woman with zero faults. Each actor shined in their perspective roles. Part two will focus on the trial and any lies in this film.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Curious Caterer: Fatal Vows",
    "review":"Goldy and Marla prepare a 7-tier wedding cake for their most demanding bride ever, Jessamyn. Goldy offers bison sliders to Jessamyn's guests and congratulates the bride at the rehearsal dinner. Goldy walks over to the groom-to-be, Sterling. She laughs at Sterling's charming personality, but he admits he can't dazzle everyone, especially his future brother-in-law, Hunter. Then, Goldy sees the maid of honor, Katy, across the room. Katy dated Sterling, but the relationship didn't last. Then, she met Sterling's best friend, Ray. Now, Katy and Ray are in love and thinking about the future.<br/><br/>Jessamyn's business partner, Chester, and Sterling quarrel on the other side of the room about Jessamyn's real estate company. Tom congratulates his ex-wife, Jessamyn, on her wedding and finds Goldy. Sterling gets drunk and flirts with Katy. Ray comes over to defend her, and Sterling breaks a glass to harm Ray. Tom steps in between them, and Sterling cuts Tom by accident. Sterling exits, and Goldy tends to Tom's cut.<br/><br/>Goldy and Marla are abuzz for the wedding and feverishly prep. Marla discovered Sterling's body face down in the fountain. Goldy calls Tom to investigate and tells someone to alert Jessamyn. Tom and Mason notice that Ray has a hand injury and Chester has a black eye. Then, Goldy hears that Jessamyn is missing. The sheriff cuts Tom's investigation short when they find Tom's blood at the scene. Detective Dave Trach will take over the case. Tom secretly works with Goldy until Trach comes to Goldy's home. He discovers the beneficiary of Jessamyn's life insurance is Tom and makes Tom his number 1 suspect. Can Goldy find Sterling's killer and Jessamyn's location before Trach charges Tom with the crimes?<br/><br/>Wow! This dinner has more drama in 15 minutes than most movies in 2 hours. Sterling has issues with Jessamyn, Ray, Katy, Chester, and Hunter. Also, he still pays for his father's misgivings. Unlike most Curious Caterer films, this movie has two mysteries to solve with Goldy's love interest in the crosshairs. Based on The Last Suppers by Diane Mott Davidson, this film provides a gripping mystery until a witness says one word. So bake some Snickerdoodle muffins and enjoy the next installment of the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secrets at the Museum",
    "review":"Natalie poses for Alex while he paints her portrait before receiving a phone call. Her father, Robert Freeman, survived a heart attack. Luckily, he wore his life-saving medicine pendant and took the pills in time. She retreats to see her dad without Alex because she doesn't want Alex to know she is heir to the Freeman Museum.<br/><br/>Robert delights in his daughter's presence and apologizes for his poor parenting. Natalie returns to the museum to help steer the ship while her father gets better. Robert introduces Natalie to his curator, Derek, security, Tina, and appraiser, Danielle. Danielle pulls Robert aside during an exhibit because one of his paintings is a forgery. Astounded, Robert asks Danielle to send proof and pulls the painting off the wall. Robert carefully walks to his office and has a heart attack. Robert dies, and the media picks up the story.<br/><br/>Natalie runs the museum but can't get Alex to talk on the phone. Alex is upset to learn Natalie is a Freeman. He leaves her portrait behind and skips town. Danielle informs Natalie that several of their paintings are fake. Natalie takes down a potential fake to examine it and puts Alex's portrait of her in its place. Natalie looks at photos from the last showing and spots her dad wearing his pendant. But he wasn't wearing it at the time of his heart attack. She believes there is more to her father's death. Natalie must find the truth behind the lies before she loses her legacy and life.<br/><br/>This film is a mystery that doesn't require your full attention. The plot foreshadows enough events to let you piece everything together before Natalie. Unfortunately, the script paints Alex as a whiner. She lied during their entire relationship about her past but tries to pretend it's not a big deal. This movie is perfect for a busy day with momentary lulls.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Venice Murders",
    "review":"Celia leaves the U.S. to restart her life and attend an art school in Italy. She waits for a water taxi as Matteo walks toward her. He is the cultural liaison for the school, and he knows a better way to get there. They part at the school, and Celia finds her room. Celia unpacks, and her hallway neighbor, Evie, introduces herself. They spend the next four days in and out of the classroom.<br/><br/>Evie invites Celia to tour Italy and brings a surprise, Matteo. Matteo wants to go off the beaten path to find hotspots, not in a guidebook. Matteo goes far from campus and brings the women to an unmarked restaurant with Chef Dante. Evie leaves because she feels like a third wheel. Matteo and Celia try to find Evie but can't. So, Celia believes she made it to school until Evie doesn't attend class.<br/><br/>Celia and Matteo look for Evie until Celia gets a call from the police. Celia turns around to update Matteo, but he is gone. The inspector informs Celia that Evie is an heiress and maybe an abduction victim. The dean informs Celia that the school doesn't have a liaison and no 'Matteo' works there. Celia knows Matteo has Evie, and she feels responsible. The inspector tells Celia to let them handle it because the kidnappers will likely call for a ransom. But Celia won't wait. She will do everything to save Evie.<br/><br/>Does this movie sound exciting? If you answered yes, then this synopsis did its job too well. If it doesn't, then you watched the movie. This film gives viewers little sympathy for Evie or Celia. Evie has zero street smarts, and Celia is too trusting of a stranger with an accent. Then, the subplot of battling sisters isn't worth mentioning because it was completely unnecessary. If you find yourself cheering for the kidnappers, don't feel bad.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sweet as Maple Syrup",
    "review":"Rachelle reports this year's sap yield to her brother, business partner Steven. Sadly, their maple trees, including Big Bertha, haven't produced sap. And the annual Beaumont Maple Festival, started by their parents, counts on them. Steven tells Rachelle that he called an arborist from Arizona to help.<br/><br/>Rachelle goes to her friend's diner for breakfast and overhears a man ordering pancakes with table syrup. Derek prefers it over maple syrup because it's sweeter. Rachelle mildly condemns him and leaves to meet with Steven. When Steven brings up the scientist again, Rachelle desires to retreat, but it's too late. He's there, and it's Derek. She discovers that he doesn't have any real-world understanding. However, he convinces Rachelle to let him take a few samples to test. He is determined to have the sap running by the festival. Rachelle believes she can do it without him but takes the help. Their partnership will span beyond the forest.<br/><br/>The movie tries to grab your attention but is dull and slow. The couple has chemistry, but you don't care because you know how the relationship will end. The shining light of this film is Betty, the town matchmaker. She is a scene-stealer and the perfect comic relief.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
