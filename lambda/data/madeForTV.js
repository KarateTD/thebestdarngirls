    "review":"Paul brings Ruby and her daughter, Pearl, to his sprawling estate called Cypress Woods.  Inside, Ruby sees a proposal written with rose petals.  She loves Paul but says no because they are half-siblings.  Paul doesn't care, and the town doesn't know their history. With sadness and regret, Ruby turns him down and heads back to her family home on the bayou.  She hopes to make a living like her grandmère, by selling goods, until Buster comes to collect what her grandpère promised.  Ruby attacks Buster, grabs Pearl, and elopes to marry Paul.  Now, Ruby and Paul reside together but in separate bedrooms. Everything goes well until Giselle blows into town with news. Beau broke off his engagement to his Parisian heiress, and Giselle wants to help him.  The information leaves Ruby in pure shock and confusion. Then she gets a letter from Giselle detailing how she and Beau are married. Ruby attempts to forget Giselle and Beau until she gets a call that her step-mother, Daphne, died.  Now Giselle and Ruby must work together to keep the money away from Daphne's late husband, Bruce.  After meeting, Beau invites Ruby to his private loft in the French Quarters for a romantic affair, and she can't say no.  Afterwards, Ruby comes home to a devastated Paul. Seeing Paul's suffering, Ruby agrees to stop seeing Beau. Days later, Ruby gets a call that Giselle fell ill after a mosquito bite, and she won't get better.  Beau says they have a second chance because no one knows Giselle is sick.  Ruby can switch places with her twin, and they can have a life together with Pearl as one big happy family. Paul agrees to the swap.  Ruby plays the part of the viper-tongued Giselle in public and Ruby in private.  After a suicide, Ruby's secrets come back to haunt her, and she could lose Pearl in a custody war.<br/><br/>Based on All that Glitters, this installment gives you V.C. Andrews' twists and turns with a wild twin swap.  Seeing Ruby slip into Giselle's vitriol comments like a glove is disturbing as it is entertaining. Playing Giselle, Ruby feels strong and in control. But with great power comes great responsibility and treachery.  Let's hope the fourth installment keeps the drama coming.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Giselle and Ruby head to the Greenwood School for Girls, run by Mrs. Ironwood, for boarding school.  While Ruby is excited, Giselle is bored. Later, Abby walks into the room, and everyone notices she is slightly darker than the other girls.  But Ruby jumps at the chance to make Abby her roommate. Mrs. Ironwood lets Ruby know she will keep a close eye on her because she thinks bayou girls are low-class and promiscuous.  Ruby airs her frustration to Abby, and Abby can relate.  Abby reveals that her skin color is not a tan but a result of her mixed heritage.  Mrs. Ironwood looks down on her too.  A few days later, Mrs. Clairborne, the school's benefactor, invites the girls to her home. As Ruby eyes the priceless paintings, she hears a piano playing.  Ruby walks into a room and meets Louis Clairborne, Mrs. Clairborne's blind grandson. Later Ruby's reprimanded for walking throughout Mrs. Clairborne's home, but she doesn't understand why everyone is upset about it.  Ruby's art teacher, Miss Stevens, tells her the rumor.  Louis's father caught his mother with a younger man and killed her.  Then, he killed himself, and Louis witnessed it all.  The trauma caused Louis to go blind. With her family and headmistress plotting against her, Ruby will witness a so-called Christmas miracle, give the gift of sight, and have a Pearl in the midst of it all.<br/><br/>Based on Pearl in the Mist, this movie picks up where the first one left off.  While it covers the know V.C. Andrews' topics, the plot handles prejudice and abortion.  The second installment is entertaining, but it falls into the trap of most second installments. The first story was about Ruby fitting in with her new family, but it's hard to figure out the main point of this film.  However, the plot adds new characters and expands current character's roles and motivations.  Let's hope the third installment picks up.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Travis travels back to Chicago to testify in the Wolfman trial, and he runs into his ex-wife, Kate.  She is a little shocked to hear that he still resides in Garrison, but she is happy for Travis.  After Travis testifies, the Wolfman escapes the courthouse.  Knowing his part of the trial is done, Travis leaves Chicago and heads back to Garrison.

And as the story ends, you get one more mystery for the next installment.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After preventing World War three between two high-strung clients, Sophie feels disconnected from her interior design company. Her business partner, Spencer, suggests she take a break, disconnect, and come back with a sense of rejuvenation.  Sophie's not sure if she can do it until she gets inspiration from one of her grandmother's paintings.  The painting always inspired her at work, but on the reverse side, it said Summerside.  Before she checks into the Summerside AirBnB, Sophie stops at a local café.  She talks to a girl named Kailey.  Sophie explains to Kailey what she does for a living, why she is in town, and what a digital detox is. Then, Sophie sees a cute guy waving at the window.  Sophie believes the man is waving at her, but he is Kailey's dad, Michael. She goes inside the main house and finds Michael inside.  He is the owner of the Airbnb.  She gives Michael the picture, and Michael explains the woman is his late wife. Sophie spends her time painting, connecting to her grandmother, and getting to know the people of Summerside.  Talking to the townspeople, Sophie learns the AirBnB was the place for all the local events.  However, Michael stops hosting the parties after his wife died. When Michael finds a picture of Sophie's grandmother at the summer solstice, Sophie gets an idea.  Since the summer solstice festival helped her grandmother find her inspiration to paint, Sophie will help Michael plan and host the next event. She promises to stay.  But when she has to break her promise, a purple bean bag chair will reveal her true feelings.<br/><br/>This film is the typical \"woman leaves her job to find inner peace but finds love\" story.  All this movie needs is a Christmas tree, and you will have a Hallmark holiday movie. Kailey recognized that Michael and Sophie would make a great couple. So, she uses her tween ways to usher them into love.  Love at Sunset Terrace is a good movie if you need an easy watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amy took the bull by the horns and asked her boss, Camella, for the nature photographer job. If she does well, Camella will promote Amy to the principal photographer position for Explorer Global Magazine.  Amy checks into the lodge and meets Mark North, one of the hotel's tour guides, on the trail. Amy attempts to walk back to the hotel but gets lost again and runs into Mark, his daughter, Kyra, and the tour group.  Mark invites her on the tour so Amy can make it back to the hotel.  On the hike, Kyra and Amy make a connection because they love taking photos. Mark believes each waterfall has a distinct personality and should be protected.  So Mark doesn't like taking people to see them if they are going to pin their location.  By pinning the spot, people will travel for selfies and pollute the area with trash.  Amy asks him to show her directions to the falls, but she promises not to give their location.  However, Camella didn't make that promise.  When Mark loses his trust in Amy, will it ruin their budding romance?<br/><br/>While the love story is nice, you will be more interested in Amy's connection to Kyra.  Amy helps guide Kyra during one of the most trying times in a young girl's life. Amy not only solidifies her external beauty, but she acknowledges Kyra's internal beauty too.  Seeing Amy bond with and guide Kyra makes you want Amy and Mark to be a couple.  With beautiful cinematography, although some looked green screen, this will become a favorite for Hallmarkies.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
