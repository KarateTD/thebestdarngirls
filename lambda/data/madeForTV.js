A day later, Mo drives Krissy to school, and Krissy asks to go to a party. Mo says no because it's too far, and she doesn't know the boy's parents.

    "review":"Casey's friends, PJ and Sara, tell Casey to skip class today, but District Attorney Intern Casey needs it to forget her hardships. Casey's brother, Marcus, waits for the jury to decide his case. Police arrested Marcus, and the district attorney charged him with 2nd-degree murder for killing Davina. During class, Public Defender Intern Eli slyly brings up Marcus's case in class, and they argue. Afterward, Professor Ambrose releases her students but asks Eli and Casey to stay. Professor Ambrose understands both students are hurting. Casey worries about Marcus, and Eli was in a long-term relationship with Davina before she died. Later, Casey gets a phone call from the public defender because the jury reached its decision.<br/><br/>PJ and Sara go with Casey to the courthouse for support, and Eli comes to comfort Davina's father, Frank. The jury finds Marcus guilty and sentences him to life without parole. When Casey steps outside the courthouse, Casey pulls PJ and Sara aside to talk about appeals. PJ and Sara need discovery from the crime scene because the case is over.<br/><br/>They go through the discovery and uncover that the police only tested the necklace for fingerprints. PJ and Sarah know the police should have collected evidence on and around Davina's body. They need the evidence from the scene before the police burn it or give it to Frank. They need to intercept it. But the only person who can do this is Eli. With the help of their friend, Private Investigator Liam, these Justice Warriors will turn the wheels of justice and find out who killed Davina.<br/><br/>This new series is off to a powerful start. Everyone has a specialty to help Casey crack the case. Also, it's delightful to see Hallmark veterans pass the torch to newcomers with a compelling and thought-provoking mystery. This film asks daring questions about the American justice system and every one playing a role within it. This movie is entertaining and stimulating.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jordan feels overwhelmed at work and home. Her new boss, Tara, requests several meetings and increases Jordan's workload while expecting Jordan to maintain her productivity. Jordan's boyfriend, Peter, wants to get married, but Jordan isn't ready. After her father's death, Jordan's mother, Suzanne, moved in with Jordan. Jordan has difficulty with simple decisions because she second-guesses the big ones.<br/><br/>Jordan stands before a barista and can't decide what she wants. A woman behind her, Liz, asks Jordan a few questions and suggests something. Jordan happily takes Liz's advice and sits with her order. Liz joins Jordan and introduces herself as a certified life coach. She believes she can help Jordan get her life on track. After Jordan hits a wall, she hires Liz. Jordan believes this will be a new start to an abundant and take-charge life. But Liz can't wait to wedge herself into Jordan's world and tear it apart.<br/><br/>While the motive is unoriginal, the plot and acting are fantastic. Liz doesn't hide her crazy from the audience, and the viewers will cheer her on. Jordan does need help. Her aversion to conflict makes it easier for Liz to intrude on Jordan's life. This movie has everything Lifetimers want, need, and expect from this network. It has a solid body count, pearl-clutching moments, and an intriguing antagonist. Don't miss this delightful addition to The Wrong franchise.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lea thanks her best friend, Carl, for getting her an interview with Selina at Wade Coleman Publishing. Before going to the interview, Lea runs to a bookstore for inspiration. She sees a man, Michael, arrange the books. She assumes he works there and asks for recommendations. He suggests Mountain Pacific, but Lea says the book's theme is too heavy. She prefers romantic novels like the one recently written by Rose Blossom. He walks away.<br/><br/>Michael signs copies of his book for fans. A fan congratulates him on his literary award nomination. Michael runs into Selina's office and sees Lea sitting there. Lea excuses herself because the interview was awful. Michael explains that he was unknowingly nominated twice for the award. Michael is Rose Blossom. He said romantic novels were mindless dribble, and anyone could write one. So, Selina challenged him to craft a book with the pseudonym Rose Blossom. The book was a smash hit. However, if people discover he wrote it, they will label him a hypocrite. Michael tells Selina to get an actress to be Rose. Then, Lea walks in to retrieve a forgotten item. Selina suggests Lea become Rose. Lea comes up with terms and conditions. Selina agrees that Lea will get a full-time position if she plays Rose. But only if Michael helps coach her. They all agree to keep the lie until the ceremony. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Michael looks down on books that have the same plot as this movie. So, viewers feel silly for watching it. Also, nothing about the plot grabs your attention until Carl is on the screen. Selina has her boss moments and keeps Michael in check. However, the leads are unlikable and dull. If this is the start of the 2024s Love Sundays, it may not end well.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Whitney competes in the Red Pines golf tournament, but everyone can see she has lost a step since her mother, Coach Alice, died two years ago. Whitney's long-time caddy, Andrew, acts as her Interim Coach, but she hasn't officially hired him. Whitney loses the tournament but qualifies for the Eastern European Open next month. Andrew wants to return to Arizona immediately to practice, but Whitney says no. She must travel to Budapest to spend time with her father, Marton, on his birthday. Whitney's lack of focus frustrates Andrew, and he quits.<br/><br/>In Budapest, Whitney plays at Marton's golf resort with noise-cancelling headphones. She doesn't hear Daniel drive by in his golf cart. Daniel has been the course pro for a year. He gives Whitney a quick tip and drives away. Whitney meets with Marton and encourages him to get more involved with the golf course and his friends. He wants to sell it. Whitney respects Marton's decision but needs him to think it through. As she opens Marton's mind to healing, Whitney will learn new techniques with Daniel. But will it end when she discovers Daniel is working against her too?<br/><br/>This movie is slow unless you like golf, and the pivotal conflict spikes in the last 30 minutes of the film. The lead characters don't have a romantic spark until the end. It's great to see Whitney come into her confidence, but viewers never worry about the golf course sale or Whitney's relationship with Andrew. If you want something to watch without using your full attention, this is your film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
