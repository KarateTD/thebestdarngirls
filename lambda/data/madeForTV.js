    "review":"Lydia and her daughter, Elle, move across the country to start a new life. Elle's first day of school is Lydia's first day of work as vice principal. Lydia warns Elle that this school is a fresh start.<br/><br/>Lydia meets with the principal, Alice, to learn about the school. During their conversation, Alice reminds Lydia that she didn't receive Lydia's letter of recommendation. Lydia promises to send Alice a copy and gets to work finding the most popular kids in school. When she sees Kate's the frontrunner for homecoming queen, Lydia tells Elle to make Kate her best friend or worst enemy. Lydia would be happy and wealthy if she married her high school sweetheart. So Lydia tells Elle to forget her studies and focus on being homecoming queen by any means necessary. This mother-daughter duo will wreak havoc on the faculty and students.<br/><br/>O.M.G. is the only way to describe this movie. Lydia is delusional about the importance of a piece of plastic. No one deserves to have Lydia and Elle mess up their lives. And all for nothing. The plot pulls you in with hatred for Lydia and Elle and concern for everyone else. But it all falls flat in the end because you never know how or who solved the investigation. This film had a magnificent build-up to an incomplete conclusion.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gavin wakes his daughter, Elizabeth, and tells her to find a job. Elizabeth jumps on the computer and finds Stroller Mom's assistant posting. It's a workout group for new moms and allows them to bring their babies. Elizabeth sends the link to Gavin. He suffers from a heart attack after seeing a picture of the group's owner, Audrey. He explains that he lied to Elizabeth about how her mom died. Audrey killed Elizabeth's mom in a hit and run accident. Gavin begs Elizabeth to stay away from Audrey and goes into surgery. A few hours later, a doctor tells Elizabeth Gavin didn't make it. Elizabeth vows to ruin Audrey's life because Audrey took away both of her parents. Elizabeth changes her name to Brooklyn, applies for the job, and becomes an exemplary employee. Audrey doesn't take long introducing Brooklyn to her husband, Matt, their daughter, Zoe, and her best friend, Jane. One by one, they will all be gone.<br/><br/>This story centers around revenge and postpartum depression. Lifetimers, don't be surprised if you have little sympathy for Audrey in this film as Elizabeth, a.k.a Brooklyn, destroys Audrey's business, relationship, and friendship. You may even cheer for Elizabeth's wicked ways. Be warned: there is one scene that will make you cringe. The concept of the movie is strong, but it jumps to exposure too fast and with no explanation.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"What Happened to My Sister",
    "review":"Vanessa openly weeps as her daughter, Drea, unpacks boxes in her new dorm room. A year earlier, someone mugged and killed Drea's sister, Gabi.<br/><br/>Jess tells Drea they should check out some of the clubs advertising at the quad. Drea stops at the Delta Pi Zeta booth and talks to sorors Callie and Mindy. Drea admits Gabi was a Delta Pi girl, and Callie walks away. Mindy informs Drea that they would consider her a legacy, and it will give her a leg up to win a bid. Drea decides to go to the Delta Pi mixer with Jess. Mindy and Callie introduce Drea to their house mother, Rebecca.<br/><br/>After a few days, Drea wakes up with balloons and a card outside her door. The Deltas invited her to join, but not Jess. Rebecca gives each little sister a letter from the sorors stating why they got the invite. Drea's letter says that a mugger didn't kill Gabi, and Drea should trust no one. Drea will move into the sorority house to stay close to the culprit and investigate. She will risk everything to find out what happened to Gabi.<br/><br/>This movie provides a decent mystery for half of the film. The plot uses Lifetime clich√©s to steer you in the wrong direction. But they only dangle the carrot for the first hour. During the second hour, viewers will know who the killer is but not why. And it's touching to see Drea get guidance from Gabi to persevere.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Principal Whitlock pulls Annie and Coach Mitch into his office to discuss Annie's grades. Annie needs to maintain a 3.0 or better to keep her athletic scholarship for her private high school, Kingston. Sadly, Annie's history grade continues to plummet. Mr. Whitlock won't let Annie play lacrosse until her grades rise.<br/><br/>Delia calls Annie's name from across the parking lot and invites Annie to a party. Annie is dumbfounded because Delia is the most popular, rich girl in school. Annie gets home and studies but goes to the party with her best friend, Camille. Annie wants to get close to Delia and Regan because they got into ivy league schools. Regan tells Annie they got in by cheating. If Annie wants a good life like them, she should cheat too. Annie says no and walks away to the pool where Mitch is sitting. After an intense conversation, Annie kisses Mitch but doesn't see Delia taking a picture. Delia deletes the image because she considers Annie part of the inner circle. Hearing that, Annie decides to take Delia's help and cheat to raise her grade and cement her spot on the team.<br/><br/>Annie is a patsy with low-self esteem. To make matters worse, the girls cheat poorly. If you are going to cheat, at least be good at it. This movie is the standard Lifetime drama ending with a comical fight and one dead body. It's not the worst of Homecoming Week, but it won't be the best either.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Isabel works as the night security for a theater and has a daughter, Rosaline. Isabel drinks lots of energy shots and has scary visions of a man hurting her boss, Cameron. After a long patrol, a woman offers Isabel a coffee. She tells Isabel that she couldn't survive without coffee and welcomes Isabel to the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Isabel picks Rosaline up from school, and Rosaline's English teacher, Mr. Henry Cho, pulls Isabel aside. Someone caught Rosaline making out with Jonathan, the new boyfriend. Isabel explains Rosaline's behavior but doesn't excuse it. Isabel demands to meet Jonathan's mother. Jonathan walks Isabel over to his mother, and she is surprised to see it's the woman from across the street. Isabel remembers they never exchanged names. The woman is Megan.<br/><br/>Isabel hears a woman screaming during her next shift and looks up to see someone strangling Megan. Isabel calls the police immediately for help. The police walk up to Megan's apartment and knock on the door while Isabel stands off to the side. Megan answers with scratches on her neck. She explains that she was watching a horror movie with a high volume, and her scratches are from her cat. The detective questions Isabel and assumes her energy shots must have impaired her judgment. He tells her to stop drinking energy shots, relax, and get more rest. Isabel knows something isn't right. But is she willing to die to prove it?<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn to a predictable ending. It doesn't take much to see what is happening with Megan and her death. Also, Isabel doesn't play detective. Unfortunate incidences keep happening to her that give her clues. If you watch this movie, you can watch the first and last 30 minutes to understand the plot. The middle isn't necessary.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
