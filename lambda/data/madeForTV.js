    "mtitle": "A Husband to Die For: The Lisa Aguilar Story",
    "review": "Lisa sneaks to a private area with her husband, Darren, so they can have time alone while he's at work. Darren notices that Lisa is eating more than usual. Lisa informs him that she's 1 month pregnant with their first child. Several months later, Darren sees a beautiful co-worker, Michelle. While Lisa visits her parents, Darren and Michelle's torrid relationship gets physical.<br/><br/>Lisa and Darren learn that their doctor miscalculated the baby's due date. The baby is due in a few weeks. Darren lied to Michelle by saying he and Lisa are in divorce proceedings. And Lisa becomes more wary with each passing day. However, Lisa assumes it's the jitters of a first-time father.<br/><br/>Lisa returns home from grocery shopping and enters her apartment. A masked intruder attacks her and cuts her throat multiple times. She musters the strength to drag herself to the phone and dial 911. The doctor saves Lisa and her unborn son. She wakes with Darren by her side and Detective Goodwin outside her room.<br/><br/>Goodwin questions Lisa about her attacker, her marriage, and her actions on the day of the attack. A few moments later, Lisa hears Darren screaming, and Goodwin escorts him away in handcuffs. The police arrested Darren for Lisa's attempted murder. But she refused to believe the love of her life would harm her. Lisa demands justice for Darren, but is she willing to die for it?<br/><br/>Lifetimers, please give Lisa some grace during this film. Remember, this is the early 90s. So, words like gaslighting, red flags, and narcissist aren't common phrases pushed by a social media algorithm. The writers give viewers a glimpse at the main characters' backgrounds. Darren's parents expect nothing less than greatness and impose their will and dreams on him. Lisa's family is accommodating and understanding. The attack is brutal and could be a trigger for some viewers. However, this level of violence is necessary to understand the hell Lisa and her unborn child survived. This film proves that you may never know the person you lie next to.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Sadie has no choice but to move in with Grant and Evelyn. Sadie believes she is doing the best for her family. Unfortunately, she has entered a house of horrors.

    "mtitle": "Sugar Mama",
    "review": "Tech Investor Veronica is a guest lecturer at a college campus. During her presentation, student Mike enters late. Afterward, Mike approaches Veronica with an apology. She walks towards the parking lot and sees an older woman with two younger men. The woman is a sugar mama and uses an app to find her sugar babies. She shows Veronica the app, and Veronica asks her assistant, Andrew, to research it for her company. Veronica scrolls through the profiles and finds Mike. She requests a meeting.<br/><br/>Mike relaxes at home when his sugar mama, Beverly, knocks on the door. She's ending their arrangement early because he couldn't commit more time to her. Mike's girlfriend, Gia, slowly enters the room. They still need $8,000 to pay their tuition. He will work harder to find a replacement for Beverly. Mike opens the app and sees that Veronica selected him. He assures Gia that this will secure their future and accepts the request.<br/><br/>Mike and Veronica meet at dinner. She will pay him if he attends meetings, luncheons, galas, and other functions. She wants him to do research on the sugar baby app and introduce his app to investors. He will work for $10,000 a month for the next three months. They agree to the arrangement. Mike runs and tells Gia that he found a solution to their money woes. He has no idea that he is in danger. Veronica is an unhinged woman with a horrific plan for Mike and everyone in his orbit.<br/><br/>Nothing can prepare you for this film. There aren't enough words to describe Veronica's unsettling behavior. The writers did a stupendous job ensuring that everyone looks suspicious. However, Veronica's intentions are ghastly and 100% unpredictable, but the breadcrumbs are there for viewers to follow. It's been a while since Lifetime had a story this captivating without it being a 'true crime.' This Tubi masterpiece on Lifetime will make the audience beg for a part 2 and therapy.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Groomsmen First Look",
    "review": "Doctor Pete fusses with his bow tie while reviewing his patient's status on the phone. He hangs up, turns, and bumps into Doctor Chelsea, dropping their identical phones. He picks them up and double-checks that he returned hers. Chelsea breathes a sigh of relief because she is the maid of honor, and the phone has her speech on it. She confesses her fear of public speaking, and Pete tells her to imagine everyone in their pajamas. She fixes his bow tie as he explains that the bride's brother, Danny, is his best friend. They leave for the reception, and Pete sits with Jackson. He watches Chelsea slip into the main table. She stands to speak, and her phone dies. She quietly panics and looks toward Pete. He mouths 'pajamas,' and it calms her.<br/><br/>Danny and Jackson notice that Pete is missing. They realized he snuck away to spend time with Chelsea. While eating pretzels, Chelsea reveals that she is in town for the wedding. She works in a European clinic and will leave in the morning. Pete's sad by her admission, and updates his friends. They remind him that long-distance relationships are possible.<br/><br/>Pete runs to Chelsea's hotel in the morning, but the concierge points to Chelsea, getting in the cab. He sprints down the street screaming Chelsea's name. Then, Chelsea steps beside Danny and Jackson and asks why Pete is yelling and running away. Panting, Pete returns to the hotel and asks Chelsea for a long-distance romance. Chelsea admits that this type of relationship is new for her, but she's willing to give it a chance. This leap of faith will lead to a tree beating, crazy parents, and a fashion show. But will it end in heartbreak?<br/><br/>Hallmark has another franchise smash hit in its lineup. This first film of a three-part series is funny, romantic, and heartwarming. Yes, the script focuses on Chelsea and Pete's romance. However, it shines a light on the friendship between the three men. This movie is interesting because it's told through the narration of a runaway bride, hiding in a bar. This first installment is a spectacular way to hook the fans and make them yearn for more. If you are a fan of the Three Wise Men Series, then buckle up for another Hallmark classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Girl Who Vanished",
    "review": "Kate catches her daughter, Lily, sneaking into the house after spending the evening with Dean. Kate grounds Lily, and Lily is angry. She believes Kate is taking out her fears on her. Ten years ago, someone abducted Kate's other daughter, Emily. The police never found the young girl.<br/><br/>After school, Kate informs Lily that it's her father's weekend. And she told Matt about the punishment and warned him to stick to it. When the phone rings, Kate leaves to answer it, and Lily hears the sound of glass shattering. The police found Emily alive. Officer Bowen offers to give a DNA test, but Kate wants to wait until they get her home.<br/><br/>Emily settles into her home and delights that things look the same, except for Lily's room. As everyone rejoices about Emily's return, Lily sees the kinks in her armor. She gets details about the abduction wrong, develops new allergies, and becomes agitated when people ask probing questions. Lily starts to wonder if Emily is her sister. She warns Kate, but Kate tells Lily to let it go. However, Lily won't allow anyone to stop her from learning the truth, not even a killer.<br/><br/>This film has a classic Lifetime setup. A kidnapped victim returns home, and the elated family refuses a DNA test. So fans know this 'survivor' is hiding something sinister. In Lifetime fashion, the secondary characters drop like flies. The writers pulled you into the story by making everyone act strangely, and the backing track amps up these feelings with mysterious and cryptic music. The twist and several hits to the face are compelling. While the build is standard, the twist is unsurprisingly fun. If fans can get past adults playing teens, you will enjoy this 2-hour reality break.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
