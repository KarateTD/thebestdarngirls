    "review": "Emily and Tom return home after dropping off their daughter, Sophia, at college. Emily desires to reconnect, but Tom redirects his efforts to his book. Emily goes to work and sees the tension on her co-worker's face. Their artist pulled out of the gallery showing. However, her boss, Margo, has a solution. She found a new artist, Carlo, but he is tough to nail down. She tasks Emily with going to his studio to iron out the details.<br/><br/>Emily arrives at Carlo's home, and he's working. She stops taking pictures of the model to admire Emily's beauty. Carlo promises to have 20 pieces for the showing and begs Emily to stay. She makes a hasty exit. Days later, Emily returns to Carlo's apartment to discuss their marketing strategy. But he wants to discuss her. Carlo kisses her but gives her the option to pull away. Emily ends up in his bed. Shamefully, she leaves Carlo's home and runs to her place.<br/><br/>Emily sleeps with Carlo several times, but excuses her infidelity because Tom is ignoring her. The day of the showing, Emily shows her family Carlo's artwork. Margo calls the room's attention to Carlo's pièce de résistance. They unveil a large portrait of Emily undressed in Carlo's bed. Tom and Sophia leave as Margo fires Emily. Emily sprints home and lies to Tom. Carlo calls Emily and begs her to leave her husband because she's unhappy. Emily screams at him that their affair is over. She thinks it's the end, but Carlo won't let the love of his life go that easily.<br/><br/>Emily is dead wrong for this. There is zero excuse for cheating. So the audience won't have any sympathy for her plight. Viewers will think Sophia is the only victim in this story. While the plot is exciting, it's not new. It's a Tyler Perry movie on Lifetime. Remember Temptation or Mea Culpa. A vital twist is missing from this film to separate it from others in the genre. The acting saves the script. This picture is a decent ride to a predictable end with an eye-rolling, best-case-scenario conclusion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Therapist Sophia spends quality time with her husband, Attorney Will. She is elated until Melissa enters her office. Melissa exposes Will's affair during their engagement. Sophia confronts Will with the allegations, and he confesses that it's true. He begs Sophia to forget his past indiscretions, but she throws him out of the house.<br/><br/>Sophia attends yoga with her best friend, Hailey. Handsome Jonathan approaches Sophia. They laugh, share, and connect. Sophia adjusts to life as a single woman, but a burglar derails her sanctity. First, Sophia calls Jonathan, but he doesn't answer the phone. Then, she phones Will. Will rushes over to comfort her. Then, Jonathan arrives, and the two men size each other up. Sophia pushes them out of her home.<br/><br/>Sophia and Hailey enjoy class again when Jonathan brainstorms an outing. They should attend a yoga retreat at Big Sur. Hailey and Sophia agree. They think it will be their Eat, Pray, Love moment. However, someone will die. Will Sophia survive the trip?<br/><br/>This film is unintentionally funny. Sophia is a therapist who refuses to process her feelings. The writers created Jonathan to be an entitled jerk. Now, Sophia's yoga mate, Jordyn, brings the tea. She is a flirt with the information for everyone. Her character is a standout and a joy to watch. The plot, reveal, and deaths are stereotypical for this network. At least Jordyn survives. Watch this film if you need to kill 2 hours with minimal attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Donna wakes in a hospital bed with a tube down her throat. The nurse informs Donna that she was in a car accident. She has been in a coma for 7 days. Donna grabs her stomach and asks if she's given birth in that week. Confused, the nurse tells Donna that her 3-month-old baby was in the car, but didn't have injuries. Donna suffers from retrograde amnesia. One thing Donna remembers is losing her husband, Scott, in an auto accident.<br/><br/>Donna's brother, Mason, comes to the room with the baby as the nurse leaves. She asks Mason for the baby's name, but he doesn't know it either. Mason watched a news report earlier with a couple, Amira and Leon, pleading for a kidnapper to return their daughter, Cleo. Mason can't get over how much Donna's baby looks like Cleo.<br/><br/>Donna and Mason take the baby to Donna's home without alerting the hospital staff. Donna gives her a DNA test. The baby is a match. However, Mason reads that it's a 23% match. He admits that the baby is Cleo, but he is the father. He and Amira were having an affair. She was on the verge of leaving her abusive husband. Donna and Mason must uncover a horrible truth about Scott's death, Amira's secrets, and Leon's depravity. The truth won't be an easy pill to swallow.<br/><br/>This film starts with a flashback to Scott's accident from Donna's hospital bed. You see the happy couple expecting a baby while working their moving business. Then, the script thrusts you into the present, and you have as much knowledge as Donna. As the drama unfolds, the story follows. You learn about Amira and Leon's marriage, Amira's ties to Scott, and Amira's connection to Donna. And if that's not wild enough, Leon is on a rampage. The drama is far-fetched, but the storytelling is superb. This Tubi original found a perfect home with Lifetime.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Providence Falls: An Impossible Promise",
    "review": "Cora and Liam work together after Liam rejected her. They acknowledge it's awkward but put the past behind them. They must find John's killer and locate John's missing wife, Merideth. Also, Liam must make Cora fall in love with Finn while his feelings for her intensify.<br/><br/>Liam's case worker, Salaem, and handler, Agon, sift through Cora's memories. Everything happening now mirrors what happened in 1884. If history repeats itself, Cora's life will end. Agon wishes Liam and Cora could be together, but he has to focus on the bigger picture.<br/><br/>Suzette and Cora hang out at a pub with Liam, who invited Finn. Liam persuades Cora to speak to Finn, but an old friend, Magnus, interferes and introduces himself. Liam sees Agon at a table and pulls him outside. He updates Agon about Cora's feelings, Finn's progress, and Magnus. Suzette quietly enters the back alley and eavesdrops on their conversation. Then she sees Agon disappear. She gasps, and Liam hears her. He explains that Agon is an angel, and Suzette surprisingly believes him. She agrees to help Liam secretly bring Finn and Cora together.<br/><br/>Agon returns and reports to Salaem. The name Magnus worries her. She filters through her files and pulls up a dossier on Bael. Agon remembers seeing him. Salaem tenses because Bael works for the other side. She summarizes that Magnus might be working for Bael, and Bael has implanted Cora with false memories to make her believe she was friends with him. Now, Liam and Cora must put their feelings aside to find John's killer and Meredith's location, while Bael and Agon work for their side. Who will win?<br/><br/>Based on An Impossible Promise by Jude Deveraux and Tara Sheets, the second installment is more nerve-racking, funnier, and more surprising than the first. The script amplifies the drama of the case and the romance. As Cora and Liam work on the case, Liam and Agon uncover Magnus's motive. This installment will leave your jaw on the floor with one sentence. You have no idea where this plot is going, and it will leave you yearning for the next.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Finding Faith",
    "review": "Jaylen and Faith host a barbecue with his family and his youth basketball team. Jaylen updates his father, Henry, on his job search. He has been looking for work for a year, but hasn't found anything yet. Jaylen's mother, Helen, nitpicks at everything Faith does until the Pastor approaches the back patio. Pastor Louis greets the women and settles in for a meal. Helen continues to berate Faith when Louis walks away.<br/><br/>Jaylen takes Faith out for dinner to celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary. He surprises her by having the singer, Maria, congratulate them. They have a lovely night, and Jaylen makes breakfast for Faith in the morning. She sees an envelope under the Lazy Susan and pulls out a stack of past-due bills. She's astonished because she thought Jaylen had everything under control. He believes they would do better if she attended church more and worked less. She takes a deep breath and prepares to argue, but their son, Bryson, enters the kitchen.<br/><br/>During church, Faith gets a call from her boss, Cedric. Jaylen's upset that Faith took the call but understands they need the money. She promises to make it in time to drive to the basketball team's game. However, Cedric changes his mind about giving Faith the weekend off. Jaylen is upset that he had to drive 6 hours without help.<br/><br/>Jaylen drives as the team, including Bryson, laughs in the back. Jaylen sees a text from Faith and reads it. He takes his eyes off the road. He dodges a vehicle and flips the van several times. He runs inside and pulls everyone out. But he passes out inside the automobile, and it explodes. Jaylen dies. Faith goes into a downward spiral of addiction, custody battles, and foreclosure. She gives up on God, but he's not through with her yet.<br/><br/>This film is a welcome change from the Lifetime format. The first act will break your heart and make you beg for a commercial break. Thankfully, it comes in time. The director made spectacular choices in capturing Faith's despair. When she has to choose between work and the church, Cedric's lighting darkens behind her. He is the devil in her ear. While these elements enthrall you, it's the script that keeps you coming. The conclusion will keep you watching until the last second as Faith packs her bags for a new start. Realistic hardships, complex family dynamics, and belief fill this movie to the brim. It's a beautiful film that can fit on any platform.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
