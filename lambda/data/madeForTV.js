    "review":"Val kisses her husband, Mark, and reminds him about date night. Val sees him off and helps their sons, Spencer and Parker, through the winter break. She goes outside to ask her neighbor, Bob, to stop sawing wood but offers to make him lemonade instead. Val hears banging at the door while making lemonade. She assumes Bob wants his lemonade now and opens it with a calming breath. Instead, Val sees a stranger, Denny, with a double-barrel shotgun, dripping in sweat and mumbling. When Denny points his gun at Spencer, Val runs between them and vows to keep Spencer out of Denny's way. He wants to leave but worries the police will spot him. So Val offers to drive the car if Denny doesn't hurt her sons. Val gets in the car and follows Denny's demands while praying to live through the ordeal. She has no idea what terror the next 12 desperate hours will bring.<br/><br/>Adapted from Last Dance, Last Chance by Ann Rule, the writer loosely based this on the story of Patricia Jean Jaque. It doesn't take long for the plot to bring the viewers into a panic. The storyline paints Denny as an unhinged man looking for his ex-girlfriend, Cherie. She keeps him calm and passes information to bystanders to keep them safe. While the story focuses on the kidnapping, it's about two love stories. The first is a developed marriage that needs some nurturing, but the other relationship is toxic and codependent. The conclusion is like those two relationships because it's loving and sad. So, be prepared to cheer and feel defeated.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"David and Lauren travel to Atlanta for their honeymoon because David has some loose ends to tie up since his father died. Lauren notices a change in David's demeanor when Lauren kisses him. She wants to know more about what's bothering David, but he doesn't desire to discuss it.<br/><br/>David and Lauren get food, and a woman, Gina, pays for their meal. Gina walks to their table and introduces herself. After Gina leaves, they go running in the woods, and a man starts chasing Lauren, causing her to have an asthma attack. The man runs away when he sees David, and they call the police.<br/><br/>David and Lauren go to a farmer's market, but David sees a woman from his past. She looks like his ex-wife, Sadie, and he walks over for a better look. The woman isn't Sadie, but Lauren demands to know what's on David's mind. David assures Lauren he is fine and offers to get them some water. David returns and can't find Lauren. He calls the police, but they snidely ignore his claims. They assume Lauren left him. So they refuse to file a missing persons report. David doesn't think Lauren would dump him on their honeymoon and needs to find her before she dies.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of doing too much. It covers an abusive marriage, a stalking ex-spouse, an evil stepmother, a secretive husband, a kidnapping, and a drug ring in two hours. With so many storylines, the plot still has loose ends and leaves possibilities for a part 2. And the final recap is just as confusing as the rest of the story. It has a lot of moving parts with zero direction.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Law student Christina updates her parents, Noah and Liz, on her roommate search. Before Christina leaves for class, she hears her parents arguing over her birthday party. Liz worries that Noah won't make it to Christina's party because he is doing everything to become a partner at his law firm. Liz runs a catering business at home and explains that she needs extra hands to help with orders. Noah says he doesn't understand how Liz's hobby got so big, and Liz is furious at his dismissive comments.<br/><br/>Christina interviews several potential roommates, but only one stands out: Alyssa. Christina takes Alyssa to the apartment and offers Alyssa the room for rent. As they iron out the details, Christina gets a text message from Noah. She grabbed Noah's folder by accident, and Noah needs it now to get a leg up with his boss, Andrew. Christina doesn't have enough time to drop off the folder and go to class, so Alyssa offers to take the folder to Noah. Alyssa arrives at Noah's office but refuses to give the folder to Noah's assistant, Patricia. Patricia rolls her eyes and walks Alyssa to Noah's office. Alyssa introduces herself as Christina's new roommate, and Noah makes pleasantries. Alyssa leaves Noah's office with a plan to make Noah fall in love with her and leave Liz. And she won't let anyone stop her.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the dumbest men in LMN history. Noah, Craig, and Peter fall for the oldest tricks in the book and become Alyssa's willing prey. Viewers won't see them as victims, just pathetic fools. The script paints Liz as a nag and Noah as a jerk. Christina is the only innocent party who calls out everyone's actions. If you want a scandalous movie with only one likable character, this film is for you. Otherwise, be prepared to yell at the screen while rooting for Alyssa.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Chrissy passes notes to Ryan during the debate competition because she has glossophobia. However, Ryan can't read her notecards and loses the match. Chrissy runs into Dean Martel outside, and he warns Chrissy that she could forfeit her scholarship if she continues to lose. She promises to do better and focuses on the next competition.<br/><br/>Chrissy unwinds at a party with her friend, Sarah, and plays beer pong against Nathan. Nathan is the Dean's son but doesn't like to advertise it. Nathan challenges Chrissy to another round of beer pong but doesn't see someone spike her drink. Sarah sees that Chrissy is unsteady, but Chrissy assures Sarah she can make it to the dorm alone. A man in a bird mask attacks Chrissy, draws a symbol on the back of her neck, and takes a photo of her on the ground with her skirt up. Chrissy runs away but passes out on the grass.<br/><br/>Chrissy wakes up in a hospital room with Sarah and Nathan at her bedside. Chrissy and Nora want to report the attack to the cops, but Nathan convinces Chrissy not to because the Dean could expel her for underage drinking on campus. Instead, Chrissy wants to meet with the Dean to report the incident. Chrissy wants the school to investigate and warn other students. However, Dean says it's a case of he said she said and refuses. But Chrissy won't give up and asks Sarah to cover her story in the university newspaper. Sarah's report emboldens past victims and enrages a secret society of abusers dating back decades. They won't let Chrissy ruin their way of life and plan to destroy her to maintain it.<br/><br/>This movie is reminiscent of Black Christmas minus the holiday. Chrissy and Nora took too long to see the signs of the society and the traitor in their midst. This secret society is a women-bashing group that wants to strengthen the patriarchy. However, Chrissy's blatant mistakes and head-over-heels mentality will irritate viewers and make you lose interest in her safety and well-being.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jake packs his carry-on with Ray's engagement ring inside. For six years, Ray dated Olivia. And now, Ray wants to propose with the perfect ring. Jake will bring the ring on his flight back to L.A.. Jake, Olivia, and Ray are opening J.O.R. Workshop in L.A. in a few days, but Ray wants to propose before the store's grand opening.<br/><br/>Evie, short for Everett, will travel to Vancouver with a connecting flight to L.A.. She is an associate producer with her friend Barbara on a movie set. They are remaking Cyrano de Bergerac, and Evie has the custom prosthetic nose for the lead actor. She puts the nose in her carry-on and boards the flight. The woman next to Jake worries that people's luggage crowds her bag in the overhead storage bins. So the flight attendant re-arranges the bags and puts Jake and Evie's carry-ons next to each other, not realizing they are identical.<br/><br/>Evie can see that Jake is nervous during the flight because he folds napkins into shapes and flinches during turbulence. She preoccupies him during the flight with conversations about the past. Jake writes his number on a napkin, folds it into a rose, and gives it to Evie. Evie thanks him and gathers her things. Evie leaves the plane for her connection, and Jake goes to J.O.R. Workshop.<br/><br/>Jake tells his friends about the cute girl on the plane but doesn't think he will see her again. Then, he opens his bag to give Ryan Olivia's engagement ring but finds a big nose. Evie tells her friend, Barbara, about the paper-rose man and swoons. Then, Evie opens her bag to give the nose to her producer, Michael, but finds men's clothes. Jake and Evie need to get their bags from the other. It could ruin Ryan's relationship and Michael's movie. However, finding each other will only be half the battle. The other fight is reclaiming their spark from the plane.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a split screen of the luggage and the significant, time-sensitive item Jake and Eve carry. At first, you believe this movie will be about them finding each other physically, but it's not. They get to know each other through their friends but constantly jump to conclusions about the other. Not only do viewers get a unique storyline, but they also get three love stories in one film. This film hooks you with wit, a complex plot, and honest tales of love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
