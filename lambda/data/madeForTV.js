    "review":"Lindsey's dad, Jim, goes over the menu for her and Gavin's wedding reception, but she reminds him to focus on other things.  As they laugh about the future, Lindsey's mom, Annie, goes on a run.  Then Jim gets a call from the police.  Annie was a victim of a hit and run and didn't survive.  At the funeral, Lindsey sees a woman in the distance but ignores her.  Later, the same woman shows up at Annie's wake.  Jim tells Lindsey the woman is Sarah, her half-sister.  Before Jim met Annie, he met Sarah's mom, Franny, and got her pregnant.  Franny kept Jim a secret until she died.  Now, Jim and Sarah want to reconnect.  Lindsey feels confused, betrayed, and suspicious.  And she has every right to be.  Sarah wants Lindsey's fiancé, business, and dad.  Can Lindsey convince her family of Sarah's ill intentions?<br/><br/>'Only on Lifetime' is a sentiment you will repeat while watching this movie.  Sarah has the family wrapped around her finger with an allergy, two hit-and-runs, and a family business to manipulate.  You don't watch this to figure out who.  Instead, you want to know how Sarah did it and when Lindsey will uncover it.  Both questions will have an answer.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Hot Chocolate Holiday",
    "review":"Colette tolls night and day to recreate her grandmother's hot chocolate recipe into a powder mix.  Colette needs to get the recipe right and read the contract so grocery chains can sell her mix.  At the Christmas Kick-off, Colette meets Marcus.  He's renting the store next to hers and opening a bakery.<br/><br/>Colette orders a brownie with hot chocolate from Marcus's shop the next day.  She takes one sip and recognizes it as her recipe.  Colette thinks he stole it and wants to gather proof.  When her investigation doesn't get results, she tells him to stop selling it.  But he won't because it's his recipe.  Working on her grocery store deal, Frank heard about her competitor.  He gives her a warning.  If Marcus claims it's his recipe, it can kill her contract.  As she devises a plan, a fire destroys everything but the truth, the past, and their love.<br/><br/>While the plot follows the T.V. romance format, it solves the mystery of the recipe sooner than you would expect.  Instead of dragging it on for two hours, viewers learn the truth in the first hour.  Rebuilding their connection is the focus of the second half.  It gives the main characters more time to connect and heal.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
