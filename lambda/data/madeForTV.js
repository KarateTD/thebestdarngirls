    "mtitle":"The Neighbor in the Window",
    "review":"Karen and Scott tour a home and find gorgeous windows covered up by blackout curtains. When she moves in, she takes them down first.  After they get settled, several neighbors introduce themselves.  One of the neighbors is the married mother of 2, Lisa.  The two women bond over losing a child to SIDS. The women go out shopping and Karen finds a killer red dress.  Lisa tells her to buy it.  The next day Karen drops her son off for the first day of school wearing the red dress.  She turns around to see Lisa wearing the same thing.  She can't believe Lisa bought her dress but brushes it off as a coincidence. Karen sees Lisa's husband Dan and talks about losing their baby.  Dan is confused.  He and Lisa never lost a child, his sister-in-law did.  Karen can't believe Lisa lied about losing a baby.  When Karen confronts her about it, Lisa says she has Parkinson's Disease.  It's not long before Karen learns that's a lie too.  Karen tries to ignore it until Lisa asks Karen to borrow $5,000.  Karen's refusal brings on a call to the police, a call to a lawyer, and a restraining order.<br/><br/>Based on true events that inspired the novel False Victim by Kathie Truitt, Lisa is suffering from False Victimation Syndrome stemming from her Borderline Personality Disorder.  This mental illness manifested itself into a unique form of Acquaintance Stalking.  It's shuddersome how easily Lisa can manipulate the people around her by staying one step ahead. While the ending is tormenting but it's honest.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"InstaPsycho",
    "review":"Maddie and Ava have welcomed the new girl, Kelly into their circle.  Kelly is a foster kid who feels out of step due to little financial support.    After class, Sasha finds Kelly and asks if she came from the family that got a roof from a charity.  Kelly says yes.  Sasha takes out her camera and starts recording an Instagram video that praises herself and embarrasses Kelly. Kelly decides to knock Sasha off her pedestal. She steals an expensive bra and makes a seductive post while hashtagging it 'suck it, Sasha'. She wants to beat Sasha on social media by any means necessary. Ava and Maddie cheer her on and join the fun.  When the social media competition turns deadly, who will survive?<br/><br/>This movie takes cyberbullying and social narcissism to an extreme.  Kelly is only concerned with clicks and likes.  She will use sex, death, and tears to be number one in school. The message is geared towards teenagers, however, several adults could learn from this movie too. On the other hand, the movie doesn't demonize technology.  It uses technology to set the record straight.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Mr. Write",
    "review":"After hearing her boss is going to give Michael the pink slip, Dori sticks her neck out for him.  Dori is a low-level editor for a publishing company and Michael was one of their best selling authors.  He hasn't written anything in a year. She has 30 days to get Michael to deliver a book.  If not, he will be fired and she will never be promoted. She is dumbfounded when she meets Michael.  He is a slob, rude, a party boy, and lost his love for writing.  To add-on the pressure, Dori is engaged to Philip, the perfect boyfriend.  He offers to handle all the arrangements for her.  He even hired a wedding planner.  When feelings go awry, what couple will make it to the altar?<br/><br/>This movie grabs your attention because it talks about literary romance being fake while presenting the viewer with a literary romance subplot.  This movie differs from Hallmark because there is a real scandal, lies, and heartbreak. This movie is a fun watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Natalie is down because she was fired from her TV show.  The ratings fell and fans thought she lost her authenticity over the years.  Her mother suggests she face the past to get her authenticity back. She is sure she will run into her ex-boyfriend Zack. After a little more nudging, Natalie says goodbye to her boyfriend Brook and heads back to her hometown.  Natalie doesn't know her mom and Zack's mom have devised a plan. Their plan involves an auction, hardware store meet-up, and a kissing booth.<br/><br/>This is a classic Hallmark plot, with funny, nosy moms will tickle your funny bone.  It doesn't take long for viewers to see that Brook is a non-factor in the story.  He is just a prop for Natalie to see what she wants in life. It's the moms that make this movie entertaining to watch.  Seeing their sneaky, persuasive, and nagging ways to get their kids together is the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
