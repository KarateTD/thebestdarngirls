    "mtitle":"A Christmas Exchange",
    "review":"After 20 years of falling in love with the posh British gentlemen in books and film, Molly hasn't found the handsome prince to profess his love for her.  She goes to work, and her boss gives her dreadful news, he is shutting down the newspaper, and she is out of work.  Molly has no idea what to do next until her dog finds her life roadmap that Molly wrote as a child.  In the roadmap, Molly stated that she wanted to go to London, see where her parents fell in love, and meet a British gentleman.  She throws caution to the wind and puts her home on a home exchange site.  Across the pond, Patrick is in finance and decided it's not the life for him. Patrick has always wanted to go to someplace remote and work on his novel.  He puts his home on the exchange website and spins a globe that lands on Connecticut.  Within minutes, Molly and Patrick are swapping houses for several months. However, all paths lead into each other's arms.  But only if Molly can get over Patrick's lie.<br/><br/>With similarities, it's easy to see how The Holiday inspired this movie.  During Molly's tenure in London, she meets an author who believes technology ruins relationships.  Molly is a living example that the author's statement isn't true. They communicate with each other about families, dogs, and books all through technology.  This film is an intelligent movie that could work for any season.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lisa and all the other passengers disembark the bus.  The bus driver tells the passengers that they will have to return to Las Vegas because the snow is falling too hard in the nearby areas.  Lisa hears Brad, a snowboarder, arguing over the phone with his girlfriend. Lisa runs outside and asks Brad for a ride for $180, which is all the money she has.  He makes a better deal.  He will give her a ride, but she has to split the gas with him.  They drive through the night but crash the car. They walk to the Rosemont, and Josie and Abe meet them with guns, along with demands to leave.  Lisa puts her hands in the air and screams that she is pregnant.  Josie still doesn't want them to stay, but her assistant, Abe, won't do any such thing.  He lets them inside, and Lisa and Brad take off their hats.  Josie sees Lisa and becomes light-headed.  She offers the young pair a set of clothes, shelter, and food.  No one has any idea that someone is looking for Lisa and her baby.  And with $75,000 on the line, they will do anything to anyone to get Lisa and the baby back.<br/><br/>Josie may be stubborn, but she is everything to this movie.  She demands respect, gives wisdom, and triumphs over most adversity in her life.  However, it's losing her family that forced her to close the doors of the famed Rosemont, and it's the reason she can't bear to look at Lisa. This masterpiece of emotion could air at any time of the year and make you drop everything to watch.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Nina drops some shocking news to Josie, as she finishes her red velvet cheesecake pie, that Tanner made a reservation at the restaurant.  Tanner is a harsh food critic that gave Josie's former bakery a lukewarm review. At the end of the meal, Nina brings Pepper and Tanner a slice of Josie's cheesecake, and they love it.  Josie tells them it won't be on Nina's menu because it's a trial pie for Josie's mom's, Pamela's, Bed and Breakfast. Later, Tanner looks up the Bed and Breakfast and makes a reservation. Pamela lets Josie know about their other unexpected guest, Tanner.  The moment he steps on the property, Josie confronts him about his reason for being there.  Tanner apologizes for the article about her bakery.  He says he gave it an honest review, but Pepper spiced it up to gain more readers.  Josie accepts his apology.  However, he can only write a review if he likes the B and B..  But if Tanner doesn't, Tanner can only tell her.  He makes the deal: however, the food won't be the only thing Tanner loves.  This budding romance may not start after Josie's homemade whip cream with strawberries go missing.<br/><br/>This movie is a Hallmark plot on Lifetime.  It's over the top characters, with obvious plot points and non-threatening romantic rivals, make the outcome all too predictable. It can be entertaining at the right moments.  Save this movie for a snowy day or a dessert movie.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Holiday Heartbreak",
    "review":"Almost 30 years ago, Mike 'Mack' McCoy toyed with another woman's heart, but she refuses to let him walk away without any responsibility.  Summer tells him that on his daughter's 30th birthday, she will fall in love with a man who will treat her as badly as he treats women.  Mike laughs off Summer's threat and goes home to his wife.  Today, Mike is a successful architect.  After his wife passed away, Mike married Joyce, and she became a step-mother to his daughter, Monica.  The night before her 30th birthday, Monica goes out with her friends to a comedy club.  The featured comedian, Wild Bill, approaches them.  As Monica's friends blow him off, the clock strikes midnight, and she starts kissing him.  Later, Monica introduces Wild Bill to her father, Mike, and Mike can't believe it. Then Monica tells Mike she is quitting her job, getting married on Christmas Eve, and she's going on tour with Wild Bill after the wedding. Disgusted with her dad's behavior, Monica leaves with Wild Bill.  After they leave, Joyce tries to calm Mike down, and there's a knock at the door.  It's Eric. Earlier that week, Eric and Monica met each other, and he thought they hit it off, but now Wild Bill has all of her attention.  Then, Mike's memory triggers back to his last night with Summer, and he realizes her curse was real.  Mike and Eric run to Summer's home for answers.  She tells the men that Mike has to apologize to all the women he hurt for the curse to lift, but if she marries Wild Bill, the curse will last forever. Can he save Monica in time?<br/><br/>This movie has a decent beginning and a semi-entertaining middle, but it falls apart at the end.  The storyline falls off the rails with a poorly choreographed and shot fight scene. It will quickly feel like a waste of time for you and the actors' talent.  You can skip this movie on your holiday binge.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
