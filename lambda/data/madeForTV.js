    "review":"After bonding over becoming first-time dads, Glen sees Harry in the hospital hall with tears in his eyes.  Harry and Olivia's baby girl died a few hours after being born.  ix months later, Harry is working for Glen at an accounting firm.  Glen and Brooke invite their friends and family to meet their new baby girl, Sienna.  At the party, Olivia sees her birthing nurse, Nancy, leaving.  Nancy thought she was invited but was asked to leave.  Nancy tells Olivia if she ever needs to talk about losing her baby, Nancy will be there for her.  When Olivia sees baby Sienna, something washes over her and she tells Harry she wants to leave now.  Olivia has made it her mission to be near Sienna.  Nannies, restraining orders, embezzlement, and sexual harassment claims won't stop her.<br/><br/>This movie is like 5 Lifetime movies wrapped into one.  It will keep you guessing with secret text messages, missing money, and one baby in the balance.  Just when you believe you have it all figured out, another curveball is thrown at you.  And you have to stay until the end for a recap of all the clues you missed from the beginning.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Josh and Jules are home flippers with lots of success.  Jules has her eye on a sprawling property with an elevator, large gate, and garden.  Josh believes it's out of their price range, she convinces him to take a look at the property because its the dream home she always drew. They are stunned to hear they got the house.  They decide to move in for a few days to make some changes and updates to the home.  They have Edgar to help with gardening and other handyman duties around the home.  Josh is a licensed contractor with a company.  Bliss, Josh's friend, is moving in to help, too.  As they walk into the house, they find a flyer for an interior decorator named Morgan in the mailbox.  Jules loves Morgan's work and Josh trusts Jules's taste.  Things are working great but they don't know the evil lurking under the surface.   Morgan only wants the house.  She will lie, steal, bribe, and kill go get it.  Her plan goes into full action when Jules and Josh decide to keep the home for themselves instead of flipping it.<br/><br/>If something seems too good to be true then it probably is.  Morgan's portfolio is phenomenal until you learn its all lies.  She seems great on the surface, but she will blackmail anyone to get what she wants.  She will even use sexual harassment, domestic violence, and workman's compensation to get her way.  Nothing is too far or too dirty for her. This movie does follow the normal Lifetime tropes but the characters are getting smarter faster with each movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Nina, a cardiologist, cares deeply about her patients.  She plans to do more at the hospital if she is promoted to Chief Resident. With the vote being split, Ed tells Nina she needs to shmooze Beverly for the job.  Beverly will be the deciding vote on the board.  The best way to get in Beverly's good graces is to back her plan for a healthy eating seminar in the hospital.  Beverly invited her favorite chef Dave to cook.  While she wants Dave to teach the seminar, he doesn't want to do it.  As she and her friend Olivia - the neurosurgeon - put on their aprons, Nina tries to talk to Dave.  He abruptly cuts her off.  He will only talk after class is over.  After class, it's clear to Dave that Olivia did all the work.  Dave doesn't want to hear Nina's proposal because she doesn't respect the process.  Self-assured, Nina bets she can cook anything.  If she can, he will teach the seminar.  Confident, Dave takes the bet.  While they cook, Nina will learn that cooking is not only good for the body but good for the soul.<br/><br/>Based on a strong premise, this movie could have been an enjoyable TV series.  This movie sets itself apart because you get pulled into the lives of Nina's patients.  The pull is so strong, you will need tissues.  With so much going on in one movie, the love story between Nina and Dave take a back seat allowing it to evolve naturally for viewers.  This is one to keep on the DVR.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie is a wedding photographer.  As the boat docks at Piedmont Island, Maggie recognizes the surname of the wedding party.  She is shocked to see her ex-boyfriend Jake disembark the boat.  She congratulates him and asks about his bride.  Jake laughs and tells Maggie he is not get getting married, his sister, Jennifer, is and he will be walking her down the aisle.  For a brief moment, Maggie is relieved but she continues with her wedding duties.  They were a singing duo named Colby and Case, making their way through Nashville and ready to hit the big time.  The music was going well but he stressed out so much.  The constant changes made Maggie calm up on stage.  They lost their record deal and the relationship soon followed.  Maggie retreated to Piedmont Island and Jake became a producer in Nashville.  While helping Jennifer with the wedding, Jake is trying to put the finishing touches on Ashleigh Z's album.  With the slow internet connection, he may not get it done it time.  Maggie will help him see that relaxing is key by dancing, singing, and the guitar.  They will find love and their path while making beautiful music together.<br/><br/>Following the Hallmark format, this movie does have some differences.  In this movie, the male is overstressed and the female is telling him to relax.  She helps him see how slowing down can help him see the beauty around him and be more creative.  The scenery and wedding decorations are exquisite. With all that, it's the last few minutes of this movie that truly make you fall in love with it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

It brings up Daniel’s, formerly Bruce, past during the movie but you don’t have to watch the first one to understand what is going on.  You see the ticking timebomb in Daniel but you are intrigued by it.  He is not just stalking Alison, he is stalking his past.
