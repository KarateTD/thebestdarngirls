    "review":"Ali works at and owns the local salon with her mother, Carol, and sister, Chelsea.  As usual, the salon is buzzing with the latest town gossip.  And it's at an all-time high because the Ms. Golden Peak pageant will start soon.  And they are all talking about the pageant's owner, Mitzi.  While Ali credits Mitzi with the salon's success, everyone else considers Mitzi power-hungry because she owns half the town.  Then Mitzi walks into the shop, and they are on their best behavior.  When Sterling arrives, Mitzi asks him about removing her oak tree.  And she threatens to fire him if he doesn't.  Then, Darren, the pageant's host, walks in with a tremendous announcement.  He got the job as a weatherman in Boise.  During his news, Ali hears Sarah and Olivia arguing.  They are stage moms who competed against each other in the pageant's past.  Mitzi stops them and reminds them that she expects her contestants to be better.  Then Mitzi spots Chelsea.  She thinks Chelsea is an unconventional beauty who could win the contest and tells Chelsea to enter.<br/><br/>Then Sheriff Fred walks over and introduces the newcomer, Detective Kyle.  Kyle can't believe Fred uses Ali for intel, but Fred knows everyone comes to her salon and talks.<br/><br/>At the pageant, Mitzi calls Kyle because someone broke into Mitzi's office.  They didn't steal anything, but they threw things around.  Then, Mitzi pulls her director, Dan, aside and reminds him that she is in charge.  The pageant's caterer, Arnold, begs Mitzi not to split his business.  Mitzi walks over to Lisa and tells her she is out of the pageant.  Someone told Mitzi that Lisa's GPA was 3.4999, and it should be 3.5 or higher.  When Lisa tells Olivia, Olivia sees Sarah with a smile on her face.  Moments later, they all hear a scream.  Mitzi is dead with a pair of scissors on her back.  The scissors have Rachel's name engraved on them.  When Kyle has them tested, they have Chelsea's prints on them.  Ali takes Kyle's suspicions personally when her sister and stylist are at the top of the suspect list.  She will take a hail of gunfire to prove them innocent.<br/><br/>One of the few original movies not based on a book is coming out strong.  It presents a dynamic storyline with lots of suspects, a villainous victim, and an overarching story for more movies to come.  The film introduces the new cast with solid timing and intriguing backstories.  As clients sit in Ali's chair, you will sit closer to the screen, wanting to know all while pulling their story apart for clues.  Add this movie to your DVR list and keep room for it.  It will be one of your favorites.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
