    "review":"Blair comes to headquarters at the end of the day and sees her dad, Jim, looking stressed. He explains that the company won't make it to spring. Jim wants to declare bankruptcy so they can pay their workers one more check, but Blair has a secret project with her friend, Quinn. It will guarantee the company a year of work.<br/><br/>Blair meets with Mayor Maya to tell Maya about her plan. She wants to build a tiny home village for homeless residents. This project will ease the shelter's strain and give the homeless a sense of pride and a house. Blair describes the 250-square-foot structures as transition homes. Maya loves the idea, but Blair must convince Mr. Adams to get on board. Maya tells Blair to build a sample home, but they can't give Blair funding for it. Blair and Quinn get to work.<br/><br/>Mason walks into a coffee shop and sees Jim sitting at the table. They catch up, and Jim tells Mason to come to say hi to Blair. Mason unknowingly walks into Blair's meeting with Maya and Mr. Adams. They recognize Mason from TV and assume he is part of the project. Mason goes with the flow, but Blair pulls him into a backroom and wants to know why Mason is stealing her project. He says he has no idea what's happening, but she doesn't trust him because of their past. A few years ago, producer Jared picked Mason and Blair to run a renovation show. After the first season, Blair left and ended their relationship. Jared wants Mason to sign his season 3 contract before the new year, but Mason has doubts. He came home to figure things out. Mason agrees to work with Blair to keep up appearances. Can they fool the government and Hollywood? Or are they fooling themselves?<br/><br/>The setup for this movie is sad for everyone. However, they never say the word 'homeless.' They say 'shelterless' or without a place. Blair is a great businesswoman and builder, but she can't speak her mind in a relationship. Viewers get exhausted with the back and forth and look forward to seeing the home. Once you see it, you won't care about the protagonists because you know the outcome.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Annie returns to North Haven for two weeks to spend time with her family. Her father, Frank, and her aunt, Claire, welcome Annie with food, hugs, and matching Christmas pajamas. Annie wants to keep busy by volunteering. She is up for a job promotion to Project Manager at Helping Initiative.<br/><br/>Her family wants Annie to spend time with them doing North Haven's Christmas Countdown activities, but she won't take a vacation from helping. Most of her family is disappointed Annie won't be spending time with them, but Claire offers Annie a project. The local animal rescue sent a flyer to foster a dog for the holidays. Annie finds the owner, Gary, crying because he had to close the animal rescue. He didn't have a head for numbers and gave his animals to the local vet.

The county says he has too many cats and dogs. Annie contacts Gary and asks to see his numbers. She calculates and determines it will take $10,000 to save Gary's animal rescue. They must get the money by the 23rd, or the county will seize the animals. Can Dylan and Annie do it in time?<br/><br/>Of course, this movie has a romance between the protagonist, but the adopters and the family members are the standouts.

    "review":"Darcy returns home after another record company rejection. Darcy accepted an invitation to visit her sister, Gretchen, and niece, Megan. Megan is auditioning to join the Herald Angels. The Herald Angels are Megan's high school caroling group, and they gave Darcy her start. Darcy is proud to help Megan join the team. However, Megan is too shy to sing in front of them.<br/><br/>Adam and Rick sit in a coffee shop and celebrate the end of high school football season. However, Adam's caroling season will kick off today. His Herald Angels won the Caroling Competition for six straight years. He refuses to lose this year.<br/><br/>Darcy enters the school to pick up Megan and finds Megan crying in the hallway. The teacher didn't let Megan finish her song before he stopped her audition and told her she didn't have a place on the team. Megan won't accept that and stomps into the classroom to give the teacher a piece of her mind. The teacher is Adam, her old singing rival. When she became a pop star, Adam got a degree. He tells Darcy that Megan isn't ready and turns his back to her.<br/><br/>Darcy leaves and tells Megan she could be a better teacher than Adam because she can give the kids confidence. Darcy goes to Principal Dixon and asks to start a second caroling group. Adam comes in to reject this idea and says it violates the competition's rules. Darcy read the rules, and the rules state that a school can have two or more teams. However, the teams must compete in a sing-off to determine who will be in the Caroling Competition. Darcy and Adam are at odds again. What team will come out on top?<br/><br/>The one-liners are well-written and funny. Also, the plot has a mini conclusion for the sing-off before the Caroling Competition. This mini conclusion allows Darcy and Adam to fall in love organically. While their love is the focal point, the movie is about giving these kids confidence. Seeing them grow and find their path is inspiring.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
