She had a few days to convince Chase Devine to let her keep the garden for the community.  He has a few days to convince her the condos are great for the community.  Who will win?<br/><br/>This movie packs a lot of laughs and heart.  It's great to see that the developer isn't portrayed has mean but a person that wants to help.
