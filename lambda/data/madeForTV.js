    "mtitle":"Wendy Williams: The Movie",
    "review":"Wendy Williams grew up as the tallest, heaviest, and only black girl on the block, and her parents never let her forget it. At the store, she would see the gossip rags.  Wendy wanted to be one of the rich and thin celebrities on the cover.  During her sophomore year in college, she got her first radio show. Soon, she is playing the contemporary hits and calling the shots.  It wasn't until later that Wendy found her winning formula.  She turned her love of tabloid magazines into a tell-all radio show about Hip Hop and R and B artists. After her first marriage, Wendy enjoys the single life.  Then, she meets Kevin Hunter. He made himself indispensable in her life as a manager, promoter, counselor, and bodyguard. While Wendy focuses on her rise to the top with Kevin, she has yet to understand he will be her most dominant anchor.  Between miscarriages, emotional abuse, and affairs, Wendy will have to summon all her strength to practice what she preaches.<br/><br/>Wendy only holds back three things from this movie: her son, her first marriage, and her rapist's name.  Otherwise, Wendy exposes her raw and unfiltered self from her formative years to now. Wendy talks about rape, abortion, miscarriages, stillbirth, Eric B, abuse, Kevin, the rise to the top, drug addiction, hyperthyroidism, Grave's disease, on-air fainting, and her family.  She puts it all on the table and took control of her life story. You are in for one hell of a ride, and no, you don't know her story.  So, watch and have your tea ready.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Dana works as an investigative journalist at the Seattle True Press.  Instead of working on her yoga poses with her boyfriend, Jon, Dana finishes her latest article in the middle of yoga class.  Before Jon can complain, Dana runs out of the yoga class and back to work because she got a hot tip.  Dana enters her rideshare and sees another man inside.  Since the car is blocked in, Dana gets out and decides to walk to work.  She got proof that a social media company puts its users’ private information at risk.  The owner, Mr. Gonzales, has never been a public figure and doesn’t answer questions.  Dana’s editor, Katherine, knows Dana is going on a yoga retreat with Jon to Bali.  But Dana refuses to let anyone scoop her, so she insists on working on the article while on vacation.  She secretly packs her phone and work computer into her bags and gets on the plane, but the weather dumbfounds Dana.  Dana doesn’t understand why Bali is so cold.  That’s because she is not in Bali, she’s in Canada.  Their guru for the week is Nicola, and Jon connects with her instantly.  On the bus, she notices the man whose face she has seen before.  He introduces himself as Stefan, the man she almost shared the rideshare with earlier.  Halfway there, Dana drops her purse with her computer and phone inside, and it lands in a pond.  Frustrated, Jon ends the relationship.  Since Stefan came alone, Nicola paired Stefan with Dana for all the activities.  With Dana’s beginner status, Stefan has his work cut out for him.  Seeing she is a tech addict, he bets she can’t get into the zone and commit to yoga.  Dana takes his challenge.  With his aloof behavior, she starts to track him and fall for him.  Stefan sneaks in food, has WiFi and access to anything he wants.  Dana wants to learn more about him.  However, when she discovers the truth about Stefan, can she believe him or will she trust her sources?<br/><br/>This movie is a great romantic comedy that makes the main character the work-seeking, neglectful partner.  Dana will work at any time and any place, so the viewer understands why Jon wants to break up with her.  Stefan connects with her because he understands her desire to work.  He praises her while guiding her.  You will enjoy it too.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Winter Getaway",
    "review":"Courtney works for Belle La Vie as a personal concierge for the uber-rich.  She handles every demand, request, and whim, no matter how big or how small.  After putting the finishing touches on her latest client’s request, Courtney’s boss, Dana, calls Courtney into her office.  One of Dana’s employees left to start a company with 2 hours notice.  The employee left notes about the next client, Joe Franklin, with a platinum package request to Canada.  Dana asks Courtney to take over for the employee and to make sure Joe has every experience, no matter how lavish.  Then she meets Joe.  For a rich man, Courtney notices that Joe acts like a fish out of water.  He requests root beer instead of champagne, doesn’t know where to put his luggage, and plays with the seats.  Courtney helps Joe get settled and plans his days in advance.  Small problem: her plans are too upscale for Joe.  Courtney doesn’t know that the trip was for billionaire Alan and his wife, but Alan had to attend a last-minute conference.  So, Alan gave the vacation to his best friend, Joe, for Joe’s birthday and his broken heart.  The more time Joe spends with Courtney, he starts to fall for her, but Joe worries she wants the rich guy she thinks he is.  Since Courtney thinks Joe is rich and a client, she ignores her growing feelings for him.  It will take a fairy godmother and godfather to bring these two together.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy how the other half does vacation.  On one hand, you will fall in love with the accommodations, but Courtney’s menu, on the other hand, not so much.  Joe wants pancakes and eggs for breakfast, but she pre-orders food he can’t pronounce.  Courtney falls for him because his ‘everyday man’ mystique is appealing yet unexpected.  He falls for her because she is open-minded and fun.  As you cheer for this couple, they bond over root beer and poutine.  This film will be your favorite movie this season.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Salt-N-Pepa",
    "review":"In 1985, at Queensborough Community College, Sandy walked in for spades and asked Cheryl if she knew how to play.  Cheryl turned down Sandy's offer because handing out Sears applications were her focus. A week later, Sandy walks into the call room and gets a seat next to Cheryl, and Cheryl introduces her to several teammates. At home, Cheryl's boyfriend, Herbie, wants to make a response-diss rap for The Show like Roxanne's Revenge did for Roxanne.  He believes the rap will put them on the map, especially if they do it as an Ashford and Simpson duet.  Herbie gets in the studio with Cheryl, but their voices don't sound good together.  So he gets an idea, they need another girl.  Cheryl remembers Sandy. Within six weeks, their song, The Showstoppers, is on the radio and in heavy rotation.  Promoters hire them at local clubs, bars, and high schools to perform.  Fans are calling them Salt-N-Pepa because of a line in the song.  Herbie decides that Cheryl will be Salt, and Sandy will be Pepa. They get a DJ called Spinderella and record their first album.  With the song Push It, they become household names but boyfriends, money, self-mutilation, eating disorders, partying, legal disputes, faith, and arguments over significance become dominant hurdles in the group.  After the dust settles, will there be a Salt-N-Pepa?<br/><br/>With some so-so casting and lack of Spinderella, the movie gets off to a bumpy start.  However, the plot discusses the personal fallout of the group as its popularity rises.  That's when the story gets real.  The women claim they are better at solving other people's problems than theirs.  And that rings true during their friendship. Cheryl starts to have a crisis of faith, while Sandy's is money. But through a male-dominated industry, their biggest opponents were themselves and each other.  So, sit back, enjoy this movie, and learn.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Wrong Prince Charming",
    "review":"Anna works hard as the lead legal counsel and vice president of Davis Real Estate.  Her boss, Bridget, walks into the conference room with an exciting announcement, Prince Edward of Devonshire wants to invest in their property.  So Bridget scheduled a meeting with Prince Edward and the controller of Devonshire holdings, Liam. At the meeting, Edward and Liam inform Bridget and Anna that they will invest $300 million into the project, but first, Davis Real Estate has to put $30 million in an escrow account to trigger a loss and avoid taxes. After the meeting, Anna meets with her best friend, Heather, for coffee, and Mia approaches them.  Mia warns Anna that Prince Edward isn't who he says he is and leaves her business card. The next day, Anna tells Bridget that she finished the paperwork and everything looks good.  Bridget sets up another appointment for Anna to be with Edward alone. Edward is more concerned with Anna than the numbers, but he guarantees the deal is as good as done.  That's because the agreement is fake.  Edward and Liam are con-artists.  They stole $200,000 from Mia and moved on for a bigger payday.  It will take a slip of the tongue, two missing people, and a concerned step-sister to bring Edward and Liam's deceitful ways to light.<br/><br/>So two lessons come from this movie.  First, pay attention to internet articles.  And second, never try to dodge Uncle Sam.  At first, it's easy to give up on this movie because you believe you know the setup.  However, the mouse becomes the cat and vice versa. And that's when things get interesting.  You will be sucked in and want a part two after the credits roll.  And yes, you do get the classic line.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
