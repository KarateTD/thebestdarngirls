    "mtitle": "Abducted at an HBCU: A Black Girl Missing Movie",
    "review": "Ellen jogs on the Errington College track when her student, Shannon, challenges her to a race. Shannon easily defeats her advisor. They laugh, and Shannon asks to use Ellen's computer to write a paper. Ellen says yes without hesitation.<br/><br/>Shannon comes to Ellen's office, and they talk. Shannon admits she feels out of place because the other students have money. Ellen doesn't pry because Shannon is a straight-A student. Ellen asks Shannon to meet her after Thanksgiving for lunch. Shannon accepts with a smile.<br/><br/>After Thanksgiving break, Shannon doesn't come to Ellen's office for lunch. Then, Shannon's teacher calls Ellen. Shannon missed the midterm, didn't turn in homework, and didn't attend class. Ellen knows something is wrong and goes to the dean. The dean assumes Shannon dropped out and doesn't offer help. Ellen's worried someone kidnapped Shannon. And Ellen's correct.<br/><br/>For weeks, King seduced and learned about Shannon. She revealed that she has no friends or family and doesn't live in the dorm. He drugged her drink during dinner and chained her inside a trailer. He will sell her in 12 days to the highest bidder. Ellen has 12 days to save Shannon, but can she get anyone else to care?<br/><br/>Ellen is an advisor who goes above and beyond for her students. Shannon falls through the cracks on campus but is on Ellen's radar. She gets stellar grades but doesn't speak to her professors. King fakes a relationship to gain her trust. He sees Shannon as an easy mark. Her time in captivity will make your flesh crawl as King taunts, assaults, and belittles her. The movie states race disparities among missing women in the media and offers ways campuses can improve security. Lifetimers can spot the script's foreshadowing, so it eases the ticking clock. Viewers can use this film to teach college-bound students about predator techniques.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Lies and Ex Wives: Secrets of Maple Street",
    "review": "The people of Maple Street gather for a barbeque and gossip about Katie, the new woman on the block. Now, their side eyes turn to stares because Katie is newly engaged to Scott. Everyone remembers Scott's ex-wife, Hazel. Although Hazel cheated, now they keep their distance from Katie. Hazel, Scott, and Katie remain civil for Hazel and Scott's kids, Archer and Alexis.<br/><br/>Katie goes outside and finds a note that reads, 'I know who you are.' She asks the gardener, Charlie, if he saw anyone lurking, and Charlie says no. Later that night, someone enters their home and grabs Katie. Katie fights off the attacker, the attacker escapes, and Scott calls the police. Detective Vaughn arrives and questions Scott and Katie. Scott thinks the attacker is Hazel, and Scott B lines to Hazel's home.<br/><br/>Scott tells Hazel to stay away from their home, but she swears she doesn't know what he's talking about. Days later, Detective Vaughn knocks on their door. She hasn't caught Katie's attacker, but she has unfortunate news. Someone killed Hazel and stuffed her body in an ice cream truck's freezer. They worry Scott is Detective Vaughn's number one suspect, but evidence points to Katie. Can Scott and Katie prove their innocence?<br/><br/>Please remember this movie is the first in the Maple Street series. The opening sequence paints the idyllic suburban life of manicured lawns, happy homemakers, and loving couples. But when the night falls, viewers see the seedy underbelly of drugs, affairs, and schemes. The exposition introduces the audience to the pivotal couples for the upcoming films. So, the climax feels slow, but it will spread across several films. This mystery is fun, and the characters are entertaining. If you are into franchise films, this piece is best for you. Otherwise, you may feel it's too slow.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Rescuing Christmas",
    "review": "Elves Chuck and Debbie wanted to leave North Pole Human Resources and move to the Toy Department, so they created Operation Wish. Debbie and Chuck want to convert the grumpiest person by giving them 3 Christmas wishes. They present the idea to Santa, and he loves it. He asks if they have anyone in mind. They chose Erin from Duluth, MN. They use a magical radio station to infiltrate Erin's everyday life about the Operation Wish contest.<br/><br/>Photographer Erin keeps up the holiday pace for her parents, Lou and Diana, her friends, Maria and Tyler, and their children, Jonah and Olivia. Maria remembers when Erin's favorite holiday was Christmas until her ex-boyfriend, Archie, dumped her last Christmas. Tyler and Maria ask Erin to meet them for dinner and surprise her with a blind date, Sam. She runs home to finish work and gets an email from the magical radio station. The email states that she won the Operation Wish contest. Erin wishes for Diana's holiday pizzelle. A knock at the door startles Erin. It's Diana with holiday pizzelle. Later, Sam tries to get Erin into the holiday spirit, but it doesn't work. He hands her an old roll of film and asks her to develop it for him. She happily accepts.<br/><br/>Erin gets a notice that Archie won a highly-coveted photography fellowship for nature images. Archie belittled Erin for taking nature photos, and now he gets an award for them. Also, Archie didn't thank Erin for her inspiration. Later, Erin wishes Tyler would give her credit, and he knocks on her door. He wants to share the credit but persuades Erin to do the work. After a few days, Archie crosses the line and eats her pizzelle. Erin's final wish is for Christmas to disappear.<br/><br/>The North Pole goes into red alert, and the General Counsel enters. Erin's wish caused a ripple effect worldwide and made Christmas disappear for everyone. If Erin doesn't wish Christmas back by December 25th, it will become a forgotten holiday. Santa, Debbie, and Chuck fly to Minnesota to rescue Christmas. In Minnesota, Erin wakes up, and her holiday decorations are gone. She finds a roll of film Sam gave her days earlier and develops them. It's pictures of Sam celebrating the mythical holiday as a child. He believes Erin and decides to rescue Christmas with her.<br/><br/>Erin has average holiday frustrations, but heartbreak amplifies them. She makes her wish but doesn't understand how it would affect everyone else. Erin can't stand the thought of Olivia and Jonah missing the holiday. She goes on a mission that ignites the town. And it will make you laugh. The romance angle is unnecessary to the plot and feels forced. However, Rescuing Christmas is a delight.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sister Wife Murder",
    "review": "Chloe's mother, Lois, yells at Chloe to wake up for work. Since Chloe's father died, Chloe's life has been in a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol, and parties. Lois won't allow Chloe to lay around the house. She tells Chloe to get out of bed, get a job, and attend church.<br/><br/>Chloe gazes at Caleb preaching the word at the pulpit and becomes entranced. Afterward, Caleb pulls Chloe aside and discusses ways she can get involved in the church. Also, he runs a foundation called Sacred Heart, which helps needy families. He offers Chloe a job, and she says yes.<br/><br/>Margo meets Chloe at Sacred Heart and shows Chloe around the office. Chloe meets with her friends, Alexis and Dalton, and drones about Caleb. Alexis reminds Chloe he is a married man. Chloe laughs because she was only looking.<br/><br/>Chloe gets familiar with Sacred Heart while spending time with Caleb. Soon, Caleb and Chloe become intimate. However, Chloe doesn't want to be his dirty secret and wants to know if they have a future. Caleb explains that his wife, Anna, knows about their relationship. Chloe pretends to accept the arrangement, but her jealousy grows. Later, Caleb asks Chloe to skip Alexis's party for a retreat. He convinces Chloe to say yes.<br/><br/>Chloe shares her hardships with the retreat attendees and connects with Anna and Caleb. Chloe wakes at night and walks around the canteen. She finds Caleb kissing Margo and runs out of the room. Caleb admits he is married to Margo and Anna and wants Chloe to join their family. They invite Chloe to dinner to meet everyone and see how they live. After dinner, Chloe leaves home, marries Caleb, and becomes a sister-wife. She believes she is following God's path. But the devil has her fooled, and one sister-wife pays the ultimate price.<br/><br/>This movie spends time on character development to make Chloe's change from party girl to sister-wife believable. Once Chloe is in the home, it doesn't take long for cracks to form. Your skin will crawl when Caleb defends his abusive actions with the bible. Then, you will wait for each woman to see the light. This film is entertaining, but the murder takes time because of well-written character development.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
