    "mtitle": "Search for a Serial Killer: The Regina Smith Story",
    "review": "Regina Smith left her husband. She tells her mother that she and her daughter, Nikki, will stay with her friend, Ester. Regina turns on the radio and hears a public announcement. The police and fire department seek African American women to join the ranks. Regina signs up and takes basic training. After a grueling start, Regina passes.<br/><br/>The captain wants someone to do community outreach. He picks Regina and Eddie to meet with local business owners and townspeople. During their outreach, a store owner complains about the prostitutes across the street. Regina walks over to the prostitutes and recognizes a few of them. She collects their information and provides comfort.<br/><br/>Regina and Eddie continue to patrol the neighborhood. They find a crack house, and Regina grabs boards and nails to seal the home. Eddie argues with Regina about putting herself in danger, and they spot a body in the grass. Regina recognizes the woman as one of the prostitutes from her neighborhood. Regina tells the detective that she wants to warn the other prostitutes, but the detective tells Regina to back down. After someone finds another body, Regina hopes the newspapers will report it. They dash her dreams when they bury the story. Regina refuses to let anyone hurt her girls. She vows to find the Eyeball Killer.<br/><br/>Lt. Regina Smith leads with compassion. She sees the world write these women off because of their profession and addictions. Eddie's character feels distant, but he grows. The movie discusses Regina's and the killer's backstories. However, this film doesn't go into the gory details of the crime. It focuses on Regina's work-life balance, investigative superpower, and love life. She and Eddie made the streets safer for all women.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trivia at St. Nick's",
    "review": "Astronomy professor Celeste rambles about the annual Christmas Trivia contest at St. Nick's Bar to her teaching assistant, Ruby. Teams of 6 compete in a tournament over several days. Celeste's crush, Richard, joined the team because he won Jeopardy twice. Celeste reminds him the group will meet tonight, and he requests a practice schedule.<br/><br/>Celeste meets with her team. They will sign up today. Before they enter, Richard runs in with astounding news. He is going to Asia tomorrow. Celeste panics. They must have six members for their team. Celeste runs around campus to find a replacement. She settles on Ruby. But other teaching assistants convinced Ruby to play and name their team We Came to Slay.<br/><br/>Football offensive coach Max enters St. Nick's and asks to sit at their table. Celeste remembers Max as the rude, self-important buffet line jumper. She tells him no. The trivia game starts. The first question is about sports. Sherry runs over to Max, brings him to the table. After six questions, the team places third and wants him to stay. Celeste must get Max to take the tournament seriously because winning is her most important priority. However, Max wants Celeste to find the fun in winning. Can they change each other's minds and hearts?<br/><br/>Celeste is a bit overzealous, but she loves trivia. She misjudged Max as a dumb jock who doesn't care about the rules or studying. Max proves her wrong. Max believes Celeste is too tense. However, he sees she cares deeply about something and holds on. He falls for her competitive spirit as she embraces his winning edge. Hallmarkies will laugh at the Hallmark movie references. So watch and be ready to compete.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Cassie apologizes to her husband, Steven, for her daughter's bratty behavior. Cassie's ex-husband, Lyle, thinks it's time for their daughter, Ariel, to live with him. Cassie politely rejects his suggestion.<br/><br/>Cassie relaxes in the tub when she hears a noise. She investigates and gets startled by her sister, Miranda. Cassie sees Miranda's black eye and asks Miranda if Rufus hit her. Miranda doesn't want to elaborate on the abuse and questions Cassie about helping their brother, Kevin. Miranda begs Cassie to forgive and help Kevin. But Cassie says no because Kevin has a gambling addiction and refuses to seek help.<br/><br/>After a long day at work, Cassie returns home and catches Miranda giving Ariel beer. Miranda apologizes and requests a girls' night out. However, Cassie wants to rest. So Miranda goes out alone.<br/><br/>Ariel can't find Miranda in the guest bedroom. Cassie texts Miranda but doesn't get a response and goes to work. Kevin is waiting for her. He asks Cassie for money, but she says no. He breaks items in her office and retreats. Cassie returns home, and Steven files a restraining order against Kevin. Then, Steven uses his District Attorney position to have the police track Miranda's phone. The trace leads the police to Rufus's truck. When Detective Andrews appears at Cassie's doorstep, Cassie expects good news. However, Detective Andrews reports someone found Cassie's remains in an alley. Cassie won't wait for the police to uncover the truth. She will find it in a world of lies, texts, and sex clubs.<br/><br/>The title doesn't match the movie's plot, but the body count is high. With every step forward Cassie makes in the case, another person dies. The final fight scene is funny, but the plot is compelling. Viewers can guess who the murderer is, so you watch to prove you're correct. This film won't be a favorite, but it's worth a rainy day watch.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
