    "mtitle":"The Good Father: The Martin MacNeill Story",
    "review":"Alexis comes home from medical school to visit her family.  Her mother, Michelle, pulls Alexis aside.  Michelle thinks her husband, Martin, is having an affair and asks Alexis to pull his phone records. Martin explains the woman is Jillian Willis, a nursing student, and she took over their rental property.  And he spent so much time at the hospital because the doctors diagnosed him with cancer.  Alexis believes her father, but Michelle still can't get rid of that uneasy feeling.  Later, Michelle tells Alexis that she plans on getting a facelift.  While it was Martin's suggestion, Michelle is all too happy to do it. Alexis goes back to school, but the next day, Martin calls her home.  Her mother died.  The medical examiner believes it was heart disease, but Alexis isn't sure of this diagnosis.  After Michelle's funeral, Martin runs into an old patient named Gypsy. Martin believes this is a stroke of luck.  He was looking for a nanny, so Alexis could go back to school instead of caring for her three younger sisters.  But this luck feels like a trap to Alexis, so she asks for Gypsy's ID.  When she looks it over, the name on the ID is Jillian Willis. She wants to believe Martin wouldn't kill her mother, but she has no idea of the depths of his depravity.  Good thing she has aunt Linda on her side.<br/><br/>Alexis had to grow up too fast in her family. She played referee between them while being a nanny and medical student.  When Alexis learns the truth about Martin, she discovers that an affair is the tip of the iceberg. She wants to believe in her father.  But one night, he destroys all her hope by assaulting her. If you think this movie is twisted, it barely scratched the surface of what Martin did to his family.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Under Wraps",
    "review":"Gilbert and Marshall are best friends with very different interests. One thing they are excited about is seeing the ancient Egyptian exhibit at the natural history museum.  Their teacher partners the students together but see that Amy is the odd one out.  So the teacher pairs Amy with Gilbert and Marshall. During the museum visit, Gilbert tells Amy about their scary neighbor, Mr. Kubot.  They saw him taking something out of a van that was big and shaped like a body. Amy wants to set up a post and watch Mr. Kubot's home.<br/><br/>During the stakeout, Marshall convinces Gilbert to go inside to look around.  Gilbert finds the coffin and the mummy.  Gilbert reaches for the mummy's amulet to get a closer look but pulls the mummy on top of himself. As the mummy lay on the basement floor, the moonlight shines on the amulet and awakens the mummy.  The mummy walks out of the home and into Marshall's front lawn.  As the kids try to hide the mummy, they learn that they have three days to get him back in his coffin or he will die. And thanks to a missing inhaler, Mr. Kubot is on their trail, and he wants his mummy back.<br/><br/>The remaking of Disney's Under Wraps is a combination of The Mummy and Encino Man.  It's an easy watch with kids but doesn't require much attention from adults.  Unlike most Disney Channel products, this movie isn't a musical. With the mummy and theft at the storyline's forefront, this movie includes a moment for family and love.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Daniella is a high-powered entertainment lawyer with a skill for compiling secrets for or against her clients.  Her hard-nosed style is constantly at odds with her sorority sister, District Attorney Beverly Rucker, and her co-worker, Joshua. Later that night, Daniella and Arnold attend a party for Isis's album release.  Daniella has been Isis's lawyer since the beginning of Isis's career and sees Isis as a little sister.  So seeing Isis together with her controlling boyfriend, Lewis, makes Daniella sick to her stomach. Daniella congratulates Isis and Isis's manager, Larry, on the success.<br/><br/>After the party, Tamika, Daniella's assistant, has horrific news.  Someone attacked Isis in her home, and Isis is on life support.  Daniella knows who to blame: Lewis. With no witness or a weapon, all the evidence is circumstantial.  The best Beverly can do, charge him with misdemeanor assault if they find Lewis, and Isis IDs him as her attacker.  Daniella can't hide her fury.  She vows to track Lewis down and make him pay, and she will uncover every secret in the industry to get him.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why BET turned this movie into a series.  This movie is Empire mixed with Law and Order and Scandal.  While Daniella is on the hunt for Lewis, her past haunts her nightmares. When Daniella was a child, both of her parents died in an accident.  However, her nightmares make her believe she was in the car when they died.  While trying to fix her client's lives, she must work on hers without falling apart.  And it takes a funeral for Daniella to come full circle.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

With this new interruption in his life, this structured man will see the beauty in flaws and find his passion for gemstones.  But his past isn't too far behind.<br/><br/>Based on Rise and Shine, Benedict Stone by Phaedra Patrick, this mysterious outsider wasn't a mystery at all.  Your creativity will make for a better story than this film.  It does have some beautiful imagery and intriguing facts about gemstones, but that's it. This movie just fell flat with expectations.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
