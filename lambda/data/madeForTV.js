    "mtitle":"Paging Mr. Darcy",
    "review":"Professor Dr. Eloise disembarks the plane and looks forward to the Jane Austen annual conference and ball. Eloise will be the keynote speaker but has another opportunity in mind. Professor Jennings, who sits on Princeton's Hiring Committee and is an Austen scholar, will attend. Eloise wants to get in her good graces and get the position as the foremost leading Austen scholar. Eloise stands dumbfounded when she sees a man dressed like Mr. Darcy holding a sign with her name. He is her guest of honor liaison and offers to drive her to the conference. While others cosplay at this conference, Eloise considers it ridiculous. Eloise waits outside, and Sam, a.k.a. Mr. Darcy, sits beside her. He apologizes for embarrassing her and drives to the remote location.<br/><br/>She locates Professor Jennings in the dining room and introduces herself but doesn't mention the job. Jennings laughs about the festivities and bucks at anyone who doesn't revel in the fun. Eloise nervously laughs, and Jennings waves over Sam. Eloise embarrassingly hides behind her hand, and Jennings introduces Sam as her nephew. Sam pretends that Eloise loves the dress-up, balls, and lawn games. However, he plays up the façade for a reason. An actor, Krispen, spends an excessive amount of time with Jennings. If Jennings hires him, she could become a laughingstock at Princeton. Sam wants Jennings to hire Eloise. So, he will ensure Eloise plays to Jennings's liking. Can Eloise and Sam stay in character and get the job before Jennings discovers the truth?<br/><br/>Inspired by Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Jane Austen fans can quickly infer which film characters derive from the novel. Eloise discovers having fun can help her connect to the books she loves and the author she admires. As Eloise lets her hair down, viewers will laugh and want to join the celebration. And if you listen carefully, you can hear Sam reveal his heartbreaking past. Also, Eloise's take-charge attitude comes from teasing and family duty. This film has a lot to unpack but captivates.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emma Vanderbilt-Cross hands her completed article to her boss, Mr. Milford, on the politics of Susan B. Anthony. However, Milford wants Emma to rewrite it to focus on Susan's fashion, not the cause. Emma grinds her teeth and drafts another article. Before she leaves, Emma gets an invite to Gertrude's coming out party. They trust Emma because she is family and a Vanderbilt.<br/><br/>Emma attends the party with her brother, Brady Cross. Their aunt Alice and uncle Cornelius greet Emma with a smile but boldly ignore Brady. Emma runs to Gertrude's side because Gertrude looks unhappy. Alice and Cornelius are upset because Gertrude's brother, Neily, is interested in Grace. They don't consider Grace an optimal choice for Neily and threaten to cut him off.<br/><br/>Emma stands on the dancefloor and catches a stranger's eye. Before the stranger can introduce himself, Cornelius's business advisor, Mr. Goddard, asks for a dance. During the dance, Emma mentions she has the Vanderbilt name but won't inherit the wealth. Mr. Goddard excuses himself to put Cornelius's lucrative railroad plans in the safe.<br/><br/>Emma looks around the room and sees an old friend, Adelaide. Emma apologizes for missing Adelaide's wedding to Rupert, and Adelaide quickly forgives Emma. Rupert demands Adelaide retrieve his walking cane. Adelaide sighs and leaves the room. Emma notices an open door during Alice and Cornelius's toast for Gertrude. Emma walks through the door and hears someone arguing above her. Then she hears a sickening thud. She turns and sees Mr. Goddard dead on the ground.<br/><br/>Detective Jesse examines the scene with Harriet. She finds a gilded shard in the wound and determines someone struck Mr. Goddard before he fell over the balcony. Emma informs Jesse that the area with the balcony is Cornelius's office. They run upstairs to find Brady unconscious on the floor with a gilded candlestick in his hand. Jesse arrests Brady for murder. Emma believes the culprit set up Brady and took the plans before killing Mr. Goddard. But can she prove it?<br/><br/>Based on Murder at the Breakers by Alyssa Maxwell, the movie has the challenge of solving a crime without modern-day technology. She utilizes her wit and connections to move within the inner circle. But Emma has to do it with the elegance of a woman of her era. The perpetrator may be easy to decipher for some, but it's fun to watch Emma find the clues. This film is a solid introduction to the characters, era, and style. It has room for growth while entertaining.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sabotaging the Squad",
    "review":"Missy gleefully shares the news with her daughter, Arielle. Missy got the job as head coach of the 360s. Missy cheered for them early in her career, and now Arielle wants to carry the torch. The two happily pack and move.<br/><br/>Missy unpacks her kitchen and finds her friend, Gemma, standing there. Gemma and Missy cheered together and were co-captain and captain, respectively. So, Missy hires Gemma as her assistant coach. Gemma jumps at the offer.<br/><br/>Gemma enters the training facility with Missy and Arielle. Sasha, the facility's manager, introduces himself. He replaced the old coach, Darlene, with Missy because the famed 360s didn't make regionals. Tawnya, the mayor's wife, beams as she watches her daughter, Fiona, practice. And Darlene and Tawnya love to spend time and drink with Candi. Gemma warns Missy that Candi, Darlene, and Tawnya will be difficult.<br/><br/>Missy pulls the cheerleaders aside and informs them that everyone has to earn their spot. Darlene, Candi, and Tawnya become angry. Later, the women disseminate a picture of Missy hugging Sasha on the internet and infer they are having an affair. Missy barrels to Tawnya's home and lays down the law. Missy leaves with satisfaction, but the women have more devious plans. And, someone is dangerous. They will drug, sabotage, and kill to control the squad. Will Missy survive?<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about this movie. The heroine, Missy, is a take-charge, no-nonsense woman who won't let these cheer moms disrupt her practice and performances. The overall mystery falls flat. The average Lifetime watcher can see the villain coming from a mile away. And the motive is petty. So, viewers should watch this movie for Missy's nurturing and commanding demeanor. Otherwise, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie leaves work and grabs dinner to celebrate her anniversary, but the card declines twice. She gives the hostess another card and goes home. Alan pretends to be stuck at work but surprises Maggie. He gets in his Corvette and drives away. Maggie brings the leftovers to her neighbor, Selma, and Selma asks for a favor. Selma needs a ride to a mall 40 minutes away for a date. Maggie agrees.<br/><br/>After Maggie drops Selma off, she sees Alan's car drive past. She follows it to an unknown home and enters the garage. A woman, Pam, enters the garage with a knife, demanding an explanation and threatening to call the police. Pam states the vehicle belongs to her husband, Alan. The women compare pictures and realize they are married to the same man.<br/><br/>Pam has an idea to learn about Alan's finances. They go to his job and trick the payroll person into giving Alan's banking establishment. He informs Pam that Alan needs to change the beneficiary in the company's system. The name they have is Kristin. She's Alan's 3rd wife. They go to the bank to withdraw Alan's money for revenge. But their names aren't on the account. Heather, Alan's 4th wife, is. Pam and Maggie are out for blood and won't stop until Alan pays. Can they stay ahead of the man who fooled them for years?<br/><br/>Wow, this movie is the classic Lifetime fans want and need. Pam and Maggie could fight and blame each other, but they quickly band together and focus on their collective enemy, Alan. Of course, more wives add unseen wrinkles and complications to their plans because some wives have other angles. Each layer of this story will keep you on the edge of your seat and pearls clutched. This movie demands a permanent space on your DVR.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vivian and her co-workers, George and Justine, have been working on their app, The Perfect Match, for months. This app will ask questions about the individual and match people without pictures. Vivian wants to fine-tune the algorithm before presenting it to her boss, Westin.<br/><br/>Westin's mother, Judith, calls and wants an update on his division of her company. The technology sector's profits are steadily declining, and she wants results. Westin arrives late for work. So, his executive assistant, Adele, told the employees to start the marketing meeting without him. Westin saunters into the meeting and rejects all of Derek's ideas. Derek finds Vivian, and she pitches the app. Westin thinks it's perfect for a Valentine's Day release and will generate funds from suckers looking for love.<br/><br/>Westin's brother, Ben, has stupendous news. He got Westin a guest spot on a morning talk show to introduce the app. Ben tells Westin to invite Vivian along. Vivian comes to his office and says no. Adele pulls Vivian aside and explains how going on the show will help. Vivian agrees.<br/><br/>During the on-air interview, Westin tells the reporter they will do a soft launch of the app for the local area and then a U.S. rollout on Valentine's Day. The report asks if they believe in the app, and both say yes. Will the app find the perfect match for Westin and Vivian, or has it been before them all along?<br/><br/>Westin is a man avoiding love for business, like his mother. Vivian uses work to shield herself from the dating world. These two love-phobic people have to convince the world to find love. Judith is a terrific comic relief, and Michelle keeps the script grounded. However, romcom fans can predict what and when everything will happen. Watch this on Valentine's Day for a laugh with some wine.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
