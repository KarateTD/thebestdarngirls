    "mtitle":"Bad Behind Bars: Jodi Arias",
    "review":"Donavan Bering and Tracy Brown are in love and jail. As they wait for lunch, a new inmate walks into the pod. It's Jodi Arias. The world knows her as the blonde bombshell that killed her boyfriend, Travis Alexander. However, the inmates don't know about her crime because the jail controls their media intake. Tracy learns that Jodi will be bunking with her, and Tracy explodes. She thinks Jodi is a snitch sent to spy on them. Tracy runs into the cell and threatens Jodi, and the guards break them up.<br/><br/>After some time together, Tracy gives Jodi a loyalty test by asking Jodi to tattoo her. Jodi completes the tattoo, and Tracy trusts the young, pretty inmate. The three women are thick as thieves, and Tracy gets Jodi's name tattooed on her ankle. Then, Jodi presides over Donavan and Tracy's mock jailhouse wedding. Later, Donavan gets parole. Before Donavan leaves, Jodi makes her pledge to help with Jodi's social media campaign of innocence. Donavan humbly agrees, creates pages for Jodi, and contacts people worldwide for Jodi. Donavan believes she is doing the right thing by helping a friend, but Donavan's loyalty will ruin her relationships, job, and safety. And Tracy's tattoo will come back to haunt her and drive her to the brink.<br/><br/>While the movie is bland, it is a how-to guide for manipulation. Jodi is a social chameleon. She creates bonds over any topic: real or fake. Then, Jodi collects the life stories of others and uses them in her trial to give a false account of her childhood and Travis's background. The same tactics she used to lure Travis worked on Tracy, Donavan, and the guards. And viewers can't blame an inability to access media information for Tracy and Donavan's manipulation. Plenty of Jodi's followers were well-educated people outside the jail system with 24-hour media coverage about her and her crime. Watch this movie to learn how to protect yourself from psychopaths.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

She reveals they are on a financial cliff, but he isn't concerned.<br/><br/>Nancy goes to their friend, insurance actuary Joe, to get a loan against their life insurance policy. Joe advises Nancy that this is a bad idea that could do more harm financially than help. He offers Nancy a job in sales, but she says no.

Nancy hugs her husband and dreams of having a new house, a published book, and a trip to Portugal. When Daniel's second job doesn't fill the deficit, Nancy takes the sales job and starts to plot a way to get out without Daniel.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Nancy is full of envy, greed, and pride. She envies her brother, Mark, who makes a good living as a lawyer, but he has cancer. Nancy spends to appear wealthy and never wants to work to make more money.

  "review":"Elena comes home to smell her mother's delicious food cooking on the stove. Elena wants to know why her mother, Teresa, is packing, but Teresa wants a moment to gather her thoughts before she explains. She tells Elena that she is leaving early morning to see Elena's grandmother, Sophia, in the hospital. For years, Teresa made Elena believe that Sophie had died. Teresa explains she lied to Elena to protect Elena from her past.<br/><br/>Elena watches Teresa leave in the morning and talk to a man, Grant. A few days later, Grant knocks on Elena's door with heartbreaking news. Someone murdered Teresa, and Elena's life is in danger. Teresa was in witness protection before Elena's birth because Teresa testified against Elena's father, Lorenzo, and his violent associates. Grant promised Teresa he would keep Elena safe. So he wants to give Elena a new identity and immediately move her. Elena refuses because she wants to find the person who killed her mom. She pushes Grant out of the door and looks through her mom's things. She finds the name of Teresa's old friend, Jackie, and calls her. Jackie invites Elena to visit anytime. This invitation gives Elena an idea. She can go to Teresa's old hometown and investigate Teresa's murder. Elena will uncover the evil within Teresa's dark past.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie feels typical as Elena makes one horrible mistake after another. Each time, Grant has to rescue her. When the plot focuses on the mystery, this film improves. The motive for Teresa's death, however, is common. If you get past the first hour, the enigma will hold you. But the conclusion falls flat.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Dennis wants Audrey to go to Hope Cove and shadow Morgan to find out what makes him and the newspaper, The Hope Cove Beacon, so unique. He will give Audrey a highly-coveted promotion with a raise if she writes a good article.<br/><br/>Audrey walks into an editorial meeting, and Morgan, the soon-to-be editor-in-chief, mistakes Audrey for a delivery person. Morgan's father, soon-to-be-retired editor-in-chief Clifton, corrects his son and invites Audrey to sit and attend the meeting. She listens to the stories, and one catches her attention. Greg has a story about Ask Aunt Hope. The paper has an anonymous advice columnist who answers the town's letters from an old fashion drop mailbox. No one knows who Aunt Hope is, but she sends her responses in time to make the paper. Audrey wants to work on the article while shadowing Morgan.<br/><br/>Clifton takes a phone call from Mitchell. Mitchell wants to absorb the Beacon into their media conglomerate. Morgan tells Clifton not to sell without adding some contingencies to the contract. Clifton mulls over the idea and asks Mitchell to give him some more time. However, no one knows that Michelle and Audrey's boss, Dennis, is the same person. He sent Audrey to spy on the paper without informing her. As Morgan and Audrey work together and learn from each other, will Dennis Mitchell's devious plan to take over destroy their budding romance?<br/><br/>This movie is slow, and the leads have zero chemistry. Viewers watch to see who is behind Ask Aunt Hope, and it's the only reason to keep watching. The story of Aunt Hope is loving and heart-warming, but everything else in this movie drags.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

So Nick and Tracy spin a globe and, after several tries, land on Rhodes, Greece.<br/><br/>They arrived in Rhodes a day late because their plane got delayed. So they beg the concierge, Elizabeth, for any available rooms tonight. Pen overhears their conversation and calls Tessa, who runs Casita Casita Lindos with her brother Xander and has a vacancy. Nick and Tracy take an unforgettable ride to the hotel and go to their room. Tracy unpacks the veil to let it air out. Tracy sits outside to read The Great Gatsby, and Leo offers to draw Tracy a picture. Nick and Tracy meet for a lunch date but can't bare to swallow Xander's food. They feign compliments and leave for the market. They see Leo sneak through a window of a local school after saying goodbye.<br/><br/>Tracy wakes up alone and deduces Nick is in the kitchen fixing Xander's marinara sauce. Tracy is upset because Nick is working on their honeymoon. Tracy calls Emma and Avery to vent, and they lovingly call her a hypocrite because they know she's handled business calls from Stanley. She forgives Nick and tries to be more understanding.<br/><br/>Xander moves Tracy and Nick's things to the honeymoon suite, but Xander forgets the veil. Tracy tells Tess, and they sprint to retrieve it. Before Tess can knock, Colin Dalton comes out with the garment in hand, and they bump into each other. Tracy thankfully gathers the veil and tells everyone about its origin.<br/><br/>Leo gives Tracy a gift, and she repays Leo with new art supplies. Headmaster Papadopoulos sees Leo with the present and assumes he stole them. He confronts Tracy about the gift because it gives Leo false hope about his ability to use art to make a living. Tracy and Nick learn that Leo is an orphan residing at the school. Leo has an idea. Leo follows Emma online and wants her to look at an artifact the school found. If the school gets donations from the artwork, it could help Papadopoulos see the value in art. Tracy promises to try for Leo. While Tracy fulfills her promise, the veil sprinkles its magic on Tess and Colin.<br/><br/>Inspired by There Goes the Bride by Lori Wilde and the 6th movie in The Wedding Veil series, this plot gives another honest view into marriage. Nick and Tracy love their work, but it leaves little time for romance. On their honeymoon, they still can't escape the office but for different reasons. Tracy is the defacto boss, but Nick is losing his passion. And we can never forget the veil's magic because it strikes two couples this time. This storyline gives Tracy's character the most growth and makes viewers misty-eyed.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
