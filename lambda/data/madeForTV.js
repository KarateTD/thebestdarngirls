    "review":"Denise and Ashley are relaunching their app, Pupil, with a new interface in a few days.  With billionaire Peter and his $7 million backing them, they hope to get their sales out of a slump. Denise wants to have a party for the relaunch but doesn't want Ashley in charge. Denise drives home and gets rear-ended by another driver.  Molly, the driver, admits to texting while operating a vehicle, and Denise doesn't get mad because she's guilty of it too.  They exchange cards, and Denise sees Molly works as a party planner. Molly gives Denise a reference and asks Denise to call any time.  Later that night, Denise checks Molly's references and listens to a glowing recommendation.  Denise gives Molly the job.  Denise thinks everything is falling into step for the relaunch, but Molly will rain fire and brimstone on Denise's family, marriage, friends, and job.<br/><br/>No one should be this naive.  Difficult to believe that Denise would believe Molly over Ashley. But that's Lifetime! There are two prominent jumpscares in this movie.  However, the rest of the film will frustrate you as Molly easily weasels her way into Denise's life with one reference.  If you cheer for Molly, this is a movie to watch.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"At Brian and Nicole's wedding, the happy couple gets messages from their friends. Four years later, Brian and Nicole are successful and happy. Before going to work, Nicole goes to her favorite coffee shop and gets the same order.  As she sits and sips, Brandi walks in and sits down.  Brandi works helping animals in Africa and dates a doctor.  They make plans to spend time together and part ways.  The next day, Nicole sees a newscast about a woman who committed suicide, and it's Brandi.  Nicole can't believe Brandi would harm herself when everything was going so well for her.  But Brandi was just the first of many. How many will survive in this bloody need for payback?<br/><br/>If you are a Lifetime fan, it doesn't take much to piece who is behind it all. As you eliminate suspects one by one, the script does a pretty good job and throwing your attention in another direction.  You may even suspect the lead for a while.  But in the end, you are right.  Get your popcorn ready.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Kate video calls with her friend, Emma, before the big day.  Coach Johnson will pick the next cheer captain. Kate believes Emma will win, but Emma worries the new girl, Anna, will get the position. It comes as no surprise when the captain picks Emma.  Anna congratulates Emma, but Kate feels that Anna is fake.  Kate is right.  After the announcement, Anna goes to Coach Johnson and requests to be captain, but the coach says no. Mr. Olsen, the calculus teacher, tells Anna that she is falling behind.  If she doesn't maintain a C+ average, she will lose her spot on the squad.  At a pool party, Anna makes one more desperate attempt to be captain.  She approaches Emma to request they go to the coach and offer being co-captains.  Emma says no and leaves furious and frustrated. Emma walks away to help with the party while Kate sits and talks to Emma's boyfriend, Shane.  Soon, people are screaming because Emma is on the floor and won't wake up.  Emma dies of an overdose, but Kate doesn't believe it. Kate and Shane will investigate what happened to Emma and who is responsible for Emma's death.<br/><br/>Ms. Fox gives us another 'The Wrong' gem with the much-needed tagline at the end.  As Kate uncovers the truth behind Anna's wrongdoings, you know Anna has done worse in the past. As she reveals the truth behind Emma's death, Kate gets hardcore motherly advice. While not original, the actresses and actors make this movie one to watch.  Sit back and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
