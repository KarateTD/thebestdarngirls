    "review":"After stealing another doctor's identity, Dr. Beck is working at a sleep study clinic.  His first patient, Michelle, came to the sleep clinic after her last sleepwalking episode of sexsomnia when viral.  Dr. Beck can't wait to help her.  But his focus shifts when he learns Michelle's niece, Nikki, suffers from sleepwalking.  Unlike her aunt, Nikky is highly suggestible when she sleepwalks.  Dr. Beck wants to get Michelle out of the way so Nikky can fall in love with him.  Then, he will be a peace.<br/><br/>The 4th installment of the series is the craziest today.  It starts to become dizzying after the real world and Dr. Beck's imaginary world blur.  While this movie ended like a lot of other Lifetime movies, Dr. Beck may found his way to a 5th movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Katie has bent the rules since her father died.  She smokes, talks back, and challenges authority.  When she becomes violent with a teacher, she is put on house arrest for a month.  Instead of focusing on her studies, she focuses on the cute boy across the street.  She flirts with him, peeps through his window, and invites him in when no one is home.  Over time, she starts to feel like something is off about John.  With her reputation of lying, can she convince others there is a problem with him?<br/><br/>What if Rear Window met Mean Girls?  This is the movie that answers that question.  You know you should be concerned with Katie safety but she is such an awful, spoiled brat, you never really care.  You have more compassion for John being stuck in a scam than Katie.  So, watch this as background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hailey wants to pitch an idea to the biggest toy company to get a leg up for a promotion.  But her boss, Shana doesn't believe she embodies Christmas.  So, she sends Hailey to camp.  If Hailey gets the certificate of completion, Shana will choose between her and Tom's pitch.  At Christmas Camp, Hailey gets more than a certificate.  She gets love, a new business idea, and the perfect pitch.<br/><br/>The first movie in the Christmas in July run just falls flat.  Every storyline, even the surprise at the end, are all predictable.  Christmas camp is a novel idea but not for a movie.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Emmy, a precocious 8-year-old girl, wants a puppy.  Her father, Ryan, always says no.  When Emmy meets Hailey, owner of Happy Puppy Party, she puts a plan into motion.  Not just for a puppy but for a date for her dad.  But Emmy doesn't know these two have a grown-up problem.  Hailey is trying to get the new development project shut down in order to create a new dog park.  Ryan is in charge of the development project.  Can they put aside their issues to make Emmy's dreams come true?<br/><br/>A cute kid and adorable puppies are the saving grace of this movie.  While it does fall into the Hallmark plot trap, it gives you an almost kiss for tension.  With this being said, it allows the love story to flow at Emmy's pace.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"An aspiring model, Grace, answers an ad for a model match up site.  She leaves her mother and boyfriend, Matt, behind to go to Miami and meet Hunter Kelly.  She is picked up by his assistant, Nicole, and given vague details about the models' apartment.  After a few test photos and missed opportunities to leave, Grace is trapped in Hunter's guest house.  She must perform for his live-webcam or he will kill her mother.  It will take a kiss and 3 little words to save Grace from Hunter.<br/><br/>So, the set up is annoying.  Grace can tell this is too good to be true but she still goes to Miami.  The plot is strong.  Grace can sense Hunter and Nicole's weaknesses and uses them to attempt several escapes.  Your heart will beat faster each time she tries.  The conclusion is predictable and average. You can see how the movie will end a mile away.  But you are too committed to change the channel.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
