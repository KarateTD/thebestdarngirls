    "mtitle":"Surviving the Sleepover",
    "review":"Hannah and her mother, Jessica, reside in a hotel while contractors finish their home. Jessica tells Hannah to worry more about making friends than their living arrangements.<br/><br/>Hannah vlogs about coping with her father's passing and moving to another town. As she films while walking to school, Melissa honks her horn, causing Hannah to drop her phone. Abbie and Charlotte, recognized the new girl but didn't know she resided in a hotel.<br/><br/>Melissa arrives at school and sees her stepbrother, Cameron, watching Hannah's vlog. She warns Cameron to stay away from Hannah. Cameron pulls Melissa away from her friends and rages that they had a one-time fling.<br/><br/>Hannah and Abbie talk during Spanish class and become friends. Abbie encourages Hannah to ask Cameron to date but warns that Melissa is protective over him. Hannah takes Abbie's advice, and Cameron accepts. Before they can cement their plans, Melissa invites Hannah to a girls-only sleepover.<br/><br/>During the sleepover, Melissa tries to humiliate Hannah. They play the game 'Never Have I Ever.' Melissa's card asks if the reader ever had a crush on their stepbrother. Melissa flies into a rage and blames Hannah. Hannah tries to pass Melissa, but Melissa grabs a knife. Abbie, attempting to help Hannah leave, gets stabbed by Melissa. Melissa panics and guides Hannah and Abbie to a room so Abbie can rest and wait for an ambulance. However, Melissa locks them inside. She doesn't plan on Abbie or Hannah surviving the sleepover.<br/><br/>This movie is Mean Girls turned deadly. Melissa's obsession with Cameron is narcissistic and delusional. Charlotte is the consummate beta follower, but Abbie openly second-guesses Melissa. As Melissa's crazy slowly ramps up, her cunning nature evolves. However, the final 5 minutes destroy her character development. She caused so much havoc and didn't suffer any consequences. Instead of punishment, viewers get a group therapy session. It leaves the audience with a bad taste in their mouths.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Killing for Extra Credit",
    "review":"Marybeth receives more disparaging text from classmates before the start of her senior year. Her best friend, Sophie, tells Marybeth to ignore the bullies and focus on this year. Last year, intimate photos Marybeth sent her boyfriend, Josh, were leaked to the school. Marybeth's friend, Ray, meets Marybeth and Sophie at school, and they walk in together but stop when they see Marybeth's presidential rival, Toby. Toby exposed Marybeth's photos in the school newspaper and now gloats about taking her job and being president.<br/><br/>Josh attempts to talk to Marybeth during class, but she refuses. She believes Josh gave her photos to Toby, but Josh vehemently denies it. The school gets a text message from someone calling themselves 'Extra Credit.' And this unanimous person exposes secrets throughout the day. Marybeth asks Sophie and Ray to help her expose 'Extra Credit.'<br/><br/>Marybeth gets the shock of her life one day. 'Extra Credit' tells the school that Sophie released Marybeth's pictures. Marybeth confronts Sophie, and Sophie cries and begs to explain. Marybeth refuses to listen. Later, Sophie's father can't find Sophie. Marybeth runs to their private meeting spot and finds Sophie dead. The police rule it a suicide, but Marybeth doesn't believe it. She wants to prove someone killed Sophie and that it was 'Extra Credit.' Can Marybeth uncover the culprit without losing her life?<br/><br/>This movie feels like a continuation of Friday Night Sext Scandal and has many moving parts. The plot slows as Marybeth and Ray look through Marybeth's life to uncover the events leading to her demise. However, the conclusion - well, the first - speeds up the movie ten times. But hang on because there is a fun twist. This movie is perfect for the Spring Break crowd, but adults may want more.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
