    "mtitle": "A Husband to Die For: The Lisa Aguilar Story",
    "review": "Lisa sneaks to a private area with her husband, Darren, so they can have time alone while he's at work. Darren notices that Lisa is eating more than usual. Lisa informs him that she's 1 month pregnant with their first child. Several months later, Darren sees a beautiful co-worker, Michelle. While Lisa visits her parents, Darren and Michelle's torrid relationship gets physical.<br/><br/>Lisa and Darren learn that their doctor miscalculated the baby's due date. The baby is due in a few weeks. Darren lied to Michelle by saying he and Lisa are in divorce proceedings. And Lisa becomes more wary with each passing day. However, Lisa assumes it's the jitters of a first-time father.<br/><br/>Lisa returns home from grocery shopping and enters her apartment. A masked intruder attacks her and cuts her throat multiple times. She musters the strength to drag herself to the phone and dial 911. The doctor saves Lisa and her unborn son. She wakes with Darren by her side and Detective Goodwin outside her room.<br/><br/>Goodwin questions Lisa about her attacker, her marriage, and her actions on the day of the attack. A few moments later, Lisa hears Darren screaming, and Goodwin escorts him away in handcuffs. The police arrested Darren for Lisa's attempted murder. But she refused to believe the love of her life would harm her. Lisa demands justice for Darren, but is she willing to die for it?<br/><br/>Lifetimers, please give Lisa some grace during this film. Remember, this is the early 90s. So, words like gaslighting, red flags, and narcissist aren't common phrases pushed by a social media algorithm. The writers give viewers a glimpse at the main characters' backgrounds. Darren's parents expect nothing less than greatness and impose their will and dreams on him. Lisa's family is accommodating and understanding. The attack is brutal and could be a trigger for some viewers. However, this level of violence is necessary to understand the hell Lisa and her unborn child survived. This film proves that you may never know the person you lie next to.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Sadie has no choice but to move in with Grant and Evelyn. Sadie believes she is doing the best for her family. Unfortunately, she has entered a house of horrors.

    "mtitle": "Sugar Mama",
    "review": "Tech Investor Veronica is a guest lecturer at a college campus. During her presentation, student Mike enters late. Afterward, Mike approaches Veronica with an apology. She walks towards the parking lot and sees an older woman with two younger men. The woman is a sugar mama and uses an app to find her sugar babies. She shows Veronica the app, and Veronica asks her assistant, Andrew, to research it for her company. Veronica scrolls through the profiles and finds Mike. She requests a meeting.<br/><br/>Mike relaxes at home when his sugar mama, Beverly, knocks on the door. She's ending their arrangement early because he couldn't commit more time to her. Mike's girlfriend, Gia, slowly enters the room. They still need $8,000 to pay their tuition. He will work harder to find a replacement for Beverly. Mike opens the app and sees that Veronica selected him. He assures Gia that this will secure their future and accepts the request.<br/><br/>Mike and Veronica meet at dinner. She will pay him if he attends meetings, luncheons, galas, and other functions. She wants him to do research on the sugar baby app and introduce his app to investors. He will work for $10,000 a month for the next three months. They agree to the arrangement. Mike runs and tells Gia that he found a solution to their money woes. He has no idea that he is in danger. Veronica is an unhinged woman with a horrific plan for Mike and everyone in his orbit.<br/><br/>Nothing can prepare you for this film. There aren't enough words to describe Veronica's unsettling behavior. The writers did a stupendous job ensuring that everyone looks suspicious. However, Veronica's intentions are ghastly and 100% unpredictable, but the breadcrumbs are there for viewers to follow. It's been a while since Lifetime had a story this captivating without it being a 'true crime.' This Tubi masterpiece on Lifetime will make the audience beg for a part 2 and therapy.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Groomsmen First Look",
    "review": "Doctor Pete fusses with his bow tie while reviewing his patient's status on the phone. He hangs up, turns, and bumps into Doctor Chelsea, dropping their identical phones. He picks them up and double-checks that he returned hers. Chelsea breathes a sigh of relief because she is the maid of honor, and the phone has her speech on it. She confesses her fear of public speaking, and Pete tells her to imagine everyone in their pajamas. She fixes his bow tie as he explains that the bride's brother, Danny, is his best friend. They leave for the reception, and Pete sits with Jackson. He watches Chelsea slip into the main table. She stands to speak, and her phone dies. She quietly panics and looks toward Pete. He mouths 'pajamas,' and it calms her.<br/><br/>Danny and Jackson notice that Pete is missing. They realized he snuck away to spend time with Chelsea. While eating pretzels, Chelsea reveals that she is in town for the wedding. She works in a European clinic and will leave in the morning. Pete's sad by her admission, and updates his friends. They remind him that long-distance relationships are possible.<br/><br/>Pete runs to Chelsea's hotel in the morning, but the concierge points to Chelsea, getting in the cab. He sprints down the street screaming Chelsea's name. Then, Chelsea steps beside Danny and Jackson and asks why Pete is yelling and running away. Panting, Pete returns to the hotel and asks Chelsea for a long-distance romance. Chelsea admits that this type of relationship is new for her, but she's willing to give it a chance. This leap of faith will lead to a tree beating, crazy parents, and a fashion show. But will it end in heartbreak?<br/><br/>Hallmark has another franchise smash hit in its lineup. This first film of a three-part series is funny, romantic, and heartwarming. Yes, the script focuses on Chelsea and Pete's romance. However, it shines a light on the friendship between the three men. This movie is interesting because it's told through the narration of a runaway bride, hiding in a bar. This first installment is a spectacular way to hook the fans and make them yearn for more. If you are a fan of the Three Wise Men Series, then buckle up for another Hallmark classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Girl Who Vanished",
    "review": "Kate catches her daughter, Lily, sneaking into the house after spending the evening with Dean. Kate grounds Lily, and Lily is angry. She believes Kate is taking out her fears on her. Ten years ago, someone abducted Kate's other daughter, Emily. The police never found the young girl.<br/><br/>After school, Kate informs Lily that it's her father's weekend. And she told Matt about the punishment and warned him to stick to it. When the phone rings, Kate leaves to answer it, and Lily hears the sound of glass shattering. The police found Emily alive. Officer Bowen offers to give a DNA test, but Kate wants to wait until they get her home.<br/><br/>Emily settles into her home and delights that things look the same, except for Lily's room. As everyone rejoices about Emily's return, Lily sees the kinks in her armor. She gets details about the abduction wrong, develops new allergies, and becomes agitated when people ask probing questions. Lily starts to wonder if Emily is her sister. She warns Kate, but Kate tells Lily to let it go. However, Lily won't allow anyone to stop her from learning the truth, not even a killer.<br/><br/>This film has a classic Lifetime setup. A kidnapped victim returns home, and the elated family refuses a DNA test. So fans know this 'survivor' is hiding something sinister. In Lifetime fashion, the secondary characters drop like flies. The writers pulled you into the story by making everyone act strangely, and the backing track amps up these feelings with mysterious and cryptic music. The twist and several hits to the face are compelling. While the build is standard, the twist is unsurprisingly fun. If fans can get past adults playing teens, you will enjoy this 2-hour reality break.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Mystery Island: House Rules",
"review": "Janey strategizes new game ideas with Emilia and Jason. She informs them that real murders on Mystery Island have aided their popularity. Their investor, Carlos, wants to expand to the mountains to have a snowy location for winter vacation fans. They will call it Mystery Mountain. Carlos hired hotel heir, Dex, to be the Janey of Mystery Mountain. Dex chose police Detective Regan to handle Jason-ish work, and Dr. Stanley to be Emilia. Inga will cover Bennett's duties with her head of security, Khalif. Dex wants to showcase his team's skills by presenting the Mystery Island team with a puzzle they created.<br/><br/>Emilia and Jason enjoy the quality time away from work. She recently made an important decision to work on the island full-time. Jason was a factor in that decision. Finally, they profess their feelings for each other.<br/><br/>The Mystery Island team arrives at the dock to board Dex's Miss Teri boat to the island. Bennett's new assistant, Thomas, joins the team. They travel to Mystery Island, and the Mystery Mountain team greets them like guests.<br/><br/>Dex greets his guests and introduces them to his changes. Mystery Mountain will incorporate the weather with snow machines and thunder. They created a private Bluetooth network. They distribute phones to the guests. When the phones are activated, it will signal the beginning of the game. Then, their phones get the first clue. The team follows the clues to the game room, which leads them to a hologram of the Mystery Island inspiration, Evelyn. She provides three more clues. The guests follow the clue and look through the books.<br/><br/>As the team searches through the books, a dart shoots Regan in the neck. Regan falls on the floor and stops breathing. Then, they hear a bang and follow the sound. Someone detonated a small explosive near the Bluetooth box. They return to the room to examine Regan's body, but it's gone. This game is real. They have a murder, a missing dead body, and a room full of suspects. Can Mystery Island solve the crime, or is a member of their team the culprit?<br/><br/>This mystery puts the drivers in the passenger seat and acknowledges the first in the franchise while introducing us to new characters. It's fun to watch the Mystery Island team come face-to-face with their counterparts. They become fast friends but turn into enemies as bodies drop. Viewers will feel something's off about this installment. However, you won't understand until the big reveal. While this installment doesn't provide the hard-hitting story, it introduces an overarching plot and confirms Hallmarkies' favorite romance. It's doubtful the Mystery Mountain will become a spinoff, but the characters may come back for other installments.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Murder at the Hotel",
"review": "A snowstorm leaves several passengers stranded at the airport. The ticket agent, Jan, handles a line as customers complain. Evan doesn't mince words because he values his time more than anyone else. District Attorney Megan puts him in his place and sticks up for Jan. She is traveling with her husband, Jeff, and daughter, Lisa. Megan walks toward her family and bumps into her college ex-boyfriend, Brad. As they talk, Nicole sits with Jeff.

Then, Jan informs the remaining passengers that they will receive a hotel voucher and get booked on the next flight in the morning.<br/><br/>They arrive at the hotel. Brad invites Megan and her family to dinner at the hotel restaurant. They accept. Lisa leaves early to distance herself from her parents. She makes impromptu plans to jump in the hot tub with Landon. After catching Jan with her boyfriend, hotel manager Rick, Megan looks for her family but can't find them. When she stumbles across a dead body, she fears a killer is after her. Can Megan find the murderer in the hotel?<br/><br/>This movie puts semi-strangers in an unfamiliar territory. The plot will grab your attention because every character has a secret or suspicious behavior. And the writers added a final twist that leaves a shock on everyone's face. While the mystery is compelling, the graphics and bad edits during fight scenes are distracting. This film is a perfect way to kill 2 hours without being bored.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Zack sighs and agrees as Danny's friends, Pete and Jackson, enter. They laugh after Zack leaves because they know Danny has feelings for Zack, but won't tell him.<br/><br/>At Hannah's wedding, Zack and Danny notice Pete dancing with his new friend, Chelsea, and chuckle. Zack informs Danny that he can't be his standby plus one because he's dating a lawyer, Nolan. Months later, Zack and Danny attend Pete and Chelsea's wedding. However, Danny sees that Zack is alone. Zack wanted to get married, and Nolan said no. Danny promises to be by Zack's side.<br/><br/>Later, Zack is all smiles because Nolan called and changed his mind. Zack asks Danny to be the best man at his and Nolan's wedding. Danny forces a grin and agrees, but Pete and Jackson warn Danny that it's a bad idea. And to make things worse, Zack wants to get married in a location that holds significant meaning for his and Danny's friendship: Greece. Pete and Jackson will offer guidance to stop Danny from making a mistake. Will Danny get his second chance at love, or will he watch Zack marry Nolan?<br/><br/>The Groomsmen are back for a second installment. Like the first, this film's narrator is a runaway bride hiding in a bar. The writer beautifully wove this story into the first. It's happening alongside Chelsea and Pete's love story, while hinting at the 3rd movie. The plot utilizes Greece as another character with stunning views, colorful people, and delicious food. This movie is a terrific addition to the franchise and hints at more to come after the 3rd.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
