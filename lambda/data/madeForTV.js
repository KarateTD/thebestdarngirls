    "review":"Chef Ava finishes a successful night and rides home. She gets a call saying her Aunt Judy sustained an injury. Ava catches the first flight to South Carolina. She calls a car service to pick her up from the airport to go to Judy's hospital bedside. The driver, Luke, is chatty. Before Ava enters the hospital, Luke shares his contact information with her. Now, she can call him whenever she needs help.<br/><br/>Judy complains to the hospital staff about black-eyed peas. Then, Ava tells Judy she is at a crossroads. Her doctor diagnosed her with rheumatoid arthritis, and Ava hasn't made progress with her cookbook. As Judy guides Ava, Ava gets a phone call. Ava lost her job. Luke enters with a bowl of black-eyed peas and he offers Ava a taste. Luke admits he wants to get his contractor license or go to cooking school. Ava is impressed with the dish but suggests he use pork stock instead of chicken.<br/><br/>Later, Ava calls Luke to install safety railings in Judy's home. Ava quietly checks out Luke when her phone rings. Her ex-boyfriend calls because he wants to propose to his new girlfriend at Ava's old job. Ava hangs up the phone to find Luke standing behind her. Ava feels pathetic. Luke doesn't want to leave Ava alone. So he gives her two options: spend time with him at a restaurant or watch trash TV together in Judy's home. Ava agrees to go out but refuses to call it a date. Ava believes Luke is too young, but he is ready to prove her wrong. Can Luke convince Ava that age doesn't matter?<br/><br/>Take a breath Lifetimers. This movie isn't the craziness and mayhem you expect. It's a story about Ava learning to love and allowing someone to love her. Their love story won't end as expected, but it shows Ava's maturity. This film is like a book. It takes time for the plot to captivate you, but it allows you to fall in love slowly. If you need a break from craziness, this movie is for you, but it's not for younger viewers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of stars.",

    "review":"Jackson's family greets him with a surprise party. His uncle, Coach Pete, and mother, Maria, sing Happy Birthday. Later, Pete tells Jackson he is on the shortlist for the San Francisco University Soccker Scholarship. Jackson asks if his friend, teammate Tyler, made it. Sadly, he did not.<br/><br/>Tyler and Jackson talk after practice. Tyler teases Jackson and gets a text from his job. Tyler shows off his gold chain as the fruits of his labor. Jackson drops Tyler off at the Blue Fox Social Club and notices everyone wearing a fox mask. Tyler asks Jackson to consider working at the Blue Fox, but Jackson rejects him and drives to the diner.<br/><br/>Maria owns and operates a local restaurant, but local land development hurts her business. Pete comes inside after hours, and Maria shows him a letter she got from the development company. They want to buy her café for a lot of money. Unbeknownst to Maria and Pete, Jackson overhears their conversation. Jackson and Maria converse after Pete leaves. Jackson offers to help more, but Maria refuses.<br/><br/>Jackson chooses to work at the Blue Fox Social Club and asks Tyler for help. Tyler invites Jackson to the club, and Myles welcomes Jackson. Myles informs Jackson that the mask helps patrons lower their inhibitions. Jackson's job is to entertain, but Jackson can dictate how far he wants to go. But the more Jackson does, the more customers will pay. Tyler comes to practice the next day and hands Jackson an envelope full of money. Jackson gives the cash to Maria. Jackson believes that he uncovered the answer to Maria's money woes. However, his service job will lead him to a life of guns, sex work, and murder.<br/><br/>One secret in this plot is unchallenging for Lifetimers to discover. But the second will make your head spin with one word. That unexpected twist saves the movie. Viewers will question Maria's actions, but you will learn she is parenting from guilt. She is deceiving Jackson, as he is her. There are a few unnecessary scenes, and the final fight is laughable. However, this movie is a decent way to spend two hours.<br/><br/>3 out of stars.",

    "review":"Carly will be alone this summer because her best friend, Jenna, will spend the summer with family. On the first day of summer break, Carly purchases a coffee from a café and requests free water to take her heart medication. She turns and bumps into Abram, dropping her coffee on the floor. Carly and Abram dated over the summer. Abram tells Carly he is Amish, and they continue to spend time together until Carly breaks up with him.<br/><br/>Jenna returns and is happy to start college with Carly. Carly attends classes and shockingly sees Abram. He enrolled after getting a high school diploma through the mail and leaving his community. Carly and Abram start dating again.

Carly pulls out her phone to call 911, but Abram hits her. Abram kidnapped Carly, stole her phone, and texted her family and friends. And he never plans to let her go. Can Carly escape a madman?<br/><br/>Carly, you picked the wrong Amish boyfriend. Viewers will give Jenna a suspicious look at the movie's start because she spends every moment weaving herself into Carly's life. However, her warnings are correct but fall on blocked ears. Carly spends more time defending her relationship than evaluating it. This film has the wild plot Lifetimers crave. It doesn't become shocking in the last 15 minutes. It starts deranged and ramps up. Your flesh will crawl as you laugh and yell at the TV. This movie is what viewers beg for.<br/><br/>5 out of stars.",

    "mtitle": "Miss Cleo: Her Rise and Fall",
    "review": "Youree runs lines before her sold-out performance at a community center. She leaves rehearsals early after a script disagreement, and the director, Carl, runs after her. Everyone knows she got a grant, and they want her to pay them now. Youree won't budge and drives home. She leaves with her daughters and the theater's grant money.<br/><br/>Youree arrives in Fort Lauderdale with her daughters, Crystal and Lena. She looks at the newspaper for jobs and finds one for the Psychic Readers Network. The manager hands Youree a document and tells her to sign it. It states that Youree is a psychic. She signs and gets on the phone. Youree goes off script, fakes a Jamaican accent, brings tarot cards to work, and calls herself Miss Cleo. She becomes Fort Lauderdale's #1 phone psychic.<br/><br/>Peter enters a frustrated Steven's office. Their telecommunications company dwindles, and Steven needs help. Peter gives Steven the Fort Lauderdale numbers and delightfully says they are from one operator. Peter tells Steven to arrange a meeting with Youree.<br/><br/>Peter and Steven meet with Youree. They ask her to become a spokesperson for the network. Steven likes her style but wants to change Miss Cleo's backstory. Youree agrees to become the face of the network after dinner. For Youree, this is another acting job. However, she's joined a billion-dollar scam.<br/><br/>First, The Lady of Rage pulls an award-winning performance in this movie. Next, the writers ensured they didn't make Miss Cleo a hero. Viewers should listen closely during Youree's first meeting with Peter and Steven. Steven uses many words to say they are collecting and selling customer information without their knowledge. During her fall, Youree's status makes her the face of the scam, and falsely, the mastermind. Some viewers may consider this unfair, while others say it's karma. This conclusion leaves that decision to the audience. So, watch and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
