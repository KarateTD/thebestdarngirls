    "review":"Author Frida moves to Sweet Meadow with her daughter, Jade.  Frida meets Louise, the volleyball coach, and they make a connection over their daughters.  Louise's daughter, Mayson, plays on the team.  After Jade makes the team, she invites Teanna, a teammate, to Surprise Saturday.<br/><br/>Jade asks Frida for a new dress for Mayson's birthday party.  Although Frida promised to give it some thought, now she snaps at the barrage of requests and says no.  She leaves the party to go on a walk and sees an unfamiliar face, Rick.  Rick tries to flirt, but Jade shoots him down and goes back inside.  Jade notices everyone is looking at their phone, and she gets a notification.  Someone killed Teanna.  Rick gives Jade a ride home, but she still won't go out on a date with him.<br/><br/>Frida fears a killer is on the loose, so she won't let Jade leave the house for anything other than school and volleyball.  Jade gets on the computer and discovers Frida's secret.  Frida is heavily in debt, and their home is in foreclosure.  Frida confessed to Louise but decided not to tell Jade to protect her.  Jade goes to her bedroom, tries to understand her mother's financial hardships, looks out her window, and sees Rick doing his best 'Say Anything' boombox rendition.  They have a nice dinner out and run out before the bill comes.  She tells Rick about Frida's money troubles, and Rick has a way to help.  Rick wants Jade to go to rich people's parties at their home.  Once inside, she will case the house for valuables and make copies of their keys.  When Jade protests, he explains that the victims will write it off on their insurance and get paid.  So, no one will be a victim.  He vows to split the proceeds with Jade, and she accepts.  But there will be victims, including Jade.<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn to give you complex backstories and necessary character arches.  Expert Lifetimers can spot the person behind the curtain after a few plot setups.  But discovering who the puppet master is is only half the twist.  The reason this plan started is more complex and intriguing.  Of course, you have the bratty teen.  So parents, prepare yourself to become enraged by Jade's behavior.  This film is easy to watch, but prepare yourself for a slow start-up and a rapid conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After living in the high-paced New York City, Sarah left to start a farm with her son, Henry, and father, Calvin.  Henry goes to the barn and finds a homeless man inside.  The man tells Sarah that he is not a robber but a man of honor.  The man says his name is Richard the second, but everyone calls him Rip.  Sarah gives Rip stew and calls Deputy Ted to take Rip back to the station.<br/><br/>Sarah remembers her neighbors had a son in the military.  She worries that Rip could be their son with amnesia or PTSD.  Since Sarah won't press charges, Ted must let Rip go.  Rip checks himself out of the hospital and goes back to the barn.  He wants to pay Sarah back for the stew by doing labor on her farm.<br/><br/>Sarah allows Rip to live in the farmhand's house until they learn Rip's identity.  When Rip eyes the home, he says it's his from 1789.  He remembers his name is Rip Van Winkle Jr., after his less honorable father.  Calvin remembers the story and grabs The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon.  Overwhelmed with all the changes, Rip wants to get back to his time.  But there is something he wants more: Sarah.<br/><br/>This retelling of the famous story about the start of US democracy for the H.M.M. audience is charming and humorous.  Sarah admits democracy isn't perfect, but America is trying its best.  Rip confesses that the founding fathers left something out of their original plans for the country. This movie is an easy watch but not the mystery H.M.M. fans expect.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ava quit the swim team after her father's death and joined track.  But balancing athletics and education is too much, so she asks her brother, Ryan, for some of his dexamphetamine.  It's a medication for people with ADHD. The coach, Caroline, praises Ava at practice, and Caroline's daughter, Madison, ignites with jealousy.  Madison takes out her frustrations on Ava and Ava's friend, Cassie.<br/><br/>Ava sits on the bleachers and watches the field as Madison walks toward her.  Madison asks Ava for help with homework to stay on the track team, and Ava begrudgingly accepts.  Later, Madison asked Ava if she could have a pill she saw Ava take earlier.  Ava says yes and gives it to Madison.  Soon, Madison and her friends, Xavier and Wesley, ask Ava for more every day.  When Ava runs out, they tell her to get it from a friend for $20 a pill.  So Ava calls Cassie.  When the girls exchange pills for money, Madison secretly films it.Ava's addiction becomes exponentially worse, and Ryan keeps her secret from their mother, Leslie.  Madison wants Ava to come to a party with Xavier and Wesley.  When Ava arrives, Madison demands more pills.  When Ava says no, Madison shows Ava the video.  Cassie comes to the party with the medication, and the teens start to snort it.<br/><br/>Leslie gets a call from the police stating that Ava was in an accident.  Leslie rushes to the hospital to discover that the young girl isn't Ava, but she has Ava's phone.  Leslie begins to panic because Ava is missing, and an unknown girl with Ava's phone clings to life.  Leslie makes it her mission to find Ava, bring Ava home, and make the people responsible pay.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Alpha Dogs, this movie proves that young people compound their problems when making stupid mistakes.  This film quietly covers the pack mentality.  Wesley and Xavier follow Madison's lead no matter how far her depth of depravity falls.  This movie can be uncomfortable to watch for adults without yelling at the TV.  But remember, they are scared kids with a self-serving moral compass.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
