    "review": "For season 2 of her podcast, Alex decides to head back to her hometown to solve the mystery of Gina DeSalvo.  Gina DeSalvo was last seen leaving her job after getting her tips.

This mystery gives you a rare look into a sleuth's mind while she is figuring out the crime.  With the podcast, you feel more like a friend than a fly on the wall.  Hopefully Hallmark will extend this movie series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
