    "mtitle": "Taken at a Truck Stop: A Black Girl Missing Movie",
    "review": "Kai turns over the keys to her father's old rig one last time. She will retire today and spend time with her niece, Latoya, also known as Toy, on a drive to the West Coast. Toy shared her autism prognosis online and met some backlash. Kai tells Toy to turn off social media and focus on the world around her. Then, she notices Toy's new jewelry. Toy explains that a male friend bought it for her.<br/><br/>Kai meets with her sister, Madison, and beams about retirement. However, Madison secured a job that could potentially lead to a large contract. She begs Kai to take the job, but it will derail her trip with Toy. Kai accepts the drive and tells Toy. Toy is visibly upset but uses her coping mechanisms to relax. Toy counters and asks to join Kai on her job. They can drive to Dallas and spend time together. Kai agrees, and Toy convinces Madison to let her go.<br/><br/>After a few days on the road, Toy leaves the cab to get food at a truck stop while Kai sleeps. A man named Eric approaches Toy. He's her online, gifting friend. He gives her another present, but Toy doesn't respond the way he expects. Toy tries to run, but he grabs her and stuffs her in the trunk of his car. Kai calls the police and Madison. Kai fears that the police aren't taking it seriously because they want to label Toy a runaway. Kai will find the community she thought overlooked her to bring Toy home.<br/><br/>This film is a combination of several actual stories, but it falls short of others in this category. The plot focuses more on the failed relationship between Kai and Madison. Toy becomes an afterthought to their bickering and family issues. Also, the writers focused on the trucker community rejecting Kai. By the conclusion, it feels like Kai kept them at arm's length. This movie is not the best of the series, but it's a decent way to kill two hours.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Dancing With a Murderer",
    "review": "Aspiring fashion designer Nora walks around the Legacy Masquerade Gala until she bumps into an old friend, Liz. Naomi interrupts Liz with exciting news. She nominated Nora for the most coveted award at the gala. Nora looks around the room and sees her ex-boyfriend, Daniel, attending the bar. She walks over to the nominees' table to check out her competition. Paul introduces himself. He makes sly comments because his daughter, Angela, is on the list. After Paul leaves, Dom walks over and asks Nora to dance. Nora says no at first, but Dom won't let her fears stop him. As they dance the night away, Angela enters with a stab wound. She falls to the floor, and attendees call the police. Nora gets a text that she was supposed to be the victim. She rushes home as Angela dies.<br/><br/>One year later, Nora returns. To her surprise, Liz is throwing the gala, but in Angela's honor. Dom cuts off their conversation and gives Nora his business card. He hopes to meet with her later. Nora returns to her mother's home and sees Daniel there. He explains that he helps when he can, especially after Margaret had an uncomfortable encounter with Paul after Angela's death. Nora looks through the mail and finds another threat. The killer still wants her dead and won't stop until they get it right.<br/><br/>This whodunit film isn't much of a mystery. Off-hand comments and side glances give the killer away. The motive is predictable, too. The editing, acting, and costumes are perfect, but they can't make up for the dull script. Once you hear the killer's underhanded remarks, your attention will fade into other activities until the monologue. This movie is perfect for holiday background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Prep School Disappearance",
    "review": "Elise draws in the corner when her ex-boyfriend, Joey, approaches. Joey cheated on Elise with her former best friend, Kaylee. Now, Kaylee and Joey are Romeo and Juliet in the school play. She demands space and leaves.<br/><br/>Donovan enters Lilly's classroom. She is the art teacher at the prep school and his sister-in-law. When her sister, Helen, died, Lilly's drinking got out of control. She's been clean for 6 months and works with her sober coach, Brian, daily. He wants her to stay clean and focus on her job.<br/><br/>Lilly rests at home when she gets a knock on her door. Her niece, Elise, barges in with tears streaming down her face and a bruised wrist. Elise plans to run away, but wants to say goodbye to Lilly first. Lilly begs Elise to stay the night and think things through. Elise will, but only if Lilly gives her the truth about her mom. Lilly tells Elise that Helen got pregnant at 17 and the school forced her to leave. Helen had the baby, but the child did not survive. She upholds her end of the deal and spends the night.<br/><br/>Lilly gave in to temptation after missing meetings and ignoring Brian's calls. She finished a bottle of vodka and slept on the kitchen floor. She walks into the living room, but Elise is not there. Later, Donovan discovers that Elise is missing, and he blames Lilly. She believes that if she were sober, Elise would be here. Lilly will sacrifice everything to get her niece back. Will she succeed?<br/><br/>This film has a crazy and fun villain with a predictable motive. The main characters make stereotypical mistakes, with Brian being the dumbest of all. The investigation was sloppy, forced, and accidental. Nothing about the plot felt organic. It was all happenstance. The actors played their roles to perfection and cared about the project. However, this film starts promising, but ends flat.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Christmas Angel Match",
    "review": "Monica has worked as a Christmas Angel for over 5 centuries. She's used Christmas magic to match couples for generations. Lately, it's been difficult for her because tender hearts, a.k.a humans, won't look up from their devices. She's lost her mojo. Newer angels, like Michael, are surpassing her matches. He uses fun to connect his couples.<br/><br/>Gabriel hosts the annual Christmas Angel awards. For the second year in a row, Michael beat Monica for angel of the year. After the awards, each angel introduces their next match. Monica walks to the podium and announces her next couple is Daisy and Patrick. Michael cuts her off because the higher-ups gave him the same couple. Then, Gabriel gets a phone call. They paired Monica and Michael together to see if the Christmas Match Angels are effective. If they fail, the higher-ups will merge the Christmas Angels with Cupid, and some angels will lose their jobs. Monica will teach Michael the importance of long-term matches, while he will show her how to have fun breaking the rules. But is their more in store for these angels?<br/><br/>This holiday film brings a heartwarming view into the meet-cutes Hallmarkies love this time of the year. It's not just Christmas magic that brings the spark to your favorite movies. It's angels. This script includes lovable grandparents, a flash mob, and karaoke. The writers incorporated charm and humor without being sappy or preachy. This is an entertaining story that makes you believe in Godwink moments.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Five Date Rule",
    "review": "Hattie gave up her dreams of performing on stage and now creates children's songs with life lessons. Hattie meets with her friends, Jill and Arya, to celebrate her birthday. They give her a 3-month subscription to a dating app as her gift. Hattie rolls her eyes and thanks them.<br/><br/>Hattie creates an account and sees the gardener, Henry, whom she met earlier on the app. She skips his profile and matches with three other men. Sadly, those dates go poorly. Hattie accepts Henry for a match. He wants Hattie to give him a chance. She agrees, but only if her friends can vet him. He relents.<br/><br/>During the date, Jill and Arya grill Henry, and he impresses them. Hattie and Henry chose to implement Henry's family's five-date rule. They will date exclusively for five dates. If things go well, they will strive for more. Otherwise, they will move on. Can Henry and Hattie survive five dates, or will their past and opportunities get in the way?<br/><br/>This film found the right place on UP TV. The plot combines relationship sermons with storytelling, although edited poorly. The sound editing is distracting and uncomfortable. Also, the crying scenes are overdone and annoying. This movie's saving graces are the dating montage and song. Save yourself two hours unless you want to watch a Christian-focused film with overacting.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
