    "mtitle":"Suitcase Killer: The Melanie McGuire Story",
    "review":"Melanie works as a waitress while studying for her nurse's exam. Bill walks into the kitchen and takes notice of Melanie. He asks Melanie to join him at the casino. They have a fun night playing blackjack, but Melanie doesn't invite him inside for a nightcap.<br/><br/>Melanie tells her friend, Selene, about the date, and Selene worries because Bill is a flirt and Melanie has a bad temper. But that doesn't stop them from getting married and having two sons. Melanie is a successful nurse at a fertility clinic, and Bill is an engineer. A few years after the birth of their second son, Melanie finds a napkin with a name and number. She never confronts Bill about the note and goes to work. Melanie talks to an egg donor patient and recognizes her name from the napkin. She leaves the room and lets out her frustrations in the bathroom. Doctor Brad Miller sees Melanie, comforts her, and politely flirts. After a few fleeting moments, they give in to their desires and have an affair. While the world thinks Bill and Melanie have a great marriage, three suitcases will prove the world wrong.<br/><br/>This movie has all the sensationalism of Dateline, but it feels incomplete. The film tried to cover too much ground in two hours. With that aside, Melanie is the drowning man. Selene and Bill's ex-wife, Marcy, try to warn Melanie about Bill's ways, but she refuses to listen. If you follow this story, then you will learn something new about Melanie's life with Bill, but nothing new about the murder.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Brittany got her divorce papers in the mail. Thea offers moral support while Brittany signs them. Brittany wants to keep the divorce cordial for her daughter, Emma, to help restore Emma's relationship with her father, Austin. Austin is a cheating alcoholic but wants to do better for his family.<br/><br/>Brittany and Thea go to a spa to relax with a massage. Brittany bumps into a man in the lobby. Doctor Jake makes a joke about offering medical attention, but Brittany says no and laughs. Thea and Brittany's friend, Ava, throw a divorce party for Brittany with a stripper. Ava, a recovering alcoholic, tells Brittany to give the marriage another chance, but Thea tells Ava to stop.<br/><br/>Jake recognizes Brittany from across the room and invites himself to her table at the coffee shop. They talk, laugh, and get to know each other. They make plans to go on a hike later to talk more.<br/><br/>After a great hike, Brittany and Jake run into each other again, but she turns down his invitation. On Brittany's morning run, a person comes out from the woods, attacks, and steals her diamond necklace.<br/><br/>Brittany asks if she can bring Jake to Brittany's soft opening. Ava says yes and decides not to invite Austin to keep the peace, but he shows up saying he got an invitation from Brittany. He sees Brittany and Jake together and becomes angry. In a drunken rage, Austin admits that he had an affair with Thea and then starts a fight. However, Ava blames Austin's relapse on Thea and tries to get Brittany to reconsider. And that's the last thing she will do. Later, someone breaks into Ava's and kills her. When all signs point to Austin, Brittany runs to Jake for understanding. But should she trust him?<br/><br/>This movie is all over the place and does a poor job explaining Jake's fixation on Brittany. The movie has some funny one-liners and beautiful backdrops, but the rest falls flat.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Micah and Dawn spark a conversation at a bar over salad and drinks. She is driving her VW van that Dawn calls Emily along the west coast. Micah tells Dawn that Portland is his destination, and she offers to give him a ride. Dawn hands Micah her phone to take a selfie. It slips out of his fingers and into her drink. Micah promises to buy her an upgrade when they get to Portland.<br/><br/>Dawn turns on a true-crime podcast about the Mechanic Maniac during their drive. The maniac murdered 13 lone travelers in 5 states and is on their way to becoming one of the most prolific serial killers. After driving all day, Micah and Dawn pull over to rest. Dawn asks Micah to find kindling while she showers. Dawn's shower is interrupted when Dawn sees a Bronco in the woods. Micah and Dawn forget about the lurker and go to sleep.<br/><br/>Dawn and Micah sleep through the night, eat, and get back on the road. Soon, they notice the same Bronco from the night before following them. After several high-speed close calls, Dawn believes it's the maniac coming after them. They will need to work with and trust each other to survive this road trip from hell with a maniac on their tail, no phones, and zero civilization.<br/><br/>Bravo to Kurt Yochum for making a compelling horror-thriller film. As Dawn and Micah make classic horror movie mistakes, they prove old clich√©s false. When the plot reveals the stunning twist, it will leave your mouth gaping in amazement and pure, unadulterated delight. Be forewarned, this movie does get a bit bloody, and the killer uses a circular saw. However, the conclusion makes the gore 100% worth it. And the recap helps you spot all the small but blaring clues you missed. Get ready for a wild ride with a potential part 2.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Kendall lives with her mother, Emma, and paints to make money. Her grandmother, Beth, thinks Emma could give Kendall more independence, but Emma disagrees. Kendall has Down syndrome and deals with prejudice and idiotic behavior each day.<br/><br/>Emma goes to the community center to pick up Kendall and sees her talking to a young man outside. Kendall's friends tell Emma that the man is Brad, Kendall's boyfriend. Beth tells Emma that Emma should attend the upcoming banquet and meet Brad.<br/><br/>Emma watches Kendall and Brad adore each other at the banquet. Brad's brother from another mother, Nick, introduces himself. Nick's family protected Brad after his parents died. Brad takes care of himself and has a part-time job at a T-shirt shop. After meeting and learning about Brad, Emma concedes to letting them have a chaperoned date. Emma writes off their romance as a loving friendship. But when Brad proposes, can Emma let go and see Kendall as an adult?<br/><br/>It is impossible to watch this movie without shedding a tear. This movie lets viewers see the lives of Kendall and Emma without passing judgment on either. Kendall and Brad are two people in love, struggling through the complicated emotions with it, but with an extra chromosome. The film points out the discriminatory and hurtful remarks that people with challenges hear daily. Use this movie to open your mind and start a dialog with everyone in your family. FYI, the link in the end credits has a typo. The link should be NDSC center.org.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
