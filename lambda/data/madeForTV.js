    "review": "Dr. Amanda receives a cash reward and a party for becoming the newest partner in the dental practice. Her boss discusses a job for Amanda's husband, Jessie. While the comment was in jest, it struck a nerve with Jessie. He hasn't been able to get a job since his arrest. Amanda calms him and restores his faith in their relationship. Later, Jessie admits he had a lead on a job. He can become a bus driver after taking a training program. Amanda believes he will ace the exam.<br/><br/>Jessie takes his first ride for Blacktop Bus Lines. The passengers are asleep, so he calls Amanda. He promises to come home after he washes the bus and returns it to the depot. He scans the bus for trash and finds a hidden compartment. He opens the hatch and finds boxes of contraband. He mumbles that the bus is dirty and hangs up the phone. Hours later, Amanda hears a knock at the door. She opens it, and Jessie falls into her arms. He's dead.<br/><br/>Months later, the police have yet to identify the suspect. Amanda flies in a rage. She links the bus company to Jessie's murder. But the detectives don't know who owns it. Amanda looks up the bus company, and it leads to a church. She will assume a new identity, join the church, and find out who owns the Blacktop Bus Line. She believes it will lead to Jessie's murderer. Can she unmask a killer before the culprit takes her out first?<br/><br/>This thriller followed the groundwork of In Too Deep, but it lacked the suspense or plot twists. Amanda becomes a honey pot to trap her husband's killer and bring down their illegal enterprise. This wild ride with sex, espionage, murder, and Lifetime cops comes to a disappointing stop. Lifetimers will assume a big reveal or twists that never come to fruition. The sound quality, easter eggs, and editing were noteworthy. While the actors did their best, they couldn't suppress a dull story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Dr. Sarah hosts a podcast. Listeners call in with their issues, and she gives them advice, heartfelt truths, and encouragement. A conglomerate, Wellburst, wants her show. They are willing to pay substantially more and cover her relocation fee. Sarah takes the contract and asks for more time. Then, Leon runs into the roomâ€”someone called in a bomb threat.<br/><br/>Detective Jake meets everyone outside and questions them. He assures Sarah the threat was a hoax, but wants to know if she has any enemies. Jake gives Sarah his business card for the future.<br/><br/>Sarah returns to work and takes Edward's call. He becomes increasingly hostile, and Sarah contemplates hanging up. However, Edward admits he's holding someone Sarah knows hostage. If she doesn't reveal her secrets, proving that she is inept, then he will kill the hostage. This exposure may ruin Sarah's career, medical degree, and family. Can she save a life with hers on the line?<br/><br/>This film is the definition of messy. Sarah is a woman who maintains a put-together appearance for the media. However, her world is in shambles. As Edward forces Sarah to reveal every secret, you will clutch your pearls for a moment. However, only one secret is detrimental. The ongoing investigation is at best lackluster. The overall culprit isn't a surprise, although the writers have a few red herrings. This film's pace is steady, but the ending is sappy and anticlimactic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Gethsemane's students sing at Eamon's ceremony to kick off the 1st annual McCarthy days. Eamon happily pops in to see the unveiling of his statue. Then, they remember Gethsemane's brother, Jackson, is coming to visit. She can't wait. Before Jackson arrives, Gethsemane warns Eamon that Jackson doesn't know she got her father's gift of seeing ghosts. She needs his help to maintain a low profile.<br/><br/>Jackson arrives, and Gethsemane opens her arms to him. Gethsemane takes him around town and introduces him to her friends. They stop at Siobhan's pub and see Shannon putting up missing persons flyers for her father, Captain MacLachlan. He went out on his boat a few days ago but never returned. After a fun night, Gethsemane leaves Jackson to prepare tomorrow's lesson.<br/><br/>Later, Siobhan calls the last round. Jackson sees a man named Ray with a violin. The exquisite piece stuns Jackson. Ray quickly closes the case and leaves with the instrument, but forgets his sack. Jackson remembers that Ray was staying at the hotel across the street. He grabs the sack and runs over. Jackson sees something out of the corner of his eye and cautiously walks over to investigate. He finds Ray on the ground and a hooded figure running away. He checks Ray's pulse and can't find it. Someone killed Ray.<br/><br/>Gethsemane arrives at the hotel and worries about Jackson's safety. Gethsemane walks to the pier and calls to the heavens for Eamon's assistance. He appears by her side. Eamon can't help her, but he know someone who can: Captain MacLachlan. Captain MacLachlan tells Gethsemane that Ray killed him. Gethsemane has to find the killer of a killer to keep Jackson safe.<br/><br/>Inspired by A Gethsemane Brown Mysteries by Alexia Gordon, this film adds a new layer to Gethsemane's gift, family, and friends. Similar to Ghost Whisper, Gethsemane sees her abilities as a blessing and a curse. This script introduces Gethsemane's brother and expands on her father. Also, Hallmarkies get a hint of love on the horizon for our newest sleuth. However, it doesn't let the mystery fall to the wayside. It involves history, the black market, and a new ghost. The sky is the limit for this series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Captain Tom put Detective Peyton on a new case. Someone attacked a podcaster, Erin, in her home after she announced her upcoming tell-all. She killed her intruder, but the police uncovered that someone had hired him. So, they put Peyton in police custody until they can reveal the mastermind.<br/><br/>Peyton takes Erin to the safe house, but the mastermind strikes again. Tom tells Peyton to focus on her upcoming vacation. She will visit her parents to celebrate their anniversary. Peyton promises she will make it home to see Lucy's qualifying match. Peyton agrees to put work aside for her family.<br/><br/>After a successful anniversary, Peyton struggles with her luggage on the plane. A passenger, Samantha, offers to give Peyton the first-class seat next to her. During the fight, Samantha's mood changes. She warns Peyton that her associate has Peyton's daughter, Lucy. If Peyton wants Lucy to live, then Peyton will tell her Erin's location before she lands. Samantha shows Peyton a picture of Lucy, bound and gagged. Peyton stresses that she is no longer on the case and doesn't have access to that information. Samantha doesn't care. What will Peyton choose?<br/><br/>This film is a refreshing thriller for Lifetime. The writers used an effective countdown clock, setting it to the landing of the flight. The writers added someone's life on the line, with another's in the balance. Samantha is a clever contract killer who considers all the variables. Any creative way that viewers consider warning the flight crew, Samantha has a response. This film delivers and is worth your time and full attention.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jingle writer Laura arrives to find a crisis at work. Their singer is ill and can't sing their latest jingle. Laura's co-worker, Zoe, recalls that Laura can sing. Zoe convinces Laura to add the vocals to the song. Laura presents the jingle as a rough draft, but the client loves her voice. After the meeting, Laura's boss wants Laura to write a new jingle in a week. If it goes well, she will promote Laura to the Head of Marketing.<br/><br/>Earlier, Zoe admitted that she secretly entered Laura's song into the Harvest Lane Showcase songwriting contest hosted by country superstar Jackson Walker. Laura's song won. Laura panics because Jackson is her ex-boyfriend. Zoe emails Laura the release form in case Laura changes her mind. Later, Laura's boss emails Laura the release form for the jingle. Laura signs it, but the boss doesn't get it. She opens the email, signs it again, and emails it back. The boss finally receives the updated contract. After the call, Laura reads the first release she signed. It was for the contest. She panics. Without explaining the details, Laura must obtain the rights to her song from Jackson. However, he won't let the love of his life go that easily.<br/><br/>This love story has a predictable conflict, romance, and resolution. It follows the rom-com keypoints from beginning to end. The entertaining moments are watching Laura regain her confidence in writing and singing. Although he likes her jingles, Laura rediscovering her drive for music is more captivating than the romance. This film is a mindless watch with a country twist.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
