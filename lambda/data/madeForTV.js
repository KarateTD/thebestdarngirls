    "review":"Clarisse has nightmares several times a week about the kidnapping of her son, Jaden. Although officers found Jaden safe, Clarisse lives on high alert. Her husband, Walt, believes Clarisse should be over the incident because it happened years ago. She sits with her therapist, Dr. Martin, and updates him on her household. She is at odds with her teenage daughter, Allie, and she hovers over Jaden while lashing out at him.<br/><br/>Clarisse works at a Domestic Violence Resource Center to complete her Master's Degree. A woman, Cherry Redvine, comes into the center with blood dripping from her wrist. She escaped her boyfriend, Billy, and now needs help. Clarisse tells Cherry the center can help and gets Cherry comfortable. During the first group session, Cherry introduces herself and tells everyone that Billy calls her Blossom.<br/><br/>Billy enters the center's back porch late at night and threatens Lauren. He tells Lauren to deliver a message to Cherry. He is back and wants Blossom to return to him. Or Else. Cherry leaves the center without a backup plan. Later, Clarisse sees Cherry begging strangers for money in a grocery store parking lot. So, Clarisse offers her home to Cherry. Slowly, Clarisse's breakthrough becomes a break-in that puts her family in danger.<br/><br/>This movie's plot goes all over the place while attempting to make a statement. Cherry displays a bold demeanor but falls into the cycle. While it frees Clarisse emotionally, it leaves her without a career and husband. It's not until the final scene that Clarisse's character resonates. She finds her voice and lets everyone know.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Can Q clear his name and reclaim his life?<br/><br/>This film breaks the 4th wall with quips and insights from Q.. This break allows the viewer to understand what's on Q's mind. Q is an intelligent guy living in a rough area with zero street smarts. However, his likable demeanor endears him to his friends and family. While the storyline has mystery, it doesn't capture your attention. Q is in a troublesome situation, but everything is a joke. And the missing lenses in his glasses are distracting. This film is background noise with a few laughs.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
