    "review": "The R and B duet Luscious leaves the stage for an intermission. Group member Neveah goes to the dressing room and has a celebratory drink with their manager, Lenny. Lenny can't wait because their next album, Pheonix, is coming out soon. Outside, group member Lupita airs her frustrations to her husband, Marcel. Lupita thinks the music industry is slowly destroying them. Lupita marches to Lenny to declare that Luscious is over and storms off with Marcel. Lenny maintains that Luscious doesn't exist without Lupita and cancels the album. He rips up their headshots and leaves Neveah in tears. Lenny's son, Izaak, picks up the shredded images as Lenny yells at him.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Neveah can't find work in the music industry, and her rent is due. She meets with a music executive, Quinten, but he won't listen to her sing. Quinten calls security to escort Neveah off the premises, and she screams. Their encounter goes viral. Quinten calls Neveah because another producer saw the video and wants to work with her. Neveah runs to the studio but doesn't want to work with the unknown producer. She turns her back to pack her guitar, and the producer puts a rag over her mouth and nose. Neveah awakens in a locked studio. Neveah rushes to help another prisoner and removes the head covering. But she's taken aback to see Lupita.<br/><br/>Neveah and Lupita's issues arise as they argue about the past. Then, the producer walks in and talks about how their music impacted his life. They write him off as a crazy fan until they get a second look. It's Izaak. They must make three songs to complete their unfinished album. In exchange, Izaak will give them their masters and freedom. Neveah says yes because the masters are a guaranteed paycheck. When Izaak leaves, they devise a unique way to alert someone to their location and escape. Will it work, or will their issues boil over?<br/><br/>This movie attempts to mix Misery with You and Star. The plot is far-fetched but lures you with Neveah and Lupita's drive. They use their musical and sexual prowess to outsmart Izaak. It's their bickering that turns you off. The viewer will want to know more about Izaak's relationship with Lenny. The setting was flawless for captive musicians. Also, Izaak displayed the perfect amount of craziness. The music will capture your attention when the story doesn't. This film entertains if you don't overthink it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Executive Recruiter Casey waits for her co-workers at her favorite restaurant to celebrate her birthday. She notices the handsome gentlemen standing next to her when her friend, Jess, pulls Casey into a hug and escorts Casey to their table. The man, Henry, sits with his family to celebrate his birthday but has made them promise not to sing.<br/><br/>Casey and Henry bump into each other while they set their gifts aside. Henry manages a farm, but Casey senses he wants more. He admits that he wants to own a farm. They discover they are birthday twins. Since Henry's family forgot to order a cake, Casey offers to share hers with them. They close their eyes, make a wish, and blow out the candles. Then, Henry gets a call from an unknown number.

Casey believes their birthday wishes got swapped. She meets with Henry and asks for his wish. He admits to wishing for a farm. She lights the candle to swap wishes. Henry relents and tries to swap wishes. However, it doesn't work. Then Casey has an idea. She will hire Henry to run the farm and earn extra money to buy property. But only if Henry accepts the TV show and invites her to join him. He agrees to the arrangement. However, the show isn't the only wish Casey made. Will her birthday wish list bring more for them?<br/><br/>This film has a unique concept but the ending falls flat. The audience must speculate if Henry and Casey won the competition. The dancing montage and standup routine are the standout moments of this film. Everything else is background noise. Hallmarkies should save this movie for a rainy day.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Gloria fusses with her dress as her mother, Queenie Mae, makes alterations and fixes Gloria's hair. Queenie Mae says it's God's design to have Gloria sing. Queenie Mae leaves the room while Gloria gabs with her sister Irma. Then they hear a horrible thud.

She sees a picture of a handsome man. It's the singer's brother, Officer Linwood. Gloria declares he will be her husband. Her connection to Linwood pushes her to her limits and away from God while she climbs the charts. Can Gloria find her way back to God while losing everything?<br/><br/>Gloria Gaynor's story goes beyond one song or genre of music. And it continues to this day.

This subplot circles back to Gloria's final career decision at the movie's conclusion. The film gives the audience a glimpse into Gloria's personal and professional struggles but won't garner new fans. However, it will solidify her current audience.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Reality Bites: A Hannah Swensen Mystery",
    "review": "The Cookie Jar bakery is abuzz. A cooking show star, Connie Mac, will use Hannah's bakery to film on location. The producer, Hunt, meets with Hannah before the crew arrives. Connie doesn't have time to make the food herself, so the crew assists while Connie hosts.<br/><br/>Detective Lonny and District Attorney Chad compare notes before Chad's case at the Lake Eden Municipal Building. They caught a serial burglar who hit 13 homes. Chad will litigate the case against him, and Lonny will be the first witness.<br/><br/>Hannah arrives at her bakery, and Hunt introduces Hannah to the team. Costume designer Louise gives Hannah a branded apron. Food stylist Evan hands Hannah a list of the recipes. Minutes before they air, Connie enters and briefly waves at Hannah. Hannah is in awe until she discovers Connie's secret: Connie can't cook. She pulls Hunt aside, and he agrees to discuss the matter with her later.<br/><br/>Hunt explains that his mentor, Buddy, created the show. Buddy believed a female host would appeal more to a female audience, so Buddy chose Connie to host the show instead of Hunt. Hunt wants to elaborate, but Hannah has plans. She gives Hunt a key to the bakery so he can set up before the crew shows up.<br/><br/>Hannah arrives at her shop, and the crew is waiting outside. Hannah opens the door and finds Hunt dead on the ground. The police shut down the show and the bakery because now it's a crime scene. Hannah's shocked when the medical examiner wants to declare Hunt's death due to natural cases. Then, Hannah remembers an article about the burglaries on Hunt's computer at the scene. Lonny believes Hannah is correct. Chad tells Lonny to investigate Hunt's death as a murder until Lonny proves otherwise. Can they discover who killed Hunt and why?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Blueberry Muffin Murder by Joanne Fluke, this movie is top-notch sleuthing with humorous quips and excellent character growth. The plot offers several suspects but doesn't lead you to the killer. It allows the final reveal to be a surprise. And all the plot points will converge on one scene. This film is one of the best in the Hannah Swensen series. It's comical, romantic, and compelling.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
