However, the subplot is about a family coming together and showing up for each other during a traumatic event.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Simone, Bailey, and Parker have reservations to stay in a high-end resort for Parker's 30th birthday, thanks to Simone's influencer sponsorship. The concierge, David, introduces himself and flirts with Simone. When the women check-in, they see a college-friend-turned-enemy, Kate, enter with her entourage. As they start to argue, Simone leaves to talk to management about their room. When she returns, Bailey and Parker can see that Simone is upset, but she won't tell them why.<br/><br/>They find cake, champagne, and David in their room. He lights the candle for Parker and leaves. Simone reveals another surprise for them. She got VIP passes to the hottest nightclub in town. The women do tequila shots and head to the club. They prepare for an epic night until Kate and her crew sit beside them. Upset, Simone and Kate argue as the owner, Antonio, approaches. He offers them free top-shelf bottle service all night if they don't fight in the club. Simone joins her friends, enjoys free drinks, and takes ecstasy.<br/><br/>The friends wake up in Kate's hotel room. They have no idea of how they got there. When they return to their room, they get horrible news. David tells them Kate died by falling off the balcony. Bailey, Simone, and Parker sit poolside and figure out what to do. They go through their phones and delete any potential evidence, including an argument. However, someone else posts the video, and the detectives declare Kate's death a murder. Simone, Parker, and Bailey must stay one step ahead and find the culprit before they end up behind bars for a murder they didn't commit.<br/><br/>The plot sets up these three women with issues so they have a reason to escape and throw caution to the wind. This script sets itself apart because their good and bad decisions all backfire. This movie has love triangles, theft, backstabbing, and pure stupidity. While the film has a strong plot, the story falls flat with a comical fight scene and childish behavior. The film tries to pack a month-long soap opera drama into a few hours. If you stick with the movie, your first suspect will be correct and wrong. So, watch to discover the killer, but don't expect much from the performance.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
