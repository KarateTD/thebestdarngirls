    "mtitle":"Office Race",
    "review":"Pat sleeps late, eats terribly, and spends more time watching Fast and the Furious movies with his friend, Dave, than working out. Pat puts the same effort into work as his personal life. He goes to work, and his boss, Liz, calls Pat into her office along with Pat's co-worker, Spencer. Liz got a promotion to the national branch and selected Spencer to replace her. She informs Pat that he is a mediocre employee at best. She warns Pat that he needs to land the deal tonight to keep his job. Or Spencer, Pat's former underling, will fire Pat.<br/><br/>Pat goes to the bar with Spencer to meet Rita. Then, Spencer notices her '26.2' tattoo and asks Rita if she is a runner. They discover that they are running the Sweet Peach Marathon. Pat interjects with a lie. He tells Spencer and Rita that he is in the marathon and running for Breast Feet Forward, Rita's charity. Rita invites Pat to run with her team.<br/><br/>Pat meets up with Rita and her teammates - Harry, Kiki, and Don - for practice. They start their first practice, and a car hits Pat. Pat has a few bumps and bruises, but Dr. Julie says Pat will be fine. Then Julie states she is a member of Rita's team also.<br/><br/>Pat meets with the group again for another run. The group breaks for a stretch, and Pat takes off his shirt. The team winces at his nipple chafing as Spencer and his team emerge from the nearby river. After some verbal jousting, Spencer and Pat make a wager. If Pat beats Spencer across the finish line, Spencer has to donate $100 to Breast Feet Forward. But if Spencer wins, Pat has to give money to Spencer's charity. This race isn't about client relations. Now, it's about Pat's pride. For once in Pat's life, he must give his all.<br/><br/>This movie has an easy wit and comedy staples. Pat made great strides in his life in three months. However, the writing falls apart the closer Pat gets to race day. Spencer slowly turns into Gollum and talks like a zombie. The film goes from funny and believable to weird and boring. Office Race had a strong start but hit the wall like a marathon.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love in the Great Smoky Mountains: A National Park Romance",
    "review":"Archeologist Dr. Haley sits with her advisor, Dr. Ettinger, to discuss Haley's next career move. Haley applied for the Arizona Pueblo Grant but wants to publish a paper to give her a fighting chance. So, she will join a dig in the Great Smoky Mountains led by Dr. Carl Smith.<br/><br/>Haley meets Carl and thanks him for the opportunity. She looks up and sees her college ex-boyfriend, Anthropologist Dr. Rob. They immediately bicker, and Carl stops them. Rob and Haley applied for a grant during their senior year, but Rob didn't tell Haley he inquired about it too.<br/><br/>Later, Rob and Haley find common ground and meet for lunch. He admits that he applied for the Pueblo grant too. Haley is happy he didn't keep this a secret like college. They call a truce so they can start their prospective work. Rob brings Haley to the lab and introduces her to Troy. Troy is proud to share his culture with Haley and Rob.<br/><br/>Rob and Haley spend more time together and walk the trails. Haley and Rob get separated during their hike, and she discovers a unique cave. The structure is too small for her to enter. So she grabs her phone, inserts her hand inside, and takes pictures. Rob believes it confirms the Cherokee myth about a large diamond with magical powers. Haley believes her first article should focus on the findings, and it will guarantee her the grant. As she considers receiving it, Haley realizes it could be the end of her fresh start with Rob.<br/><br/>This film provides a beautiful look at Cherokee culture and discusses the Removal Act. Also, they call it Ancient American History, not only Indigenous. And that slight difference ensures viewers understand that Indigenous History is American History. The lessons will spark your interest, but the romance is dull.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
