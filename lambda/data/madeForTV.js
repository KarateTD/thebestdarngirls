    "mtitle":"Would You Kill For Me? The Mary Bailey Story",
    "review":"In February 1987, Willard Sims came home drunk and screamed at his wife, Veronica. Then, a shot rang out in a quiet community. Veronica calls the police and tells them she shot Willard. The police arrive with their guns drawn, but Veronica's story changes. She tells the police her 12-year-old daughter, Mary, shot Willard to protect her. Ella, Veronica's mother, tells the police that Mary acted under Veronica's command. After Willard dies, the police take Mary, Veronica, and Ella to the police station.<br/><br/>The police give the three women a gunshot residue test before separating them for questioning. Veronica points the finger at Mary. Ella says Mary did it too, but under Veronica's command. The lawyer promises Mary that she won't have to testify against her mother. The police let Ella go, put Mary in foster care, and arrest Veronica. Veronica and Ella give their version of the story during Veronica's trial. However, the judge can't ignore the blaring conflicts. Mary will have to give her version of the truth. What story will she tell?<br/><br/>Based on My Mother's Solider by Mary Elizabeth Bailey, the movie gives you three sides to a story. These stories are emotionally complicated, but it's nothing compared to Mary's. Her story tells viewers how abuse can impact the entire family. And seeing it through everyone's perspective is masterful storytelling. It's not a comfortable story to witness, but it is worth every minute.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Margo runs up to Charlotte's apartment and invites her to go out for fun. Charlotte says no because her designs are behind. Charlotte designs clothes for her luxury clothing boutique, Alastair. She creates unique, high-end clothes with expensive fabric. Margo and Charlotte walk downstairs to the store as Charlotte gets a call from her mother, Olivia. Olivia updates Charlotte about the family and Elfcapades. It's the last year of the Elfcapades. Charlotte does a double take because the townspeople love the weeklong Christmas celebration. Charlotte informs her mother that the shop must come first and that she needs to focus on her designs.<br/><br/>Charlotte walks into work to find water leaking from the ceiling and her fashions water-damaged. The building owner tells Charlotte the pipe burst. It will take a week to fix. Charlotte doesn't think Alastair can recover from the damage if they miss the Christmas shopping window. Then, Charlotte gets a phone call from Roger Warwick. His store hosts a Christmas Design Contest. Margo put Charlotte's name in the contest for her.<br/><br/>Charlotte meets with Roger to learn more about the contest. His customers like affordable, inclusive, and wholesome clothing. If Charlotte decides to enter the contest, she must make one design for men and women to wear during Christmas following his store's aesthetics by Christmas Eve. The winner will have their design sold in his store and get a deal to design for him. This exposure is what Charlotte needs to save her company. Margo reminds Charlotte that Roger wants a wholesome family design, so being with her family could spark creativity. Charlotte will return to Brooksbend.<br/><br/>Charlotte daydreams during her drive and crashes into the truck. The truck driver, Spencer, gets out to inspect his vehicle and assumes the 'big city' girl is a texter. Spencer, a mechanic, offers to take Charlotte's car to his shop and fix it while she is in town.<br/><br/>Her family convinces Charlotte to come to the local diner and cook Christmas cookies. Charlotte chooses to go and spots Spencer there. They decide to work in the back room to retreat from the crowd. With several events ahead of him, Spencer asks Charlotte to be his buffer to scare off flirty women. Charlotte will do it only if he will be her model and sounding board for her design. They agree to help each other in life but unwittingly do it in love, too.<br/><br/>Inspired by Jingle Jammies by Robyn Neeley, this movie will have you rooting for the wrong character. It delivers the first kiss early and points out the misunderstanding. However, Charlotte and Spencer are both immature. Its redeeming qualities are Charlotte's and Spencer's character growth at the conclusion. If you need some background noise for two hours, watch this.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maddy runs with her boyfriend, Ian, to improve her time before applying to Superior University. Maddy hurries home because her stepsister, Devon, is back early from school in London. Maddy and Devon never met because their parents eloped in Las Vegas without telling them.<br/><br/>Maddy's mother, Laura, greets Maddy at the door and introduces her to Devon. Maddy calls her best friend, Gia, and updates her about Devon's creepy behavior. They all sit and eat dinner with Devon's father, Kent. Gia comes over during dinner to go out for coffee with Maddy. Laura politely insists that Maddy should invite Devon to come along.<br/><br/>The coffee outing didn't go well because Devon and Gia taunted each other. Devon reveals that Kent's ex-fiancé took her life before the wedding, and her biological mom died when she was 5. Laura's updated blueprints for the home take Devon back because her mom designed it. Laura promises not to make sweeping changes and asks Maddy to set the ladder up before Maddy goes to school. Maddy locks the ladder in place and meets Ian and Gia at school. Then, she gets a call from her mother. She fell down the stairs because the ladder collapsed. Maddy remembers Devon was home. She believes Devon tried to kill Laura, but can she prove it?<br/><br/>So, let's get this straight. Devon's father got married without telling her, moved her stepsister into her room without letting her know, took a family photo without her, and put her broken photo with her dad in a closet. And she was supposed to be ok with this. No, murder isn't the answer, but Devon had a reason to be upset. This movie checks plenty of boxes if you have your LMN bingo card handy. It has a shellfish allergy, asthma, a nosy friend, and a staircase. And the final fight scene will tickle you. This movie isn't a favorite of the Shocktober season, but it will make you chuckle inappropriately.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
