    "mtitle":"My Child Has My Doctor's Face",
    "review":"Jessica and Dylan decided to try IVF after infertility issues for 3 and a half years. Today, they have a happy and healthy baby boy named Henry. She mistakenly grabs another boy and notices he looks identical to Henry. She shakes the thought out of her mind and takes Henry to his annual checkup.<br/><br/>After the visit, Jessica walks into the hallway and sees the boy from the playground, Evan, and his mom, Sarah. The women look at each other and their children as Dr. Preston Bellamy exits his office. Jessica smiles at Preston, remembering he was her fertility doctor, but Sarah leaves disgusted.<br/><br/>Jessica gets Henry's annual results, and he has a clean bill of health. She sees Henry's blood type is O positive like hers and questions Dylan about his. Dylan says he is A B negative, which causes Jessica to research blood types on the internet. She finds Preston's video. It states that an O and A B parent will produce an A or B child.<br/><br/>Preston gives a few reasons why Henry's blood type is O, but Jessica has evidence to the contrary. She openly wonders if Preston's office had a mixup, and Preston explodes. Later, Sarah catches up to Jessica. She believes Evan and Henry share the same father, Dr. Preston Bellamy. Sarah wants Jessica to join her so they can go to the police and report Preston for fertility fraud, but Jessica isn't ready to accept it. She wants to talk to Preston again. However, Preston blatantly ignores Jessica. So, she joins Sarah on a frightening road to the truth. Can they get Preston to admit what he did and make him pay?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie alters the motive but maintains the doctor's sick mentality. Donald Cline committed his crimes because he was a part of the Quiverfull belief. However, Preston will die in a few months. Then, the script involves married adults keeping secrets from each other and risking their safety with foolish decisions. Jessica and Sarah's investigation skills are worse than a Lifetime cop. If you want to root for the creepy villain, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Locked in My House",
    "review":"Professor Caris meets with her friend, Julia, after class. She updates Julia about her fertility progress. Caris got an appointment with the country's top fertility clinic, Hope and Beginnings, and excitedly beams. Caris and her husband, John, plan a romantic evening. Unfortunately, John can't attend the appointment.<br/><br/>Caris arrives at the clinic and meets Dr. Marrick. He wants to perform tests to determine her reproductive health. Dr. Marrick sexually assaults Caris during the exam, and Caris freezes. Dr. Marrick leaves the room before Caris cries. She quickly dresses and notices something in the ceiling. She stands on the exam table and finds a camera. She opens his laptop and finds security footage of his exam rooms.<br/><br/>Caris immediately reports Dr. Marrick's crime to a detective. Julia tells Caris to post the incident on social media. Caris's story goes viral overnight. Caris goes home to check her post. She sees messages from several of Dr. Marrick's victims and starts a support group.<br/><br/>Renee approaches Caris after the group and admits Dr. Marrick assaulted her too. Caris leaves and goes to Dr. Marrick's office, intending to break in. Caris sees Dr. Marrick stumbling out of his office and into his car. He drives to the railroad tracks and passes out on them. Caris pulls him off the tracks before the train arrives. Caris takes Dr. Marrick to her home, ties him up, and puts him in the basement. Caris keeps her cool with friends and family. However, the police find Dr. Marrick's abandoned car on the tracks. Caris must find justice without anyone uncovering Dr. Marrick locked in her house.<br/><br/>This movie has a 'Ripped from the Headlines' feel but changes into the LMN plot when Caris kidnaps Dr. Marrick. She doesn't have a thorough plan about what to do during or after. She wants to uncover the truth but doesn't realize that Dr. Marrick is evil. And her disguise is more comical than scary. This movie has an emotional start, a funny middle, and a satisfying but quick conclusion. It's not horrible but mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Killer Fortune Teller",
    "review":"Shane is the CEO of Settel Pharmaceuticals after his father died and passed it to him. Shane wants to start a hostile takeover. A board member calls Shane's sister, Olivia, to the conference room to talk some sense into him. Olivia warns Shane that their father wouldn't have done this. Shane mocks Olivia's concern because their father depended on fortune tellers to make business decisions. Then, Shane gets an email from The Optical Initiative and chooses to visit the store.<br/><br/>Shane browses the store when Maya approaches him. Maya tells Shane she isn't a fortune teller but an intuitive offering guidance. She asks if he wants a free tarot reading, and Shane curiously accepts. Maya reads his cards and predicts good fortune after death. Shane scoffs at Maya's prediction and leaves.<br/><br/>Later, Shane's competition's CEO dies after falling down the stairs. Now, Shane can buy his company without a hostile takeover. His erratic change causes Olivia to worry that Shane is falling down the same charlatan rabbit hole as their father. Olivia wants to prove Maya is a fake, but Olivia doesn't know that Maya is deadly.<br/><br/>This movie sprinkles hints about the motive, but it's easy to decipher before the antagonist's monologue. There are two benefits to this movie. First, Olivia is a hard-working and driven woman. And Detective Rita is a helpful and intelligent cop. This dynamic duo makes this film watchable.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secrets of the Pastor's Wife",
    "review":"Angie and her women's prayer group laugh and gossip when they notice the new pool boy, Jason. Angie walks over and introduces herself. The other women giggle, but Angie assures them she only has eyes for her husband, Pastor Jim.<br/><br/>Jason fixes the pool after a water feature malfunctions. Soon, Angie purposely breaks things and flirts during Jason's visits. Angie goes to bed feeling lonely. She gives in to Jason the next time they meet. While Angie finds it exciting, Jim's sermons make her feel guilty. After receiving a threatening anonymous note about sinners, Angie calls off the affair. However, Jason is obsessed. When someone murders Jason, will Angie's affair come to light and make her the number one suspect?<br/><br/>This movie wraps a scandalous romance with a mystery. However, the mystery falls flat. While the script points at multiple suspects, average Lifetimers can spot the antagonist. Viewers will sympathize with Angie's behavior because Jim is condescending, dismissive, and boring. You won't care when Angie has an affair despite Jim's profession. Also, Jim receives cryptic, threatening messages too. So, the audience will assume he is doing something sinful. This movie is a case of 'everyone sucks,' excluding Angie's sister, Catherine, and Angie's friend, Sarah.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
