    "review":"Dawn enters the dorms, ready to start her new life at Bernhardt School of the Arts. But her housemother, Agnes, gently reminds Dawn that she can't leave Cutler's Cove behind. Dawn's grandmother, Lillian, called and spewed lies about Dawn to Agnes. Dawn inspects her room as Tricia enters and ingratiates herself to Dawn. The two girls become fast friends, and Dawn slowly reveals her secret past.<br/><br/>Tricia guides Dawn around campus and points out Michael Sutton's flyer. The famous Broadway thespian will teach a class at the school and is holding auditions to attend. Tricia and Dawn try out and get a spot on Michael's student roster. Dawn proudly stands as she gains a new life outside the Cutler name. But one misjudgment will bring Dawn back to the Cove with new secrets to unveil.<br/><br/>Based on Secrets in the Morning by V.C. Andrews and the sequel to V.C. Andrew's Dawn, this movie starts slow, but that's intentional. The plot takes time to show viewers that Dawn is intelligent but naive. When Dawn's secret comes to light, she falls into Lillian's clutches and past. Dawn gets a glimpse into the darkness that created the devil. This movie leaves viewers and Dawn stunned with earth-shattering news with an ending hinting at part 3's insanity.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Podcast to Die For",
    "review":"Lacey and Cam had a whirlwind wedding, expecting a baby, and recently moved into their forever home. This pregnancy will be Lacey's first baby, but Cam is a widower with two daughters - Maddie and Kira. Cam and Lacey disagree about the girls working with Lacey. Lacey is the host of a true crime podcast. Cam doesn't want the girls exposed to murder and violence.<br/><br/>Lacey comes to work, and her researcher, Valentine, questions Lacey about maternity leave. Lacey's co-worker, Bianca, wants Lacey to wrap up their current episode and start something new. Valentine thinks that two unsolved murders are connected. If the killer follows their pattern, the killer may strike again soon. Lacey, Bianca, and Valentine choose to take the case and shine a light on the victims - Sara and Marissa. Lacey will regret it because an online troll starts attacking her in real life.<br/><br/>Lifetime tried creating a mystery but doesn't because it falls into its predictable patterns. While the plot is average, it does provide commentary on true-crime watchers, listeners, and creators. Are they profiting off others' pain or giving the victims a voice? Watch this movie if you need to burn two hours or need a break from compelling H.M.M. mysteries.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Royal Christmas Crush",
    "review":"Ava's uncle, Karl, calls her for help on his latest project. He is building an Ice Christmas Castle for the royal family. Since 1857, the family commissioned architects to create an ice castle near their residence with events that culminate in the Royal Christmas Ball. The project will bring recognition to Ava and her firm, so she says yes.<br/><br/>Ava arrives and marvels at Karl's work. He shows her around the castle and updates her on the royal family. Ava sees a picture of Prince Henry and gawks. Brigitta, the Royal Family handler, corrects Ava's gaze and tells Ava the Prince is off-limits. Karl tells Ava to steer clear of Henry and focus on work.<br/><br/>Henry meets with his advisor, Deputy Von Teir. Teir hands Henry the latest tabloids and tells Henry to focus on finding a queen. Teir suggests Henry date Brigitta's daughter, Sigrid, and invite her to the ball. Henry declines because he wants to find true love, like his parents did, not a royal match.<br/><br/>The Royal Family stop by the castle to approve the work. Henry sees Ava and stops in his tracks. Ava shows Henry the property and takes him down the slide. They believe their growing romance will go unnoticed. However, Brigitta wants Sigrid to be the future queen. So Brigitta will stop at nothing to get Ava out of the picture and Sigrid by Henry's side. Can Ava defeat Brigitta's conning ways?<br/><br/>This storyline is more predictable than water making things wet. The writers didn't bother to give the King and Queen names. This 'Christmas in July' film barely mentions the holiday and has zero Christmas spirit. It's no wonder they released it in July. Skip this film unless you need background noise.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
