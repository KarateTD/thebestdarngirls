    "review":"After their move, Hannah and her mother, Melanie, have wildly different views about the town. Hannah's first day at school reminded her that she is an outcast.  The popular girls ignore her, and her music teacher, Mr. Kurtz, wasn't impressed by her audition for his intensive music program. The school's guidance counselor, Mr. Garrett, offers a sympathetic ear whenever Hannah needs it.  As Melanie and Hannah get pick-me-up mac and cheese, Hannah receives a text from a boy she bumped into at school.  His name is Tanner, and she develops a quick crush. After a social media fail, Hannah, saves Amber's life.  Amber is a popular cheerleader that makes everyone miserable. Next, Amber invites Hannah to a party.  Hannah's life starts to look up, but she feels like someone is watching her.  She tries to ignore the feeling until someone leaks nude pictures of her to the whole school.  Devastated, Hannah doesn't realize this is step one in someone's murderous plan.<br/><br/>While this movie offers a decent mystery for the price of admission, the how goes by in a blur.  The writers put more focus on exposing the killer's past than explaining how the killer framed Hannah. During the killer's monologue, the backing track drowns out the explanation for why the killer picked Hannah to frame.  This revelation is helpful to the overall plot. Even with all the Lifetime tropes, this movie is watchable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Keeping Up With the Joneses: The Wrong Letter",
    "review":"Detective Murphy interviews each of the Jones women, individually, about Carlos's shooting but gets nothing from them.  Although the police backed down, Pam tells everyone to keep their eyes and ears open. Pam believes she knows one enemy, Web.  He sent threatening letters in the past after they didn't take his deal to buy their company.  But Pam has one more person she wants to keep an eye on, Robin.  With her controlling interest in the company, Robin only needs 2 of the Jones sisters on her side to sell the company, and it worries Pam. Carrie is more focused on the new man in her life, Lance Jenkins, an investment banker. Kayla can't focus on the business because she is keeping her attention on her fiancé, William. However, Tara took her eye off the ball and wants to quit school and doesn't want to attend college. With each sister having a high level of mistrust, they have no idea Robin's in trouble until they get a ransom demand.  Either the sisters pay the money, or they will kill Robin.<br/><br/>The second chapter in this saga keeps dishing the dirt on this Pacific Hills royalty.  With a recap, in the beginning, you don't need to see the first chapter to enjoy this installment. Each woman has a crooked or new person in her life, so you aren't sure who kidnapped Robin.  However, you will watch and scrutinized everyone's actions and reactions.  This part will have you chomping at the bit for part three.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"College Professor Obsession",
    "review":"After losing her track scholarship due to an injury, Jenny starts college in the winter semester with a part-time job and goals to run again.  Her R.A. Kyle introduces Jenny to her roommates, Beth and Sara. At the student union, Jenny learns the tragic fate of Sara and Beth's previous roommate, Elaine.  Elaine fell off a roof during a party, but some believe she committed suicide because her grades dropped dramatically. When she and Beth come back to the dorm, they find a hooded man in their room.  Jenny stabs him in the shoulder, but he runs away. During her first class, Jenny's history teacher tells her that her participation isn't wanted.  Then, her psychology professor, Dr. Davrow, tells her to dress sexier if she wants good grades.  Jenny can't believe Dr. Davrow exchanges sexy outfits for marks.  When she tells Beth, Beth tells Jenny to play along as she does.  At first, Jenny says no, but she changes her mind to get a scholarship.  When Dr. Davrow goes too far, Jenny decides to report him.  Now her life is in danger.<br/><br/>Dr. Davrow will give you the creeps.  This professor goes beyond any level of decency and adds victim-blaming to his list of depraved actions.  He is a character you will love to hate.  The movie tries to point you in another direction, but the perpetrator's maneuvers will give them away. This movie won't be a favorite, but it's not a waste of time.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie attends the Christmas pageant for her youngest daughter, Sophie, but feels out of place.  Her ex-husband, Jeff, brought his new girlfriend, Kate.  And Maggie's oldest daughter, Mia, would rather sit with them.  Maggie puts on a brave face because this is the first time she will be without her daughters during the holidays.  When Jeff lets this information slip, Kate invites Maggie to their Christmas vacation in Aspen so Maggie can be with Sophie and Mia.  Maggie says yes. Kate's dad, Ted, introduces himself, and Kate directs Maggie to a guest room, and the in-suite steam room astonishes Maggie.  After a quick steam, Maggie walks out and sees a man standing in the room.  He's Sam, Kate's brother, and he's back from Tokyo to surprise his family for the holidays. After a bumpy introduction, Kate tells Sam that Maggie creates campaigns, and he is intrigued.  Seeing the unspoken competitive nature between Maggie and Kate, Sam offers to help because he understands what it is like to be in Kate's shadow. He needs Maggie to create a pitch deck for him. She agrees to help. Their collaboration sparks a moment of love that everyone can see.  Will the mom competition get in the way?<br/><br/>While it's easy to believe that Maggie and Jeff will reconnect, the plot shuts this thought down at the beginning.  This movie is a love story between Maggie and Sam.  But the not-competition competition between Kate and Maggie can be confusing until you hear both women talk about their connection to the children. While it's a different story for the channel, it just doesn't grasp your attention.  Keep this one on the back burner for a rainy day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Framed by My Husband",
    "review":"Rick Lowe's novel just made the New York Times bestsellers list, and he wants to celebrate by starting a family with his wife, June.  However, June has aspirations of becoming an author too.  And she doesn't want to have children until she finishes her first novel. June tells her sister, Maggie, that Rick doesn't respect her, but Maggie thinks June is overly sensitive. One day, June gets the mail and finds two vital correspondences.  The first is Rick's bonus check, and the second is a blackmail letter.  A woman claims Rick sexually assaulted her.  And if Rick doesn't pay $50,000, she will tell the police and go public. At the designated drop-off, Rick tells June she should give the blackmailers the money. June agrees to do the drop.  At the location, June calls out to the waiting car, but no one comes out.  She opens the car door, and a dead woman falls out.  June grabs the body and sees a dead man in the passenger seat. With a coat covered in blood, June explains to Rick what happened.  She tells Rick she saw that woman in a hospital the day before with bruises.  The woman's name was Wendy Bach.  He tells her to relax and keep quiet. The next day, June preoccupies herself with the news coverage of the two bodies found in a parking lot with stab wounds.  The police identified the man as Wendy's husband, Simon.  Before June leaves to spend time with Maggie, the police come to the front door.  They have evidence that June had an affair with Simon and told him to leave his wife or else.  She tells them about the blackmail and gets the briefcase of money to back up her story.  But inside it is her bloody coat and the murder weapon.  Rick is the only one who knew about the bloody clothing, and she knows he set her up. June wakes up handcuffed to a hospital bed with questions from Maggie about the murders. With no one on her side, June breaks out of the hospital and crashes her car into a river.  The police declare June dead.  But she is not, and June will exact bloody revenge on Rick.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best 'framed' movies on Lifetime.  Within the first 20 minutes, the writers lay down the plot and its full steam ahead. This film depicts acts of sexual assault, so there should be a trigger warning for survivors of this crime. With all the positives, the antagonist's monologue is ridiculous.  See if you can spot the fatal flaw in his plan.  However, if this movie won't trigger you, then be prepared to be very entertained.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
