    "mtitle":"Kidnapping in the Grand Canyon",
    "review":"Brooke finishes her rounds at the hospital and goes home to pack. She and her friend, Chandra, are celebrating the friendship anniversary by hiking the trails of the Grand Canyon. The women drive to their hotel and settle in but can't find a pizza restaurant that delivers. Chandra finds a flyer for a local pub and suggests they visit.<br/><br/>Brooke and Chandra laugh about their friendship when Brooke hears a man yelp in pain. She runs over to the bartender's aid and sees he has glass stuck in a large gash on his hand. She informs him that she is a doctor, pulls the large glass fragment out of his wound, and wraps the area. Brooke and Chandra walk towards the front door, and Nate bumps into them. He is a tour guide for the Grand Canyon and offers to show them around. She politely turns down his offer, but Chandra can see the chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Nate overhears Brooke and Chandra debating about their hike and interjects. Brooke wants to stick to her plan, but Chandra wants to take off-trail sites. Nate knows them well and offers to guide them. Brooke relents. Nate, Chandra, and Brooke sit after hiking for an hour. Nate offers them some protein bars. Brooke notices a small rip in her packaging. She decides to keep it, and they talk.<br/><br/>Brooke wakes up in a cave with a rope around her wrists and ankles and Chandra sleeping by her side. Tara tells Brooke that Nate kidnapped them like he did to her. He took Brooke because Tara got an injury during her abduction. Nate gives Brooke aspirin, but she joylessly laughs. Tara needs something more potent. Nate kisses Tara and promises to return to his 'fianc√©e' with the medicine. He grabs Brooke to use her medical license to get the necessary medication.<br/><br/>Chandra and Tara sit in the cave. Chandra asks Tara why Nate took her as Chandra tries to undo the ropes. After three months of dating, Nate proposed to Tara. Tara thought Nate was sweet, but it was too soon. So she said no to marriage. He kidnapped her and put a ring on her finger a week ago. Will the three women survive Nate and the elements of the Grand Canyon?<br/><br/>This movie follows the same guidelines as Vanished in Yosemite. The final fight is the film's saving grace. But it doesn't grab your attention. These film slates are Lifetime's answer to Hallmark's National Park Romance series. Instead of finding romance with a helpful stranger, they discover evil and death. Save this on your DVR when you need to kill two hours yelling at the screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"As Luck Would Have It: Murder 101",
    "review":"Detective Lisa and her partner, Detective Rick Anderson, sit in the car and listen to the radio. Anderson turns on the 'As Luck Would Have It' podcast. Lisa rolls her eyes at the expressive host and turns the radio off when the host, Gabbi Luck, says Lisa's name. Gabbi is a retired criminology dean and professor. And she is Lisa's mom.<br/><br/>Gabbi visits her friend, Dean Charles, and interrupts his meeting with Professor Brian. When Gabbi was the dean, Brian wanted to make tenure, but Gabbi thought Brian was too young. However, Charles is considering giving Brian the coveted position. Brian leaves, and Gabbi notices the broken window in Charles's office. He brushes it off as par for the course. Afterward, Gabbi sits with Charles and discusses her future. A woman, Christy, approaches Charles during his conversation with Gabbi and demands to talk to him. Christy storms off, and Gabbi can feel the tension. She warns Charles to stop having affairs with his students because his wife, Meghan, could find out.<br/><br/>Lisa meets with Gabbi for lunch, and Gabbi can see that Lisa is uneasy. Lisa blames Gabbi's affair for breaking up her parents' marriage. Lisa tried to call Gabbi earlier, but Gabbi left her phone in Charles's office. Gabbi decided to get it in the morning.<br/><br/>Lisa's boss, Captain Taylor, calls Rick and Lisa into his office. Someone killed Charles, and Taylor wants them to find the murderer. Taylor believes Lisa will solve the crime faster to clear Gabbi's name because earlier they found Gabbi's phone at the murder scene. Can Lisa solve the crime before Gabbi is the latest subject of the podcast?<br/><br/>This film is part one of a three-part series and will command your attention. Gabbi is strong and fabulous. Gabbi remains relaxed with each biting word from Lisa. She understands Lisa's frustration and anger towards her. And the audience needs to have the same compassion too. With all the family drama, the plot spins an intriguing mystery. You have viable suspects and a red herring. Also, the writers didn't go for the easy choice for their culprit. It allows viewers to play along. This film is a promising start to a new mystery series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Napa Ever After",
    "review":"Real estate lawyer Cassandra sits with her friends and expresses her work concerns. Cassandra hasn't gotten the ruling on her most recent case. If she loses, her boss, Joyce, could fire her. Cassandra's friends remind her that they can take a long-awaited trip to Napa Valley to see where Cassandra spent her childhood if she gets fired. However, Cassandra wants to stay the course. And she avoids Napa because of family tension. Then, Cassandra gets a call informing her that her grandmother, Emma, died.<br/><br/>Cassandra goes to work, and her assistant, Hank, tells Cassandra that Joyce wants to see her immediately. She squares her shoulders and prepares to get fired, but Joyce promotes Cassandra to partner because she won. Cassandra accepts the job but asks for two days off to attend Emma's funeral.<br/><br/>Cassandra sits at her desk when a lawyer calls about Emma's vineyard. Emma left everything to Cassandra. Cassandra plans to settle her grandmother's estate and sell the vineyard after the funeral.<br/><br/>Cassandra travels to the vineyard and finds Emma's best friend, Isabel, in the home. After the funeral, Isabel hands Cassandra letters from Emma. Emma reconciled with Cassandra's daughter and wanted Cassandra to keep the land in the family. Cassandra decides to take a 6-month sabbatical from work to run the vineyard.<br/><br/>Isabel greets Cassandra at Emma's home and introduces Cassandra to the vineyard manager, Alec. As Emma aged, he helped Emma run the vineyard and manage the crew. Cassandra asks Alec to give her a crash course about running a vineyard, and Alec and Isabel laugh.<br/><br/>Seeing the vineyard needs a lot of work, Cassandra goes to the bank to obtain a loan. The bank manager tells Cassandra the land is underwater because Emma mortgaged it to the hilt. Then Alec gives Cassandra more unfortunate news. The vineyard only bottles the vintage wines. They don't make wine or host events anymore. Cassandra needs to turn it all around or sell her family's legacy. It's time for Cassandra to roll up her sleeves, ask for help, and find love.<br/><br/>This film is what you expect. A big-city attorney goes to a vineyard and finds peace in open spaces with a handsome widower and single father. The ending isn't a surprise. The movie separates itself because Cassandra learns about her mother and Emma reuniting through letters. Cassandra also uncovers why her mother left the vineyard and how her parents felt about it. One final yell puts everything into perspective and helps Cassandra guide her decisions. Those moments make this film worth watching.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Vanished in Yosemite",
    "review":"Jennifer and her sister, Katrina, go kayaking in Yosemite National Park. Katrina wants to go off-script and have fun. But, for Jennifer, a plan is fun. Katrina relents to Jennifer's itinerary, and they go to dinner. They converse when Katrina sees a handsome man, Rick, sitting at the table beside them.

However, Katrina gets his number.<br/><br/>Plans derail in the morning because Jennifer gets food poisoning from dinner. Katrina puts Jennifer in bed for the day and hikes with Rick. Katrina and Rick stop to use a public bathroom, but Rick suggests Katrina leave her backpack behind. He takes the opportunity to spike her water and encourages Katrina to drink it when she returns.

Katrina wakes up tied to a bed in a cabin as Rick plans with his friend to kill her.<br/><br/>Jennifer feels better but worries about Katrina. It's been hours since Katrina texted, so she calls Rick. Rick doesn't pick up, and Jennifer's tension grows. Jennifer takes a deep breath and calls her ex-boyfriend, Wally, for help. Wally quickly turns Jennifer down but regrets it and calls her back. He agrees to travel to Yosemite and help Jennifer find Katrina. Can they save Katrina, or will they become victims too?<br/><br/>Jennifer is supposed to be the heroine but is entitled, unhelpful, and ungrateful. Most of Wally's hunches and suggestions are correct and lead her in the right direction. Katrina doesn't sit around waiting for someone to rescue her. She tries to fight back, get under Rick's skin, and attract attention. The movie's saving grace is the last 3 minutes. Jennifer and Katrina band together to take Rick down. You will laugh. Save this on your DVR when you must kill 2 hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Hiding from My Husband",
    "review":"Jessica looks at her black eye and decides to leave her husband, Peter. Jessica puts a stash of cash and passports for herself and her son, Noah, in her purse. She calls her sister, Rachel, for a ride. Rachel asks if she can come later, but Jessica knows now is the only time. She looks out the window and panics when she sees Peter walking to the front door. Jessica runs out the back and flags down her Uber driver. Jessica goes to Noah's school and forcefully pulls him out of class. They jump in the car and travel to Rachel's house on a remote island city.<br/><br/>Jessica and Noah settle in with Rachel. Rachel promises this will be a fresh start but warns Jessica that Peter incessantly calls. Jessica gets Noah's phone and walks to the beach. She checks the slew of voicemails Peter left. They range from loving to sympathetic to mean to threatening. Jessica is on high alert with friends, family, and strangers. After Peter dies, Jessica can't shake the feeling that Peter is still a threat. Is she right?<br/><br/>This movie is Enough mixed with The Invisible Man without giving viewers a deep sense of fear. The writers foreshadow the twist, but viewers won't invest in the plot enough to care. Jessica displays the PTSD survivors often deal with after leaving their abuser. Also, Noah isn't a brat. He understands why they left and shows the proper response to sudden life changes. The twist feels forced and fast but adds something new to the obvious conclusion. If you can get past the poor wardrobe choices, this is watchable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
