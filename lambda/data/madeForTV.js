    "review": "Members of a grief support group go on their annual hike. Evie has the most experience, and the trip means everything to her. Her daughter, Rachel, died on this trail. Former pastor Jan, hiker Bea, and lovelorn Hope welcome their newcomer, nurse Maya, into the group.<br/><br/>They set up camp and turn in for the night. The bear steals Bea's backpack before leaving. In the morning, Evie discovers that Bea brought scented toothpaste on the trip, attracting the bear. But learning that Bea took the map earlier and left it in the bag with the satellite phone causes Evie to rage. If they don't check in, the rangers will send a search party for them. The search will be their fault and cost them thousands of dollars. Evie remembers seeing smoke. She wants to find those hikers and use their phone to alert the rangers.<br/><br/>The group stumbles upon an empty cabin and enters. Evie hears a thump under the floorboards and the women investigate it. They find a little girl named Alice living under the house. She wordlessly relays that she isn't safe. So they take her with them for protection. However, they are in danger. Alice's kidnappers consider Alice to be family. And they are ready to kill to get her back and keep their secret. Will the women make it out of the woods alive?<br/><br/>This film makes the most of its surroundings by having the actors traverse through rugged terrain and snow-covered grounds. They used natural light instead of a soundstage while providing sage advice for campers. The writer had a concrete understanding of wilderness and survival training. Seasoned Lifetimers can easily predict the story's conclusion and the unsurprising reveal. The characters offer astounding advice for dealing with grief, friendship, and healing. While the plot isn't strong, the guidance will renew you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Dylan hides in the bathroom with his lunch as his bully, Sawyer, enters. Sawyer makes rude comments about Dylan's mother, Courtenay, bites Dylan's sandwich, and throws it on the ground. When Dylan remarks, Sawyer pulls him to the ground and makes Dylan eat it. Dylan's friend, Meredith, barges into the bathroom and stops Sawyer. Later, Meredith and Dylan work on their chemistry project. Sawyer pretends to apologize before making sexual comments about Courtenay again. Dylan finally attacks Sawyer, and the teacher sends them to the principal's office. Courtenay, Dylan's father, Ben, and Sawyer's mother, Andrea, sit with the principal. He updates them on the fight, but doesn't punish the teens.<br/><br/>Dylan and Meredith laugh in the cafeteria when Sawyer starts to harass Dylan. Dylan verbally stands up for himself. Sawyer takes his sandwich, eats it, and chokes on it. He collapses to the floor and dies. After school, Detective Cathy comes to Andrea's home. Sadly, Cathy tells Andrea that he died. Detective Cathy brings Dylan to the station. They uncovered Dylan and Sawyer's squabbles, and Dylan is their number 1 suspect. However, they don't have enough to hold him. So, Detective Cathy lets him go. Courtenay and Ben want to protect their son because they think he is innocent. But will that change when Courtenay overhears Dylan say he is guilty?<br/><br/>First, Lifetimers will feel that Sawyer got what he deserved. He was a pathetic person, receiving horrible advice from his brother, Evan. Second, Courtenay and Ben make terrible decisions. When the culprit reveals their motive, it will solidify both points. Unlike other Lifetime films, the killer's monologue isn't the end. The conclusion offers one more twist to shock experienced watchers. The actors draw you into the story, and the script doesn't foreshadow. Give this film your undivided attention.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Alice and her husband, David, move into their new home. Alice goes inside to prepare for a dinner with her new boss, Sydney. Alice searches for her earrings and stumbles across a box with letters addressed to David. He says they are trash he can't throw away yet. He grabs her earrings off the fireplace and hands them to her.<br/><br/>Alice wakes up in the hospital two days later. The nurse and doctor call her Ellie. Alice goes against the doctor's wishes, checks herself out of the hospital, and jumps into a rideshare home. Alice knocks on the door, and David answers. But he doesn't know her. His wife, Alice, comes downstairs and doesn't recognize her either. She faints while David calls the police.<br/><br/>Officer Wiley sits in the hospital cafeteria with Alice, whom he calls Ellie. He tells her that David has been married to Alice for 20 years and has pictures of them together. Alice tries to call Sydney, but Sydney is at a corporate retreat. Wiley promises to examine Alice's claims but warns her to stay away from David and his wife. Alice can't sit back while another woman steals her family. Can Alice discover who is behind the deception and why?<br/><br/>This movie is a well-written mystery with a mediocre motive. The script leads Alice down a path of unforeseen incidents that leave her alone and without a past. This plot builds at a steady rate and offers a decent body count. The culprit's monologue is subpar and should be fixed with counseling, not murder. It's a shame that a brilliant character was wasted on this motive. Lifetimers should watch this film for the twists and turns, not the conclusion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Alien Addison and Zombie Zed are small fish in Mountain College. Addison, Zed, Willow, and Eliza get in Zed's car to spend time together before leaving to attend their respective camps. Although they haven't seen much of each other in college, Zed and Addison believe their relationship can survive the distance.<br/><br/>Zed crashes the vehicle after an electromagnetic pulse causes his Z-band to short-circuit. They decide to spread out to find help. Addison walks through an invisible barrier and into a town of perpetual night. It's run by vampires. They assume she is their sworn enemy: a daywalker. So, the vampires prepare to strike, except for Victor. Victor is the leader's son. He has bigger dreams of venturing out in the world. Maybe he will see the girl he dreams about. Victor's mother, Eldress, puts him in charge of Addison. They will use her to help gather blood fruit from this year's harvest. Luckily, they possess the dark stone, which strengthens their powers.<br/><br/>Zed stumbles past an invisible barrier into a bright world of constant daytime. The daywalkers see his green skin and assume he's a vampire. Before they attack, Nova begs them to stop. She asks Zed to smile for her father, Commander Bright, to prove he doesn't have fangs. Commander Bright believes Zed has a strong back and puts him to work under the watchful eye of Nova, the future leader. They walk to the harvest with the intent of beating the vampires to the blood fruit. Their source of power comes from their light stone.<br/><br/>Everyone sprints for the harvest, but finds a locked gate with a force field. It has 3 locks with riddles. Before the daywalkers and vampires battle, Zed, Addison, Willow, and Eliza convince them to join forces and stay at a local abandoned camp. Commander Bright orders Nova to work with the vampires until they find the blood fruit. Then, take it all for themselves. Eldress warns Victor to be a leader and take control of the situation. Eliza searches for the electromagnetic pulse that caused the crash. As the pulse gets stronger, it will reach Seabrook. It will break all the Z-bands, causing the zombies to 'zombie out.' Can they get the daywalkers and vampires to solidify their truce and save Seabrook?<br/><br/>This fourth installment in the Zombie franchise is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. The dancing, music, and choreographed dances are sharper and more refined than before. The veteran actors' skills shine through as they usher new monsters into the fold. This film mixes the themes of prequels with a hint of Romeo and Juliet. The moral is overcoming history and becoming your true self. Enjoy this film with the family and prepare for a sneak peek of Zombies 5.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sarah takes her daughter, Ruby, on a road trip to college. It's been six years since Ruby's dad, Michael, died in a hiking accident. So, Sarah wants to spend as much time together as possible. They stop at a convenience store, and Sarah pays for her items with a stack of 100-dollar bills before leaving the store. A man jumps from behind Sarah's car and offers to look it over because he saw oil leaking. Sarah cautiously refuses his help because she had the car serviced a month ago.<br/><br/>As they head down the road, Sarah gives Ruby pepper spray and warns Ruby to take it everywhere. Then, their car breaks down, and they don't have cell reception. Later, Allie pulls over to help and offers to drive them to Shelly's diner. However, Sarah doesn't want to leave the vehicle alone because it has their supplies inside. Ruby convinces Sarah to let her ride with Allie and call for help. Sarah relents.<br/><br/>Sarah waits in the car, stares at a family photo, and reminisces. A truck drives by and kicks up dirt, causing Sarah to drop her photo under the vehicle. She looks for the picture and sees an unplugged connection. Sarah connects it, and the car starts. She travels to the diner and sees Allie sitting at a table. Sarah settles and asks where Ruby is, but Allie says she's never met Ruby. Sheriff Hoffman enters and polls the diners. None of them saw Ruby either. The sheriff takes Sarah in for questioning. Hoffman believes Sarah is the problem. He leaves to speak to another officer, and Sarah receives an image with a text for her to find Ruby. Sarah slips out of Hoffman's office and rushes to the site.<br/><br/>Sarah finds the area, but Ruby isn't there. She sits in a café and panics when Jane sits. Sarah remembers that Jane was one of the diners in the restaurant. Jane warns Sarah that something sinister is going on in the town. She warns Sarah that Hoffman can't be trusted, as well. Jane and Sarah are on a mission to find Ruby before she is lost forever.<br/><br/>This movie begins with a plot well-known to Lifetimers. They make mistakes, and someone, typically an ungrateful teen, gets kidnapped. The culprit will stand out to experienced Lifetimers, but the motive is the twist. The kidnapper is a master puppeteer who manipulates everyone around them. Also, the culprit played the long game, waiting months to make their move. The recap will leave your jaw on the floor. If you can sit through an ordinary build, the conclusion will knock you for a loop.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
