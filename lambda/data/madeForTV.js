    "mtitle":"The Wrong Housesitter",
    "review":"After a last-minute work obligation, Dan's girlfriend Mary can't housesit while he is away.  Dan has no choice but to find a housesitter.  At the book store, Dan bumps into Kristen.  Kristen mentions she is an aspiring writer taking odd jobs like waitressing and housesitting until she gets a book deal.   Dan stops in his tracks when he hears she is a housesitter and hires on her on the spot. Kristen takes the job, leaves references, and plans to come back the next day.  Dan is elated he found a sitter at the last minute.  His elation is short-lived.  Dan makes a rookie mistake of signing a contract without reading it.  Now, he won't be able to get rid of Kristen for a year and her obsession with him is growing.<br/><br/>This movie is a huge build-up to a disappointing ending.   Kristen adds spy cameras, redecorates, moves in, and racks up a body count and ... nothing happens.  You will expect more from this plot after it took so much time talking about contracts, tenets versus houseguests, and squatters' rights.  You will want some sweeping declaration for a change in the law but nothing happens.  Maybe their will be a part two to finish the story but this movie just seems unfinished.<br/><br/>2 out of stars.",

    "mtitle":"Friends Who Kill",
    "review":"Lacy is falling behind in all her subjects and uses her parents looming divorce to distract them from her failures. At school, Lacy's friend Harper bumps into a new girl. The new girl introduces herself as Cassie. Instead of apologizing, Cassie asks the girls for directions to homeroom. Since Lacy is in the same homeroom, Lacy offers to walk Cassie. Cassie and Lacy discover they have a lot of the same classes, have parents going through a divorce, and they are both doing bad at school. Lacy is just happy to have a friend who understands. This caring friendship will become manipulative, dangerous, and deadly.<br/><br/>At first, you know Cassie is dangerous. However, you don't know why she latches on to Lacy. A seasoned Lifetime viewer will assume Lacy's dad's affair is the focal point of the obsession, but you are wrong. It's oversharing on social media that brings a deadly situation to Lacy's doorstep. So, keep this movie in the queue for a girl's night in.<br/><br/>3.5 out of stars.",

    "mtitle":"Amazing Winter Romance",
    "review":"Julie's inspirational column has been lacking inspiration. Her boss tells her she needs to change or lose her job. Her boss suggests she go back to her home town to enjoy the winter and gain some inspiration from family and friends. After getting some baked goods, Julie hears a little girl begging her dad to go to the maze. At home, her parents hint that her ex-boyfriend Nate is doing something with all their snow and she should check it out for herself. Julie goes to Nate's and is impressed to see he used all the town's shoveled snow to make a huge snow maze.  Julie finds more than the path through the maze, she finds a path to love.<br/><br/>This common storyline tries to grab your attention with a big snow maze but it's not enough to keep your interest. If you decide to watch this movie, DVR it so you can pause it and solve the maze when it's on your screen. Everything else in this movie just falls flat and is unmemorable.<br/><br/>2 out of stars.",

    "mtitle":"Roux the Day: A Gourmet Detective Mystery",
    "review":"Henry meets with Eric on behalf of Eric's client.  Eric's client heard the Belvedere chef's book is going up for auction and his client wants to buy it. The client wants Henry to examine the long-lost book.  If it's real, Henry has carte blanch to buy it at auction. Just one tiny problem.  It's the same day he promised to go to a Giants game with Maggie.  Maggie is slightly disappointed to miss the first half of the game but she agrees to go to the auction with him.  Before the start of the auction, the auction house sold the book.  So Maggie jumps into action.  She goes into the main office and finds the receipt with the buyer's name.  They go to the antique store and find the owner of the book dead on the floor with a hint of perfume in the air and the sound of the back door closing.  With the book nowhere in sight, Henry and Maggie have to solve a murder and a theft.  It will take a legacy, a windmill, and the click of a mirror to bring the killer to justice.<br/><br/>Pull out your pen and paper because you will need it to keep up with the suspects and their motives.  With each clue, the plotline gets wilder.  So keep both eyes open to everything in a scene. What makes this installment so good is everyone involved has their side motive along with the bigger plan.<br/><br/>5 out of stars.",
