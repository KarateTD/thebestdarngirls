    "review":"Jetsetting Alex is ready to spend the holidays with her family in Switzerland. After her father passed, Alex's mother, Carol, bought a B and B in Switzerland. She plans to open on New Year's Day, so time with the family will help Carol work out the kinks.<br/><br/>Carol introduces Alex to the chef, Louis, and the general manager, Liam. Quickly Alex sees that the B and B needs help, and she offers Liam some assistance. He gladly accepts and introduces Alex to his son, Kelby. While they connect, Andy pulls Carol aside. He wants to know if Carol told Alex that Beth and Nadine are coming. Carol whispers no and tells Andy to keep her secret until Carol tells Alex. Beth and Alex were best friends until Beth started dating Alex's ex-boyfriend, Jesse. So Alex cut Beth, Beth's mom, Nadine, and Jesse from her life. Carol thinks Alex should bury the hatchet and forgive Beth and Jesse. If she can't, will it ruin Alex's chances with Liam?<br/><br/>Christmas in Switzerland sounds magical, but this movie doesn't grab your attention from beginning to end. You will perk up when Kelby talks about his mom, but nothing else stands out about this movie. Alex is letting her bitterness poison her future with Liam. By holding on to the past, she can't trust anyone in the present. That's Alex's lesson. This film won't be a favorite of the season, but it's watchable for 2 hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ariel meets with her realtor, Erica, at a small cottage. The owner accepted Ariel's offer, and now Erica hands Ariel the keys. Ariel and Erica bump into Nick during the walk-through. Nick explains that he is showing his client, Mark, his new property. This information dumbfounds Erica, so she and Nick call the owner for clarity. Nick and Erica discover that Ariel and Mark rightfully own the property for the same price. Since possession is nine-tenths of the law, Nick and Erica say whoever leaves the property before December 26th loses the cabin. If they last until then and can't decide on an owner, they both give up the property and can't purchase it again. Ariel and Mark draw their battle lines and prepare for war. They will use every trick in the book to force the other person to leave, but their families see the love behind the battle and encourage Ariel and Mark to see it.<br/><br/>This movie goes from wild to funny to charming. First, the setup of dual ownership feels like a stretch. Then, this film becomes a PG War of the Roses as they battle over the house. Finally, Ariel and Mark call in the big guns to cement their spot. That moment is when viewers see the sweet and loving reason they both want the cottage. It will warm your heart to hear the reason behind their madness.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ana mentioned she needed more money to attend nursing school, so her friend, Ester, showed Ana listings for a private caregiver job in the area. Ana calls and makes an appointment to be interviewed by siblings Jason and Carla.<br/><br/>Jason and Carla's mother, Joan, has early-onset dementia with sundowning. They would need Carla to live with Joan and take extra precautions at night. After a few questions, Jason hires Ana on the spot and wants her to start this Tuesday. Carla vows to keep a close eye on Ana.<br/><br/>Ana meets the quick-witted Joan and gets settled. After a few hours, Ana can see the family dynamic. Joan is a savvy businesswoman that keeps a tight reign on her kids. Jason sees Carla as the golden child, while she labels him as the screw-up.<br/><br/>Ana puts Joan in bed and retires to her room for the night. But she hears moans coming from Joan's bedroom and goes inside. She sees that Joan is visibly upset about someone being outside her bedroom. Ana reassures Joan that Joan is safe and promises to care for Joan. However, Joan has a right to be fearful. Someone is after her, and they want to blame Ana.<br/><br/>This movie proves just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you. Someone could explain away Joan's fears, but Ana does everything possible to stay vigilant. However, Ana is up against the LMN trifecta. She is in a house with poor cell coverage, with no Wi-Fi, and her patient has a nut allergy. The plot attempts to throw viewers curveballs, but it won't fool you. While the end is foreseeable, Ana's fighting spirit is commendable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Summer takes a deep breath and offers Vivian a place to stay.<br/><br/>Vivian brings in her things, but Summer's daughter, Chloe, can't take her eyes off Vivian's Christmas Village.
