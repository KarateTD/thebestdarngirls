    "mtitle": "Girl in the Attic",
    "review": "Billy watches social media reels at work when he spots his former acting student, Kelsey. He follows her page and finishes his work before going home. Billy runs into his neighbor, Mrs. Bird, who expresses concern about Billy's mother, Debbie. Former dancer Debbie is housebound after an accident damaged her spinal cord. Now, she depends on her medication, wheelchair, and Billy. She accuses the cleaning person of stealing from her. Billy proves the laborer is innocent and that Debbie's memory fades. Feeling foolish, Debbie tells Billy to get out more and find a girlfriend. She gives him money to change the attic into a gym.<br/><br/>Kelsey starts a social media account to track her progress and collect donations. She plans to run a half marathon in her mother's honor for breast cancer research. Kelsey sticks to her program for weeks before deciding to run 10 miles. Kelsey runs, and a man, Billy, in a vehicle, asks if she's seen a golden retriever. She states no. Kelsey walks away, but Billy drugs her and puts her into the trunk. Kelsey awakens in the attic to chains around her ankles and wrists. She begs Billy to let her go home. He gives her a choice: to be his wife or die. Can Kelsey escape a deranged madman, or will Billy's double life crack him?<br/><br/>Billy is an evil, manipulative person. The script quickly and quietly explains Billy's pathology, with his quips about his mother's work and the red-pill podcast playing in the background. He didn't change suddenly. It slowly brewed over time. The writers used a lot of foreshadowing, so pay close attention to small, insignificant items. The makeup department did a spectacular job on Kelsey's look. They gradually applied enough to enhance her suffering. This film will make you sick to your stomach, but it's worth one viewing.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Allie and her fiancé, Nick, smile as Allie's father gives a speech during their engagement party. Those smiles change when Nick's ex-girlfriend, Vanessa, crashes the party. The police take Vanessa away while Allie tries to focus on her party.<br/><br/>Nick and Allie argue about Allie's future. She explains her frustrations to Nick, but he hears blame. Nick tells Allie to figure it out and goes to work. Allie's best friend, Maya, arrives. She planned Allie's bachelorette party in her family's summer cabin. Maya, maid of honor, invited their friends, bridesmaids Steph and Kat, to come. Allie relents.<br/><br/>Allie, Maya, Steph, and Kat eat at a diner before driving to the cabin. They notice Allie staring into the distance, and Maya calls her name. Allie swears she saw someone staring at her, but they weren't there. The women pack up and drive further down the road. They pull over, get out, and Allie sneaks away to call Nick. Maya, Steph, and Kat get a notification stating Vanessa is out of jail. Kat and Steph want to tell Allie, but Maya convinces them not to. Finally, they arrive at the cabin and expect to have a fun bachelorette weekend. In the end, one person dies, one gets stabbed, and two will be in handcuffs.<br/><br/>This getaway is the most depressing bachelorette party ever. Allie is a whiny, rich girl who would rather complain than take action. It's no wonder Kat drank so much. This script becomes boring because it spends so much time on them and their issues. Viewers forget the breadcrumbs the writer provided in the first 30 minutes. The plot doesn't get exciting until the last commercial break. This method of taking the long way to the point doesn't work in a film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Seduced by His Lies",
    "review": "Terri tours an open house and sparks a conversation with realtor Ann. Terri likes the house but doesn't want to be impulsive. Ann encourages Terri to buy the home before a bidding war starts. Terri takes the leap of faith and enters a bid.<br/><br/>Months later, Terri calls her boss from the back of a rideshare. She quit her job because the boss gave her a promotion to his nephew. Terri arrives at home, drops her keys, and plops on the bed. She notices someone else's phone and clothing. Marcus enters with a bat, and Terri screams. He yells at her to get out of his house, and she echoes him. Then, they call the police.<br/><br/>The officer informs them that they are victims of real estate fraud. He gives Terri and Marcus Detective Hewitt's business card. He is the head of the department responsible for fraud. Terri packs her items and leaves to go to a hotel. But the police officer arrests her for credit card fraud.<br/><br/>Detective Hewitt meets Terri in an interrogation room. He believes the real estate con artist and the identity fraudster are the same person. Hewitt warns Terri that this will cause issues until she calls her bank. However, it's too late. The bank froze her accounts and credit cards. Marcus wants to compromise. He will stay in another part of the home, and she can have the bedroom. They will work together to find the realtor who scammed them. Marcus makes himself a worthwhile guest with tremendous cooking and great looks. But is there more to him than meets the eye?<br/><br/>This film is precisely what you would expect, with one twist at the end and a high body count. The writers need the viewer to know that anyone can be the victim of a real estate or love scam. The premise is intriguing, but the acting falls short of expectations. They are not believable as a couple or as adversaries. Viewers should watch this when they need to procrastinate.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Wedding Contest",
    "review": "Wedding planner Taylor is excited because a famous influencer, Cherish, wants to discuss her upcoming nuptials. Taylor brings her portfolio to Cherish's home early. She starts filming for social media on Cherish's lawn, and the sprinkler starts, soaking Taylor's outfit. Taylor hides behind the bushes and sees a car pulling into Cherish's driveway. She begs the driver, Benedict, for his jacket while explaining her situation. He laughs and decides not to help her because he's a planner too.<br/><br/>Cherish's fiancé, Will, invites Benedict inside, and they discuss Will's ideas for the wedding. Will and Cherish explain that they love Benedict's and Taylor's work respectfully. However, they can only choose one for the wedding. So, they want the planners to learn more about them and create a design. The best design will win their business. Benedict and Taylor draw their battle lines. Taylor plans to win the wedding, but will she win more?<br/><br/>This film is the comic relief fans look for in a romantic comedy. Benedict and Taylor use every trick in the book without harming each other or their reputations. Benedict wants to propose to his girlfriend, Tiggy. However, June Groom fans know that she won't last. Benedict never cheats and speaks about Tiggy honestly and lovingly. So, Taylor never oversteps, even when she has feelings for him. This writing approach endears the viewer to the relationship while laughing. This movie is the best of the 'June Grooms' series because they aren't pursuing love. They stumble on it with humor and humility.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "To Barcelona, With Love",
    "review": "Anna looks around the bookstore and finds her book in the clearance section. Her manager, Beth, informs Anna that her fans didn't like the second book, Barcelona, My Love. Fans felt like Anna didn't know love or Barcelona. Then, Beth gets a call. A bookstore owner in Barcelona asks Anna to do a signing and reading at a festival. Anna agrees.<br/><br/>Erica walks around Barcelona, discovers a person reading Barcelona, Mi Amor, and smiles. She meets with her friend Mateo and gets some bread at his café. Then, Erica runs into her friend, Nico. Nico owns a bookstore and tells Erica that Barcelona, Mi Amor is a bestseller. So he called the publisher and asked if the writer could attend Barcelona's St. Jorgi's Day festival for a reading and signing. Stunned, Erica tells Nico to cancel, but it's too late. Then, Nico asks Erica to help Anna get acquainted with Barcelona. Later, she tells Mateo the truth. She was the translator for the book, and the publisher gave her some liberties. She rewrote the entire translation. If she tells Anna she translated the book, it will violate Erica's NDA and terminate her employment.<br/><br/>When Anna arrives, she assumes that Erica is her assistant. Erica corrects Anna and takes her around the city. But Anna connects to Nico more than Barcelona. She thinks her next book needs her life experience with love. A whirlwind romance with Nico might do the trick. Erica stammers because she's had a crush on Nico for years. She has a handle on her secrets until Nico asks Anna to write a short story exclusively for the festival. Can Erica translate the new story without telling Anna about the rewrite or Nico?<br/><br/>This film is the first of a two-part special. This first movie focuses on Erica finding her voice after happily living in the shadows. Anna isn't the antagonist. She is unaware of Erica's deception and is a kind foodie. Erica and Anna are two sides of the same coin. This message will speak to Hallmarkies and inspire their wanderlust. The conclusion is predictable, but the storyline is enjoyable. Hopefully, the next film will offer more to the fans.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
