She is ecstatic to see she has 1,000 new followers overnight.  But one of the followers is a stalker set on harming anyone that comes in between them.  This movie has great acting but an average script.  Lifetime fans will figure out the stalker in the first hour.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "For season 2 of her podcast, Alex decided to head back to her hometown to solve the mystery of Gina DeSalvo.  Gina DeSalvo was last seen leaving her job after getting her tips.  Her car crashed into a boulder and was recovered with blood on the windshield and no body.  Alex was determined to find her.  This mystery gives you a rare look into a sleuth's mind while she is figuring out the crime.  With the podcast, you feel more like a friend than a fly on the wall.  Hopefully Hallmark will extend this movie series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
