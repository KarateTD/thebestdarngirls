    "mtitle":"The Christmas Lottery",
    "review":"Nicole is an elite hedge fund manager in New York and plans to spend Christmas in Bali with a tiny bikini and her bonus.  Instead of getting a bonus, she gets a pink slip.  Tammy practices yoga with her boyfriend, Spyder, and tries to eat clean. He didn't pay the back rent because he used the money to pay their $2,500 studio fees.  Now, they have an eviction notice.  In Houston, Deidre helps her parents, Gerald and Diane, run the café and helps Gerald care for Diane because she has dementia.  And lately, she's had more bad days than good.  Deidre married her wife, Belinda, without the approval of Belinda's parents or her sister's presence.  Gerald asks Deidre to start a conference call with her younger sisters, Nicole and Tammy.  Gerald tells the family he won the lottery, worth $10 million, and he wants to collect the prize as a family. Deidre believes, without the promise of money, neither sister would be in Houston.  After having some fun together, Gerald walks to his safe to get the ticket, but it's gone. As Gerald ponders on what happened, Diane hums quietly to herself and reveals she took the ticket and put it in a safe place.  But she doesn't remember where.  The family has three days to find the lottery ticket, or they will forfeit the prize.<br/><br/>If you watch enough H.M.M. movies, you know the location of the ticket the instant it appears on the screen.  But that's not the focal point of the film.  It's the relationship between the three sisters that drives the plot forward. Luckily, they have Belinda.  She is the sister-whisper in times of need and crisis.  But don't worry.  With all the craziness, you get two love stories, a reunion, and an arrival.  This movie is worth a watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Beaus of Holly",
    "review":"Holly's life is going to her extremely-detailed plan accordingly.  Her greeting and stationery card company is doing well, and she reached the 2-year mark with her boyfriend, Phil.  The next step in her plan is to get engaged. He isn't proposing to her, however Holly will ask Phil to marry her.  She takes the train and meets Phil at Winterland.  Holly pulls out her camera, hits record, and gives her speech.  At first, Phil worries she is breaking up with him, but he figures out what Holly is doing and stops her.  Over the past few months, Phil took his ex-girlfriend and client, Tiffany, to dinner.  He feels Holly is too predictable and wants something different. Devastated, Holly cries and tells Phil to leave.  Then a man approaches her.  It's her coachman, Jake, and he is ready to provide Holly with her romantic Christmas ride.  Holly planned a list of fun Christmas-themed activities after Phil said yes.  But since he said no, she wants to leave it all behind and gives the tickets to Jake.  Every event is for two, so Jake invites her to come as his plus one.  Throughout hot chocolate tastings, visits to Santa's workshop, and a snowball fight, Jake teaches Holly to let go of the schedule and enjoy today.  However, the past isn't too far off schedule.<br/><br/>The moment the audience meets Jake, you know exactly where the story should go.  If you are an avid holiday movie watcher, you know the second Holly uses the word 'perfect' to describe her upcoming proposal, it will all go downhill.  Jake tells Holly to break away from the schedule and do something spontaneous. They decorate, eat, and laugh together.  Her day with Jake has more meaning than two years with Phil.  While the plot is predictable, the journey is fun to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Inn Love by Christmas",
    "review":"With her assistant, Greg, pushing her out the door, Amanda makes her flight back home to Hollybush.  After she lands, she tries to pick up her rental car, but all the cars are gone.  As she pleads with the concierge, Lucas recognizes her because they went to high school together.  He offers to give her a ride because they are going to the same town.  The concierge tells her to take it, so she does.  During the small road trip, Amanda admits she didn't come to Hollybush for vacation purposes only.  She convinced her company to buy the Chesterwood Hotel and turn it into a boutique version of their chain hotels.  If she lands the deal, she will get a hefty pay increase and move to the corporate offices.  Lucas drives Amanda to Chesterwood, and before they can knock on the door, Tammy opens it.  Tammy starts to gush about Lucas buying the hotel. Amanda stands in front of Lucas, completely dumbfounded by what she's heard.  The nice man who gave her a ride is her biggest competition.  Lucas remembers Amanda's competitive streak and prepares himself for a battle to the end.<br/><br/>The competition-becoming-love plot isn't the first of this season.  It's not even the first on this channel for the season.  Because of that, the film becomes background noise. While the chemistry between the characters was spot-on, it wasn't enough to make the plot intriguing. You will watch this one once and forget it.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Christmas for Mary",
    "review":"Lena works as a personal assistant for Vivian, editor-in-chief for Vibrant Magazine.  When she hears Vivian's challenge of finding a writer to come up with an uplifting and compelling holiday story, Lena throws her hat in the ring. If Vivian likes the topic, Lena will get the featured article and promotion to a staff writer.  At her mother's home, Lena looks in the basement and finds a painting done by her grandfather, Clarence.  In the artwork, a beautiful woman hangs an ornament on a Christmas tree.  On the painting, Clarence wrote 'A Christmas For Mary.'  Mary was not Lena's grandmother's name. It's hard for Lena and her mother to believe that Clarence loved another woman.   Lena calls Vivian and pitches her idea, and Vivian loves it. So, Lena travels to a place Clarence mentioned in his notes, Pineville, and attempts to look through the town's archive for more information.  But that tree of knowledge is unfruitful, so she gets a lead that Mary's family runs Mary's Café and she can find Mary's family there.  At the register, Lena meets Michael, Mary's grandson, and he is intrigued by her story. He offers to get any information he can.  In his quest, he finds letters Clarence wrote to Mary.  These letters will unlock the past of Mary and Clarence and the future of Lena and Michael.  But are Lena and Michael doomed to make their grandparents' mistakes.<br/><br/>A slow build to a complicated but fulfilling ending, this movie provides two mysteries for Lena to solve.  First, she needs to understand what brought Clarence to Pineville.   Next, she needs to discover why he didn't stay with Mary. This movie does require your full attention to keep up with the clues, but one viewing is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Santa Squad",
    "review":"Due to budget cuts, Allie's school removed the art program, and she lost her teaching job.  She goes to the Community center to see if they had any open positions, and the bus is driving away.  Tony, the community center director, sent the seniors on a cruise to close the center for the holidays.  But Tony didn't realize two of the seniors, Connie and Bill, stayed behind. Allie offers to volunteer to keep an eye on Bill and Connie while Tony spends time with his family.  Tony accepts the help and gives her a flyer for the Santa Squad.  The Santa Squad shops, decorates, and plans Christmas activities for families in a last-minute bind. He gives Allie the job for the Church family.  Gordon Church is a widowed, high-powered CEO with two daughters, Iris and Rose. Kimmy is Gordon's girlfriend, and she hired the Santa Squad to handle the clean, minimalist, and expensive decorating around Gordon's home.  When Allie arrives, she meets Gordon's assistant, Daniel, and he gives her two boxes of decorations for the whole house. Then Allie meets Iris, and Iris tells Allie how she wishes they could be more hands-on for the holidays because they have never decorated.  Allie goes home and creates a Master List of Christmas fun activities for the girls to put them in the Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, the master list will cause a break-up, a lost job, and a fire.  Will Allie be able to give Rose and Iris the Christmas of their dreams?<br/><br/>This movie is typical for the season, but it has a lot of emotional moments.  Like, the girls admiring another family's holiday tradition or a scary hospital visit. Good thing Gordon has Iris and Rose to point him in the right direction.  They make themselves useful during tree shopping and a trip to Allie's home because they can see Allie has the qualities they need and Kimmy lacks.  This movie is an easy yet predictable watch for the whole family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
