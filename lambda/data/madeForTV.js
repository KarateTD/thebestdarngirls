    "mtitle": "Terror Comes Knocking: The Marcela Borges Story",
    "review": "Marcela and Ruben Borges watch their baby's heartbeat during their prenatal exam. After the appointment, Ruben and Marcela head toward their separate cars. Marcela will go to their son's graduation while Ruben works. Ruben promises to pick up the cake before heading home for Ryan's party.<br/><br/>Marcela and Ruben consider going to the zoo before getting a knock at the door. Ryan runs to the door and opens it. Three masked men - Victor, Miguel, and Oscar - enter with guns. They tie up the Borgeses and ransack the house. They demand Ruben's money. They put the family in their SUV and drive to another location.<br/><br/>The kidnappers bring the Borgeses to a trailer park and throw them onto the floor. Marcela begs for her family's life. Then, a masked woman, Bianca, speaks. She wants $200,000, or she will kill the Borgeses one at a time. Bianca knows everything about them and won't allow Marcela to say otherwise. She won't let Marcela's pleas, tears, or tricks distract her. Can the Borgeses survive?<br/><br/>It's unbelievable that anyone could survive this situation. The script puts the audience in a sense of panic. It allows you to see the unspoken communication between Marcela and Ruben. The Borgeses do everything to survive this nightmare. The conclusion gives the viewers each character's recap. However, the motive is missing from the script. A member of Bianca's family needs $100,000 to avoid jail time. Bianca had insight into Ruben's business finances and assumed Ruben's wealth. You will cheer for Marcela's daring decision but cringe at the recap. It lets viewers know that the world is unfair.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Fatal Social Following",
    "review": "It's been a year since Julia attended school. Her friend, Nina, disappeared after she and Julia walked to the woods. The police cleared Julia of any wrongdoing, but the town labeled Julia a murderer. Julia promises her parents, Melissa and Paul, that she will focus on her studies and the track team.<br/><br/>Julia arrives at school, and Brittany bullies her. Adam steps in to help, but Brittany turns her venom towards him. Julia gets an app notification that 'The Family' wants to follow her social media account during class. Julia approves the connection, and her teacher, Maria Delgado, catches Julia on her phone. Maria admonishes the behavior but offers Julia a shoulder to cry on.<br/><br/>Later, The Family asks Julia if she feels alone and scared. Julia confirms her hidden pain, and The Family says their group helped. Julia agrees to join The Family but must complete tasks to prove her loyalty. Julia falls behind in school while trying to recall what happened the night Nina disappeared and to please her new family. Can Julia come out of this unscathed and clear her name?<br/><br/>This movie moves in too many directions and concludes with the most absurd. Julia doesn't act like a person who lost their best friend. Adam is the only character who makes sensible decisions. The plot attempts to make a statement, but this is the wrong audience. Viewers can skip this confusing film during LMN's 2025 Deadly Resolutions programming.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Jane Mysteries: A Deadly Prescription",
    "review": "Detective John congratulates Jane for finishing her set. John sits with the band while Jane joins her aunt Sadie at a table. Sadie sees the romance between Jane and John building and encourages Jane to go after him. Then a woman, Sandra, runs into the club, hugs John, and leaves with him. Jane tries to follow but John and Sandra drive away too fast.<br/><br/>Jane looks over her uncle Herald's old case files. Then, John enters with Sandra. Sandra explains that her son, Ryan, has an appeal approaching. Years ago, Sandra was ill and couldn't afford her medicine. So, Ryan robbed their local pharmacy at gunpoint. The pharmacist, Phyllis, died but Ryan says he didn't shoot her. Sandra never believed Ryan did this. Someone confirmed her belief when they broke into her home and left a note. The note states, 'I know your son is innocent. I'm sorry.' Jane remembers the case file in Herald's boxes. Sadie confirms it was the last case he worked on. Jane promises to continue investigating.<br/><br/>Jane and John read Herald's notes. They uncovered that three people were in the store during the shooting. Phyllis's husband, pharmacist Jason, ran when he heard his wife scream for help. Pharmacist Kyle worked in the backroom during the murder but never saw Ryan. Joe stocked the shelves during the shooting but didn't hear anything because he wore headphones. Jane believes that Jason, Kyle, or Joe can prove Ryan's innocence and lead her to the actual murderer.<br/><br/>This film, based on Amateur Night: A Jane Da Silva Mystery by K. K. Beck, has insurance fraud, a falling air conditioner, and three new songs. Jane finishes Herald's last case while balancing personal issues. First, Sadie still hurts from her husband's passing. Jane wants her to go out, have fun, and find like-minded people. Second is Jane's relationship with John. It's a delicate situation that's complicated with police corruption. As John and Jane find their footing, they unravel a fun mystery with the audience. And let's not forget the many layers of Sadie. She fires a gun, understands ballistics, and gives an award-winning performance. This film is a musical watch for any sleuthing Hallmarkie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Vanished in Death Valley",
    "review": "Kayla and Alan, a married couple, ride through Death Valley with their daughter, Hope. Kayla wants to bond while seeing the sights, but Hope is less enthusiastic. Kayla sees signs for an antique shop. She wants to stop, but Alan wants to drive. She convinces them to use the shopping to connect. However, Kayla worries the car could overheat later. So, she asks Alan to take it to a local mechanic to check its fluids.<br/><br/>Kayla and Hope walk around the antique shop. They argue over a Death Valley shot glass because Kayla won't buy it. After Kayla leaves, the manager, Lydia, gives Hope the shot glass. Lydia states that Kayla will regret her harsh words later and commends Hope for being an intelligent young lady.<br/><br/>Kayla and Hope meet with Alan after the mechanic, Eli, checks out their car. They drive down the road until the car overheats. Hope exits the car and asks to turn on the air conditioner. They give Hope permission to walk to the store and rest until they fix the car.<br/><br/>Hope walks down the road, and Eli gets her attention from his vehicle. Hope senses something is off and rips off her bracelet. She runs towards the store, but Eli grabs her and pulls her into his car. Later, Alan and Kayla arrive at the store but can't find Hope. Kayla knows something's wrong when she discovers Hope's favorite bracelet on the ground. Years ago, Lydia and Eli lost their daughter, Dani. Now, Lydia convinced Eli to kidnap Hope to replace Dani. Can Kayla and Alan find Hope before she disappears with Eli and Lydia?<br/><br/>This movie has the right amount of crazy that Lifetimers beg for. Lydia is unhinged, and Eli goes with it. At first, he tries to be the voice of reason but descends into Lydia's madness. The script lets you listen to Lydia's insane reasoning for kidnapping Hope. Alan and Kayla have issues too. These issues cause them to bicker during the search. However, Kayla won't let anyone sway her. This film has two determined mothers who will fight to the death for Hope. The script occasionally lags, but the wild story makes up for it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
