    "review":"Lydia looks for a new apartment to leave her obsessive, alcoholic boyfriend Tim for good.  Before a potential landlord can sign the lease, Tim shows up and ruins the deal.  Lydia turns Tim down again and keeps looking for a new place.  She walks into a building and sees Drew fixing a light.  He offers an apartment with smart controls.  Drew leaves and Lydia gets settled in her new place.  Lydia juggles a job while going to school.  So when she gets a leak in her apartment, Drew is already there to fix it.  After fixing the leak, she offers him a drink. She has no idea how Drew could be so perfect for her.  But he has an ace up his sleeve.  He set up cameras in her apartment and watches her all the time.   As long as she is nice, he will be a dream.  But Lydia pumps the breaks when he goes too far, causing him to become a nightmare.<br/><br/>This movie does shine a light on Scotophobia and its causes but the plotline is a bit overdone.  Now, the best aspect of this film is that Lydia has an idea of what's wrong with Drew.  She can see he is coming unhinged and puts an end to the relationship.  She doesn't make excuses or blames herself, she tells him to leave and immediately puts up boundaries.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Fame at a Deadly Cost",
    "review":"Blake is a smart girl whose intelligence is only appreciated by her boyfriend Mason.  Everyone else at school calls her a nerd.  She records herself singing and playing her guitar.  She sends the video to Mason.  As she sits with her mom, her phone's notifications come in quicker than a jackrabbit in heat.  She clicks on the link and sees the video of her singing.  And it has gone viral.  At school, she confronts Mason.  He admits to posting the video.  He wanted the school to see her talent.  Mason isn't the only person who takes notice.  Rachel, a talent agent, saw the video and wants to sign Blake. Blake begs Michelle to give her a chance and she agrees.  Blake starts going to parties, getting a fake ID, and meeting producers.  One, in particular, is D.C. Conway.  D.C. has written hit songs for several artists and thinks Blake will be the next big thing.  While she is recording, Blake starts to cut off her friends and family.  Next, D.C. asks her to get a passport. Before Michelle returns home, someone breaks into their home.  They don't notice Blake's passport was the only thing stolen.  D.C. convinces Blake to leave home and record a record in Mexico.  After she leaves, Michelle learns about the dark side of D.C. and his Mexican villa.  With a text message, a reporter, a kind stranger, and a near-death experience, Michelle will do anything to get her daughter back.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for the music.  Blake's singing and playing are not dubbed nor lip-synced.  The actress puts her heart and soul into each song. You will be dancing in your seat or feeling deep compassion for human trafficking victims.  While the plot feels like something from Surviving R. Kelly, it's the music that will stick with you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lilly and her boyfriend fought off her stalker.  While her boyfriend died, she was able to push her stalker, Spencer out of a window.  But not before he cut her face.  Six months later, Lilly has a noticeable scar and goes by the name Stella.  At her plastic surgery appointment, she wows Dr. Michael Marlon and is P.A. Joyce with her knowledge of surgical procedures.  After her surgery to fix her Hypertrophic scar, Stella is asked to fill in for Joyce. Stella is happy to take the job.  At first, everything is going great.  However, Stella is having an affair, is labeled a pill popper, and causes strife in the office.  While the office is suspicious of her, she's worried Spencer is back and coming after everyone she cares about at work.<br/><br/>With such a short timeframe between Lilly becoming Stella, its obvious who Spencer is and is not.  This fact offers little to no suspense in this film.  Now, the way Stella a.k.a. Lilly gets into Spenser's mind to save the day is thought-provoking.  The last 15 minutes will grab your attention.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Secret Millionaire",
    "review":"Sean Peyton's father, William has given him an ultimatum.  Sean must get and keep a job for one week or he will be forced to work for his father's company.  The thought of working in real estate is mind-numbing to Sean.  But if he doesn't do it, his father will cut him off.  So he heads to his car and unlocks it.  He sees a young woman jump from behind his car.  She assumes he is a valet and tells him to get down.  Allison is a law student, an activist, and works part-time in a food truck called C’est si Bon.  She was papering cars with flyers to save the Fountain Green Park.  The Peyton Real Estate company wants to bulldoze the park for a strip mall.  Sean keeps up the ruse and helps Allison escape the country club. She worries he will get fired because of her stunt.  So she offers him a job as a sous chef on the food truck.  As he spends time with her, Sean starts to fall for her and she for him.  But when the truth of his lineage comes out, will she stay with him?<br/><br/>While this ending is predictable, the story arc of the character's growth is a good watch.  Seeing that Sean has a connection to the park drives his need to save it while proving himself to his father.  Allison also learns to forgive.  In a world of activism, its easy to focus on black and white, Sean helps her see the gray.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Leigh writes a blog for the Richard Records called the Bad Date Chronicles.   People, mostly women, tell her about their bad dates and she writes about them with colorful commentary.  Their boss and editor, Allison believes they are ready to expand but nothing too flowery.  Leigh leaves work early to head on a date with Conner. After a date that almost left the roof on fire, Leigh writes about it for her blog.  Conner reads the article and is dumbfounded by Leigh's side of the story.  So he writes a rebuttal telling his side.  Allison sees the readership skyrocket.  When she discovers Conner works for her long time rival and Peterson Post Editor, Milo, she sets up a meeting.  Allison sits with Milo and they come up with an idea.  They will have Conner and Leigh go out on 3 dates.  Whichever writer attracts the most readers, the editor will win $2. However, as Allison and Milo ramp up the stakes, Conner and Leigh's dates get crazier.  It will take a rumor and a post to ruin 3 relationships.<br/><br/>This movie is as funny as it is eye-opening.  Just because someone has a different perspective, it doesn't make them wrong.  On the first date, Leigh thought he skipped out on her and left her with the bill.  However, Conner got locked in the bathroom and couldn't call for help.  On the second date, Conner thought Leigh was uninterested because she was paying attention to her phone.  However, she was being set up by her boss. This is a movie you will fall in love with and laugh with over and over again.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
