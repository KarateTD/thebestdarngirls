    "review":"Jessie drives the scenic route through Yellowstone to entertain her daughter, Michelle, but Michelle holds too much resentment to care.  Michelle wants to stay in LA with her father and friends, but Jessie says no and drives.  They stop for gas, and Jessie gives Michelle money to get something to eat from the diner.  Before Michelle leaves, Jessie warns Michelle to keep a low profile.<br/><br/>Michelle orders food while waiting in a booth and watches a news ticker scroll across the TV screen.  The ticker states a woman is missing and reports a bear attack.  A ranger tells Michelle not to worry about the bear.  Michelle turns to see a uniformed Nolan with a big smile.  Soon their car breaks down.  Michelle and Jessie check their phones and can't find a signal.  After Michelle refuses to walk back to the diner, Jessie pulls out a map and sees an auto repair shop within a mile.  Michelle gets in the car, locks the doors, and puts her earbuds in her ears to ignore Jessie's pleas to open the door.  Jessie decides to leave Michelle in the car and walk alone.<br/><br/>Jessie finds Grant repairing a car at the autobody shop and asks for help.  Grant drives Jessie to her vehicle, but Michelle is gone, and the door is open.  Grant gets on his radio and calls the police.  When Sergeant Darryl comes, Jessie lies and says Michelle probably wandered off.  However, Darryl runs her name and sees Jessie is wanted for questioning about kidnapping Michelle.  Darryl puts Jessie in handcuffs and drives back to his station house.<br/><br/>As Darryl and Jessie argue, a deer runs in front of Darryl's car, and he crashes.  Grant pulls a handcuffed Jessie out and decides to help.  Their mission will put them in the path of a generational killer on a rampage.<br/><br/>Do you have your Lifetime bingo card ready? You will check all the boxes because this movie has a bratty teen, abusive husband, dumb cop, shirtless guy, and an indulgent parent.  While watching this movie, you only feel bad for the good Samaritan.  He dies trying to help a naive Jessie get back to Michelle.  Everyone else quickly loses your sympathy.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hallie can't relax after her baby, Ava, survived a heart transplant.  She takes medication to help her anxiety.  But her husband, James, reminds Hallie that if she doesn't take it, she will hallucinate and suffer from paranoia.  Hallie is getting back into her art but has a new perspective on painting.  James comes home early from a business trip and updates Hallie on his mom, Lynne.  Lynne broke up with her abusive boyfriend, Joe, and wants to be a part of the family again. However, Hallie is not too keen on Lynne helping around the house because they have a nanny, Mary.  James reminds Hallie that she needs more time to work, so more help is essential.  Before Hallie can agree, Lynne shows up at their front door.  To get away from Lynne, Hallie takes Ava to a coffee shop.  Hallie orders tea and searches for her wallet but can't find it.  A woman, Megan, comes to the table and offers to pay because she is a fan of Hallie's work.<br/><br/>Hallie leaves the coffee shop and pushes Ava home in a stroller, but Hallie frantically picks up the pace when she sees a man in a hoodie following her.  When she tells James, he runs outside to find no one there.  Sadly, James has to leave in Hallie's time of need for work.  He reminds Hallie that she has Mary and Lynne's support if needed.<br/><br/>Mary takes Ava to the park for fresh air and allows Hallie to show Megan her latest paintings.  Megan notices a red slash on Hallie's self-portrait.  Megan thinks it's bold, but Hallie says she didn't do it.  Then, Hallie gets a call from James that Mary is hurt.  Hallie runs to the park to find a sheet over Mary and Lynne holding Ava.  Hallie takes her baby home and notices something is wrong with her pills. With a messy intruder, a phantom stalker, and missing pills: is Hallie losing her mind, or is someone pushing her over the edge?<br/><br/>First, the title of this movie is misleading.  No one stole Ava at any point in this movie, but someone misplaces the baby multiple times.  Second, casting actors in classic roles to throw viewers off isn't an affective red herring anymore.  Also, it's not a far leap to figure out why the person keeps coming after Ava. but you have to watch it from the beginning for the hint.  Keep this on your DVR for a lazy afternoon at home.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
