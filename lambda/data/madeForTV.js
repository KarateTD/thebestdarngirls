   "review":"After blogging and writing puff pieces for years, Charity's boss, Janet, gives Charity her first investigative reporting piece.  Janet wants to know more about Erik Gallagher.  He is the CEO and founder of the Never Stop Believing Charity.  Twelve days before Christmas, Erik gives millions of dollars in gifts to needy people and host free events, but he doesn't solicit or receive funding.  Janet wants Charity to get close to him and follow the money.  Charity meets Erik at an ice skating rink, but she takes it slow. At the next meet-up, Charity notices a letter from Kris. In the letter, Kris thinks Erik for all his hard work and tells him to burn the letter.  Charity secretly takes a picture of it and finds out about his past.  She learns Erik was put into foster care and he never looked for his parents.  At a young age, he becomes a confectioner's apprentice and remained friends with him to this day.  Charity decides to call the confectioner, Frank, and asks him some probing questions.  The interview went well, but when Charity plays the interview back on her recorder, something distorts the tape.  The next day, Janet asks Charity for updates.  Charity tries to show Janet the picture of Kris's letter, but the image is a blank sheet of paper. Dumbfounded, Charity doesn't have anything to expose in her exposé.  That is, until her best friend and researcher, Tish, calls.  Tish found Erik's birth parents, and she has an idea of who funds the foundation.  Charity knows this information will sell the article, but she promised to keep Erik's parents out of it.  When Janet finds out, will Charity pick the job or the guy?<br/><br/>This movie is all about Christmas magic from beginning to end.  With a slip of paper thrown into a fire, Christmas wishes come true. It's not until Charity receives a Rachel the Reporter doll that she starts to attempt to believe.  And to bring a tear to your eye, the writers added a Marine's homecoming.  Whether it's a deleted image, recordings filled with static, or a long lost letter, this movie, while predictable, will have you writing a wish of your own.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Courtney runs the Skate Oval rink in her town square and puts together the Christmas Festival every year. But when Mayor Greenwood calls her into his office, she worries.  Courtney's roommate and Greenwood's receptionist, Beth, tells Courtney to relax about the meeting and lets Courtney into Greenwood's office.  On her way, Courtney runs into Noah, a retired hockey player. Greenwood reports the city doesn't have the money to support the Skate Oval nor the Christmas Festival.  Noah's skating complex will replace the Skate Oval. She wants to know what she has to do to keep the rink open and the festival going, and Mayor Greenwood's response is for her to get a Christmas miracle.  She takes a tour of Noah's Skating complex, and she knows she can't compete.  With her head hanging down, she starts to leave but hears a familiar voice calling her name.  It's Noah.  He had no idea his complex would cause the closure of the Oval.  His daughter, Grace, met Courtney a few days ago.  Grace wants to go back to the Oval and get lessons from Courtney.  She tells Noah about her dilemma, and he offers her a job at his complex.  While the job would be great, her first concern is the community.  So, Courtney sits with Beth, and they brainstorm an action plan.  First, they will write a business plan and come up with ideas to make the rink profitable.  Second, they will ask local businesses for donations to fund the Christmas festival.  Third, they will start a Christmas Card campaign. Fourth, Beth will get the city's budget to see if the council can reallocate funds.  Finally, Beth will see if Mayor Greenwood has a soft spot they can leverage.  As Courtney works on her plan, she gets closer to Noah and Grace. Courtney doesn't see the answer is under her nose and on her rink.<br/><br/>With a Hallmark beginning, it's the ending that will have you misty-eyed.  Without giving things away, you must pay attention to the clues in the story.  This movie drops subtle hints about the solution that comes together for a beautiful tribute while giving attention to a worthwhile cause, and it's a standout kick-off to the 'It's a Wonderful Lifetime' series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Who is Killing the Cheerleaders?",
    "review":"After ten years away, Ellie returns to her old high school.  Returning will bring on more anxiety for her than most because it's the scene of a horrific killing spree. Ellie's mother and a cancer patient, Linda, worries returning will trigger Ellie's PTSD and do more harm than good, but Ellie decides to face the problem head-on.  When Ellie steps on school grounds, the whispers start. The teachers act as immaturely as the students, but one teacher sparks a conversation.  Ellie's former classmate, Lisbeth, teaches at the school and remembers the murders.  She remembers the killer murdered Ellie's cheerleading friends, Kat, Val, Maggie, Abigail, and Belle, but Dana is missing.  So, Lisbeth catches Ellie up on everything that happened since she left.  Forrest, Kat's old boyfriend, is a teacher at the school and married Kat's twin sister, Brooke. Ellie is happy to have a friendly face, but she wants to do more for the school.  So, she decides to become the cheer coach.  On the field, Ellie meets the less-than-enthusiastic cheerleading team of four girls, Chloe, Pippa, Brittany, and Ava. She tells the girls their party is over, and the hard work begins.  After school, Ellie joins Linda in oncology during chemotherapy and meets her oncologist, Dr. Jonathan.  Ellie remembers Jonathan from school; he was the school photographer.  The next morning, Ellie can't find her phone, and someone misplaced her things.  Ellie shakes off the feeling and heads to school, but the horror follows her.  Someone hung Brittany up, like the killer's first victim, and wrote, 'I'm back', in pig's blood on her uniform. Lisbeth tries to convince Ellie this is a sick prank because Brittany is still alive.  But Ellie knows the truth, the killer is back, and she is in danger.<br/><br/>Good job to LMN! They provided another watchable mystery in the Fear the Cheer series.  With three past classmates and an unstable lead, the plot cloaks the killer for a while and draws you in with a semi-copycat crime spree. Characters mention old stories of bullying in jest, while current students are too enamored with the crime.  While this reviewer tries to keep the secret, let's say if it weren't for those meddling kids, the killer would get away with it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
