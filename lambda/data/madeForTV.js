"review": "Author Melanie encourages her boyfriend, Richard, before his investor's meeting. Melanie prays he will live up to his potential. She has a book signing for her upcoming project when her friend, Candy, stops by. The two go for a walk afterward and discuss their relationships. Melanie gushes about Richard. However, Candy's marriage to Byron isn't as strong. Sadly, Byron rarely touches her.<br/><br/>Melanie returns home to overflowing trash cans, unpacked boxes, and luggage. She calls around, but no one knows Richard's location. Melanie confronts Richard, and he belittles and rages at her. She tells him to leave.<br/><br/>Candy goes over Monica's business documents. Dr. Monica is a dermatologist with a thriving skin care line. Candy, Monica, and Melanie were best friends at Spelman College. However, that ended when Monica got married. After the relationship ended, Monica and Melanie didn't speak to each other. With Melanie back in town, Candy secretly invites them both to lunch. The forced reunion starts bumpy but smooths out. The three become friends again and spend a day at the spa.<br/><br/>Months later, Monica returns from a month-long business trip. Before she left, she spoke highly of her new boyfriend, Mr. C. She promised to update them upon her return. Melanie and Candy wave to Monica as the DJ introduces her. Then, Richard enters and kisses Monica. She invites Monica for milkshakes the next day and explains Richard's wrongdoings. Monica accuses Melanie of being petty and jealous. Melanie warns Monica that if Richard wasn't man enough for her, he won't be for Monica. The women have no idea how low Richard will go.<br/><br/>Based on Toni Braxton's iconic song, this film cautions against falling in love with an entitled man who serves only potential. The script balances humor with romance as the women conspire to take Richard down. Don't worry about viewing this with your partner. The script introduces two wonderful men. Melanie's neighbor, Greg, comes to her defense and puzzles. Byron is a wonderful husband, but his secret makes him feel unmanly. This film isn't about hating men. It's about them reclaiming their friendship with each other. This movie will make you laugh out loud and clutch your pearls. So sit back, relax, and enjoy.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Whispers of a Secret Life",
"review": "Business partners, Amanda and Jess, celebrate 17 years of friendship and exchange gifts. Amanda gives Jess a company-branded jacket, and Jess hands Amanda a packet; inside the packet are flyers for a seminar named Harvest. Amanda isn't sure about the lessons, but Jess begs Amanda to attend one session.<br/><br/>They arrive and meet the instructor, Faye. The material, motivation, and promises enamor Jess, but Amanda isn't as enthusiastic. Amanda wants to stop, but Jess begs her to take another class. Jess arrives the next day, but Amanda isn't there. She scrambles around the building and finds Amanda on the ground, unconscious.<br/><br/>The doctor checks Amanda. She has a concussion and an old hairline fracture. Amanda doesn't remember what caused the fracture and has a splitting headache. Jess breathes a sigh of relief because Amanda is safe. However, the relief is short-lived. Amanda's behavior becomes erratic, hostile, and violent. Jess fears for her friend. Can Jess help Amanda before it's too late?<br/><br/>As one viewer said, this movie does a lot and nothing at the same time. The writers attempt to keep Amanda's secret life quiet until the big reveal at the end. However, this tactic leaves the audience in a state of confusion. This film is background noise with a few moments of excitement.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "A Loud House Christmas Movie: Naughty or Nice",
"review": "Elf Duncan rides high after creating an automated Naughty or Nice list called TINSIL. Then, the program blinks frantically. Santa sees this and asks Duncan to investigate the issues. Duncan looks at the code and sees they have a flipper. A flipper is a kid who jumps back and forth on the lists. Santa tells Duncan to give him the kid's information. His name is Lincoln Loud. Santa demands a man on the ground to confirm Lincoln's behavior. Elf Jerrold looks through the list and finds one Elf available. It's Duncan.<br/><br/>Clyde films Lincoln's requests for Santa on a VHS tape. The Loud family and Clyde travel to the Gingerhausen fair with plans of selfies, Santa, and Krampus. Duncan unwillingly follows the family and tracks Lincoln. Soon, Lincoln gets a feeling that someone is following him. By chance, they discover Duncan, who accidentally reveals he's an elf and Lincoln's position on the list. Lincoln tries to convince Duncan that he's nice, but makes the situation worse. Duncan disappears but leaves his tablet behind.<br/><br/>Lincoln does nice things around he house for his siblings, but his name is still on the naughty list. He's tired of being good, so he uses Lisa's robot to hack the list. Hours later, the Loud family wakes up to enjoy the holiday. Instead, everyone got coal but him. The Naughties of the world got gifts while the Nice got a lump. Lincoln tells his family the truth when their father, Lynn Sr., loses his business. The Loud Family vows to save Christmas. Can they?<br/><br/>The latest Loud Family movie teaches about the actual meaning of nice. Lincoln fakes a caring attitude when he's on the naughty list, but everything he does is self-serving. Children and tweens watch performative acts of kindness on social media. It's good for them to learn that giving from the heart is at the forefront of being nice. One Loud Sibling has character growth that no one will see coming. The animation is rough by today's standards, but it returns to a simpler time. This film is a magical watch for kids and parents this holiday season. It has something for everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Tidings for the Season",
"review": "Lucy begs her son, Robbie, to get ready for school. He's captivated by the local news anchor, Adam. It's Robbie's dream to anchor the news one day. Today, Robbie will be one step closer when his 5th-grade class attends a field trip to the news station.<br/><br/>Adam tapes a few segments while his producer, Todd, delivers cues. Todd asks Adam to help with the field trip, but Adam wants to focus on his tapings. Todd walks the kids to the control room, while Robbie slips away and sits at the anchor desk. To the crew's delight, Robbie interviews Adam. After the kids leave, Adam finds Robbie's binder under his desk with a return note inside. Todd suggests Adam hand-deliver it and offer Robbie a week-long intership.<br/><br/>Adam brings the binder to a star-struck Robbie and offers him the job. Lucy tells Robbie to wait inside so the grown-ups can talk. She turns down Adam's offer, but Robbie convinces her to say yes because it's what he wants for Christmas. Lucy caves. Adam doesn't know that this week will change his life personally and professionally. Will that disappear when a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity comes his way?<br/><br/>The cute kid makes this film. Robbie is kind, outspoken, and determined. This story puts pressure on the male lead to change his career focus for love. Lucy must change her perspective on asking for help. She is altruistic but fearful of being let down. These feelings are usually attributed to one character while the other is the healer. However, they help each other see the brighter path. This film is compelling and touching. It's worth adding to your holiday slate.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

"mtitle": "Eric Jerome Dickey's Friends and Lovers",
"review": "Part 1.<br/><br/>Flight attendant Shelby enters her best friend's bed to commiserate about their dating life. Shelby returned home to find her boyfriend, Bryce, starting his latest career as a DJ with a house full of people. Shelby's friend, O B GYN Debra, isn't having the best luck either. Her ex-fiancé, James, came to her clinic with his new pregnant wife. Debra doesn't want to give up on love and hires a matchmaking service to help. However, Shelby decides to be celibate.<br/><br/>Comedian Leonard finishes his set but gets heckled by his drunk ex-girlfriend. He meets with his friend, Tyrel, who shares his troubles with women. Leonard laughs because Tyrel dates unavailable women. They admit they have to make a change if they want to find the woman for them.<br/><br/>Debra goes to a car wash, but the tap-to-pay feature doesn't work. Leonard gets out of his car and pays for her wash. They flirt and exchange numbers. Debra leaves with a smile, while Leonard calls Tyrel to borrow money so he doesn't overdraw his account with Debra's car wash.<br/><br/>Debra arrives at the comedy show with Shelby. Shelby excuses herself for the bathroom and has an awkward encounter with Tyrel. They enjoy Leonard's set and meet afterward. Debra and Leonard trick Shelby and Tyrel into spending the evening together. After tonight, two sets of friends will become a pair of lovers. Will both relationships last?<br/><br/>Part 2.<br/><br/>Leonard's TV show is a hit, and he has become a household name. He and Debra shop for a new home. The realtor leaves them alone, and they make love. Debra hates that she gave in to temptation, but her mood changes when Leonard gets down on one knee. Their relationship turns grim when they are unable to conceive a child. Debra worries their marriage won't weather this storm.<br/><br/>Shelby and Tyrel's relationship has its challenges. Tyrel bought an engagement ring to prove it. Shelby's proof is the baby inside of her. A baby that she's not sure she wants. She calls Debra for a ride to the clinic when an old girlfriend of Tyrel sees her there and alerts him. He confronts Shelby about terminating the pregnancy, and she ends the relationship. Debra and Leonard pray they can work it out. Will their prayers be answered?<br/><br/>Review of Part 1 and Part 2.<br/><br/>Based on Friends and Lovers by Eric Jerome Dickey, these films explore the dynamics of friendship and romantic relationships. Part one gives the audience a chance to know the characters' situations, bonds, and dreams, even if they are unattainable. Part two shows the audience the aftermath of their decisions. However, the second part passed too fast. While part one covered a month or two, the second part covered years. The heartbreak this film delivers is a testament to its character development. You must watch both parts of this picture to appreciate the storytelling and raw emotions.<br/><br/>Part 1 is 4.5 out of 5 stars and Part 2 is 4 out of 5 stars.",
