        "review":"Catherine's script is rejected again.  India, Catherin's daughter, business is failing.  India is lost and doesn't know what to do next.  Catherine was told about an Executive Success Program by a friend.  She believes it will help her and India grow in business and get out of their slump.  Plus, they can do it together.  After the first seminar, Catherine and India sign up for more in Albany.  Catherine witnesses some disturbing trends in the house and wants to leave, India wants to stay.  Catherine doesn't know she is leaving India with a sex cult called NXIVM.  It will take public pleas and a news article to free India from their charismatic leader Keith.<br/><br/>From the outside looking in, you can see the 4 pillars of indoctrination.  Picking a target, love bombing, isolation, and control is how all cults find and keep their members.  The branding scene may be disturbing to younger viewers but this is a great teaching tool.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"Amy attends her father's book festival to get her mind off her recent office break-in.  Later that night, she is doing great until Travis spots a man sitting outside Graham's.  Travis checks the man out and discovers the man is dead.  Shake but not deterred, Graham continues with the festival.  But Graham will end the night in handcuff when he is suspected of killing Betsy.  At one time, Betsy had the number one author because she stole Graham's first manuscript and gave it to another author.  The author is not longer successful but Graham still held resentment.  If Amy and Travis don't help him, he could be serving a life sentence.<br/><br/>While there are plenty of good suspects and a strong plotline, the killer is an easy choice for long-time Hallmark fans.  So watch this movie for how the killer committed the crime, not the killer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

Autumn and Megan make the team but Megan is given 1 week to lose 5 pounds to stay on the team.  Autumn has her first story.  However, when her stories cause physical pain, mental torment, and death, Autumn wants to find the killer.<br/><br/>This is a Lifetime movie that follows Hallmark's guide to mystery writing.  And it is done with great precision.  You are given plenty of viable suspects, clues, and misdirects.  This movie should become a Lifetime movie series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
