    "mtitle": "Not My Family: The Monique Smith Story",
    "review": "Monique returns home from work, and her mother, Elizabeth, takes her money. Monique begs for the cash because she needs to pay graduation expenses. Elizabeth refuses and beats her. Monique can't take the beatings anymore. She waits for Elizabeth to leave and searches Elizabeth's room. She finds her social security card, birth certificate, and cash. Then, Monique gets on the first bus out of town. She thinks it will be the first step in her new life. Unfortunately, she lands in the home of a pimp, Caroline.<br/><br/>During her exploitation, Monique finds love. She escapes Caroline, gets married, and gets pregnant. This happily-ever-after doesn't last. Monique leaves her husband and returns to Elizabeth's home. Elizabeth continues to be cruel, but Elizabeth's mother, Sarah, gives Monique unconditional love.<br/><br/>Later, Monique gives birth to her first child. She goes through the documentation with the nurse and asks how to find her birth certificate. Monique goes to the municipal building, but they don't have a record of her birth or death. Monique realizes that Elizabeth's mistreatment stems from a horrific truth: Monique is not her child. Monique will search for decades to find her family, the truth, and her name.<br/><br/>Based on I Am The Ancestor: Before I Die I Must Tell My Story by S. Monique Smith, this film will trigger your rage. Monique falls into abusive situations, looking for love. She becomes prey to molesters, pimps, and abusers looking for motherly affection. It's not until she has children that Monique sees Elizabeth's evil nature. The set designers ensured fashion and technology fell within the period. And the actors will invoke your compassion and rage. However, this movie should have a trigger warning for assault survivors. Monique's trauma is the beginning of her story, not the conclusion. She triumphs, creating a new legacy and cycle for her family and future generations. This film should spark a conversation about family secrets and ignorance.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "There's No Way Out",
    "review": "Nurse Shannon overhears Dr. Doug talking about one of her patients, Briar. Briar and her older sister, Juniper, emerged from the woods before Briar collapsed. Dr. Doug tests Briar and diagnoses her with severe tuberculosis. He suspects they haven't seen a doctor in years. Both girls scream when the social worker grabs Briar, and Shannon steps in. She and her husband, Rob, finished the paperwork to become foster parents. Shannon offers to foster the girls so they can stay together.<br/><br/>Shannon tells her husband, Rob, about the two girls. Juniper and Briar are fish out of water inside Shannon and Rob's home. However, Shannon and Rob spend quality time with each girl to acclimate them to their new surroundings. Juniper settles into her new life while Briar struggles.<br/><br/>Shannon and Rob get a call from Officer Edmunds because Juniper and Briar's parents, Stephen and Holly, arrived at the station demanding their children. The social worker informs Stephen and Holly that Juniper and Briar will remain in Shannon and Rob's custody until the court hearing. Stephen warns everyone to stay out of his family business before leaving the station with Holly. Later, Holly warns Shannon that Stephen is dangerous. He will do anything to get his family under his control. Can Rob and Shannon keep Juniper and Briar safe, or will Stephen's manipulation work?<br/><br/>This movie shows how people born into indoctrination differ from those who join. Briar keeps in contact with her parents, although Shannon and Rob provide a comfortable life for her. Juniper quickly adjusts to the new life and doesn't want to leave. This dynamic causes strife in Shannon and Rob's marriage. The conclusion is flowery, but the movie is mildly compelling.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: A Lesson In Murder",
    "review": "Teacher's Assistant Aurora helps Professor Lindo present the next assignment to their students. They need to write a paper on a poison used in a crime and how the police discovered it.

Then, Aurora overhears a conversation between Kevin and Kevin's girlfriend, Jenny. Jenny's ex-boyfriend, Owen, is following her.<br/><br/>Aurora ends the day in Professor Lindo's office when Lindo's former assistant, Cal, interrupts. He wants a letter of recommendation from Lindo, but she refuses. Cal gave students better grades, so Lindo fired him. Lindo got the tip for Kevin after several baseball players passed.<br/><br/>Aurora discovers her mother, Aida, got a job on campus. Professor Lindo and Aurora walk Aida around and catch Kevin and Tanner fighting. Tanner is furious because Kevin got his spot on the team.

Kevin's smoothie had sodium nitrate, a highly toxic substance. It confirms that someone poisoned and murdered Kevin. Detective Cook and Arthur examine the security footage and see four people handling Kevin's drink. Owen knocked it off the table, Cal made it, Tanner brought it to the table, and Jenny put something in it. Professor Lindo worries her 'true crime' literature course may have inspired a killer and wants to end the lecture. Aurora doesn't think Professor Lindo is to blame and wants to prove it by finding the culprit. Can Aurora unmask a killer?<br/><br/>Inspired by the Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, this installment has a fun chase, several suspects, and a twist you won't see coming. The college years add a new layer to a beloved character while allowing long-time fans to laugh at jokes about Aurora's future. The writer's love for the genre shines with two book mentions: Die, My Love, and Bitter Harvest. This second installment of the college years will make you fall in love with the series again. This film is more than a must-see. It's a guaranteed rewatch.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sinister Surgeon",
    "review": "Katelyn enters P and N Plastic Surgery to start her residency. Katelyn enters a hectic scene because the office manager, Lori, is yelling at two men in the lobby. Later, Lori explains the two men are Detective Elliot and former resident Brad. Katelyn will take over Brad's job because he did subpar work. And Detective Elliot has questions for one of their doctors. Katelyn meets Dr. Nichols. She is cold, rude, and impatient with Katelyn. Then, Lori introduces Katelyn to Dr. Jacob Peterson. Jacob is gentle, friendly, and open.<br/><br/>Katelyn and Jacob flirt while they work. Lori can't believe Katelyn's resemblance to Jacob's deceased wife. She knows it's a matter of time before they start dating. One morning, Katelyn gets in her car, and Detective Elliot sits in the passenger seat. He warns Katelyn that he's investigating Jacob because someone is killing Jacob's patients. While Elliot suspects Jacob, Katelyn believes he should look into Brad. Jacob's actions make Katelyn question his innocence. So, she delves deeper into his past. Will Katelyn find an innocent man or a sinister surgeon?<br/><br/>Viewers have to give this movie a fair chance. The setup feels predictable but offers an alluring twist. And a warning to the audience: the killing scene rivals a Criminal Minds episode. They offer blood, guts, and gore. It's unclear if the medical jargon is correct, but the acting makes it believable. Katelyn solely focuses on Brad, but you won't. Experienced Lifetimers can see through the fluff and decipher the killer and why. However, the plot has more to offer. So watch this film until the end.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

However, they discover they can do more if they band together. Can Josh and Ella save their programs while falling in love?<br/><br/>This third Hearts installment follows Josh as he falls in love with Ella. While their love story should take center stage, Gina's subplot garners attention. She loves music but has difficulty focusing in class. They must have Gina's grandmother sign the papers. This trip gives Gina and Kiki bonding time. Their car conversations will heal the soul and teach the viewer how to be kind to themselves. It's these moments that save this film. The conclusion eases Hallmarkies into the fourth installment.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
