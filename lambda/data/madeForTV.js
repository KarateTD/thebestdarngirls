    "review":"Vicky is tired of her mother's disappointment.  She dropped out of high school, got a loser boyfriend, and a dead-end job.  Now, at the age of 30, Vicky wants a change.  She steals her co-worker's identity and enrolls in high school.  Vicky, now Caitlyn, will become captain of the cheer squad, date an athlete, become popular, and graduate.  What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie is what happens when someone takes the crazy train to self-help.  Blood-thirsty Lifetime fans will get a body count but a predictable story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ava and her mother move to a new town to give Ava a fresh start after a bumpy year.  Since the school doesn't have a dance team, her mother tells Ava to try out for the cheerleader team.  At first, Ava doesn't want to but goes for it when she can't make friends.  Ava makes the team but when she is in the path of the queen bee, Katrina, Ava is in for a world of hurt.<br/><br/>This is a movie to watch with your teen.  So much of this story could have been avoided if Ava had talked to her mother.  And Katrina's reign of hazing and bullying could have been stopped if adults did their job.  It doesn't matter if kids stand up to bullies when adults consistently let them down.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
