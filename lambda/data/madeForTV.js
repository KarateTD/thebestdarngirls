    "mtitle":"Secret Life of a Sorority Girl",
    "review":"Math teacher Cheryl declines a date with Principal Randall to spend the evening with her daughter, Ashley. Cheryl finds Ashley with her boyfriend, Beckett, but Ashley can't have dinner. Ashley flusters and says she will go to work at the library after changing clothes. Cheryl and Beckett stand in confusion.<br/><br/>Cheryl goes to work and sees her co-worker, Ben, recuperating from his bachelor party hangover. He apologizes and shows Cheryl an image of Ashley dancing on a pole. Cheryl immediately leaves work to confront Ashley at her sorority house. Cheryl demands an explanation. Ashley lost her scholarship after a poorly performing semester and needed money for school and sorority dues.<br/><br/>Ashley's sorority sister, Karla, runs to Cheryl's home for help. Both haven't seen or heard from Ashley for two days. So, Ashley decides to enter the belly of the beast as a rookie stripper to find Ashley. Can she do it without losing her life?<br/><br/>This film hints at issues strippers face, but it's not a call to action. It's a whodunit with pole dancing. The plot gives viewers several red herrings but nothing concrete. Cheryl challenges unruly customers, jealous dancers, and trashy boyfriends. One unforeseen alliance is the owner, Dolly. Dolly is tough but fair. She counts money first and your feelings second. The protagonist makes missteps, but mostly everyone gets a happy ending.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Also, radio host Raina will interview Meg today about the store and the club.<br/><br/>Graham meets with his manager, Terrance, to discuss Graham's new book. Terrance thinks the historical romance is okay but wants Graham to finish the 8th book of his successful series. Graham gets in his car and calls his sister, Lizzy, for guidance.

He decides to travel to Nantucket and meet her.<br/><br/>Meg drops Renee off at the B and B, but Renee won't discuss why she came to town. So, Meg returns to the store with the feeling of impending dread. Graham walks into the store, and they relate over books and marketing.

    "mtitle":"One Bad Apple: A Hannah Swensen Mystery",
    "review":"Hannah teaches Beginners Baking at the local college when English Literature Professor Bradford enters. Bradford notices some of his students are in her class. He thinks they could join forces because authors use food for imagery. After class, Hannah talks to her students, Willa and Pam, studying. Kyle, sitting at another table, shushes them. Willa introduces Hannah to her brother, Perry. Then, Bradford's teaching assistant, Tim, approaches and asks them to attend his party. Hannah says no, but her students accept.<br/><br/>Later, Hannah's mother, Delores, cancels their dinner plans but tricks Norman into escorting Hannah. Hannah arrives at the restaurant and runs into Willa, crying. Willa says she's ok and exits. During her dinner, Hannah notices Bradford talking to his ex-wife, Stacey.<br/><br/>Hannah meets with the new district attorney, Chad, to discuss Ken's embezzlement case. Hannah enters Bradford's office to discuss the first collaborative assignment. She snoops and finds failing papers, a note to meet Stacey and photos of Bradford's dog. They choose To Kill A Mockingbird's Charlotte Russe Cake. Bradford lies to end his meeting early, but Hannah is wise to his deceit.<br/><br/>Hannah and Bradford introduce the assignment to Hannah's class, but Tim calls Bradford away. Hannah watches them argue but focuses on her class. Bradford returns and explains that Tim thinks he grades too harshly. Hannah offers to teach Bradford how to make the cake, and Bradford turns on the portable stove. Hannah smells gas, pulls Bradford away, and watches fire shoot out. Newly minted Detective Lonnie arrives and alerts Hannah that the fire marshall believes the fire was intentional.<br/><br/>After conversing with her co-worker, Lisa, Hannah decides to end Bradford's flirting. She wants to do it face-to-face and goes to Bradford's office. Stunned, Hannah finds Bradford dead with the knife in his side. Later, Lonnie discovers the knife is from Hannah's set, and the students, who are suspects, will leave campus in a week for their break. With evidence pointing at her, Hannah must solve the crime before the culprit or culprits leave.<br/><br/>Based on Apple Turnover Murder by Joanne Fluke, this installment explains Mike's absence, introduces new love interests, and gives Delores a new job. Unlike other shows in the series, the plot takes a while to expose the victim. The script carefully explains your favorite's growth while introducing new regulars. This new pace has one downfall: the wrap-up. Hannah explains the who, what, where, and why in 2 minutes. This slip won't happen again because the script established the new and updated characters.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Writing a Love Song",
    "review":"Chloe brings coffee to producer Mia and their boss, Sloane. Chloe asks Sloane his opinion on her demo. Sloane didn't listen to it and doesn't think she is ready. Chloe sighs with frustration because she's worked at the studio longer than Mia, but Mia is Sloane's niece.<br/><br/>Dustin breezes into his manager's office and notes his manager's tone. Stu informs Dustin the record label doesn't want to release a new album because his record sales are abysmal compared to his last project. Later, Stu tells Dustin other studios don't want to waste time on him, but there is one that could sway. Dustin doesn't want to work there because of bad memories, but it's his only option.<br/><br/>Dustin and Stu go to the studio looking for Sloane, but Sloane isn't there. Chloe lies and says she is Sloane's apprentice. She looks at her empty calendar and states that she can only do the job before and after work. If Chloe can turn Dustin's song into a hit, she will get Sloane's respect. Otherwise, she can lose her job. And without the hit, Dustin will lose his career. Chloe thinks this will be easy, but Dustin's writer's block is more challenging than she suspected.<br/><br/>This movie flows through the natural progression of any romantic comedy. Although the storyline isn't a standout, it highlights an artist's struggle. Music doesn't magically happen. It takes hard work, dedication, and honesty. This film adds sweet melodies to a typical symphony.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
