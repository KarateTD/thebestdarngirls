    "review":"Allyson decides to use her trust fund to buy a home with her fiancé, Eric.  While his name isn't on the mortgage, he will be living with her. The realtor tells Eric the previous owner died, and there was an issue with the next of kin.  So the furniture is theirs, if they want to keep it.  Before Eric makes another statement, Allyson decides to buy the home immediately.  After Eric and Allyson leave, a man comes up to the realtor and inquires about the property.  She tells the man, Josh, that the property is off the market, but the owners will be renting the guest house.  After the couple relocates, Josh comes to the house and inquires about the rental guest home. Josh offers to pay for six months but will occupy the house for three, and he gives cash.  Eric accepts Josh's offer without calling references or checking with Allyson.  This guest will grow into a nightmare, but the couple must discover why.<br/><br/>Eric is the most inconsiderate fiancé in Lifetime's history without committing murder. Allyson would fare much better without him.  With that aside, this movie gives valuable information about tenant laws.  But it doesn't leave much room for entertainment.  This movie is background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Celeste works as a waitress and enchants Steve Beard, a widower. After a few months, he asks Celeste to move in with her daughters, Jennifer and Kristina. After moving in, Celeste gets a shock.  Steve proposes.  At the wedding, Sam's daughter, Becky, doesn't hold her tongue about Celeste.  But Celeste tells Becky to back down because Celeste signed a prenup. It's not long before a retired Steve sees his wife loves money and clothes.  When he tells her to stop spending, or he will file for divorce, she panics and threatens to attempt suicide. Steve puts Celeste in a mental institution.  It's there that she meets Tracey, a mentally unstable woman that is unlucky in love. As time goes by, Celeste tells Tracey that Steve mistreats her, but she can't leave because of the prenup. It's not long before a masked intruder walks into Steve's bedroom and shoots him in the stomach. At the hospital, Celeste tells them she doesn't know who would hurt her husband.  But Kristina thinks Tracey did it. As the police close in on Tracey, they have no idea she is a pawn in a deadly game of golden chess.<br/><br/>Based on The Fortune Hunter by Suzy Spencer, several crime shows covered this deadly lover's triangle from every angle except one.  Unlike all the other retellings, this movie gives insight into Celeste's children and their role in the saga. When the movie ends, you will see that that Celeste's depravity and greed know no bounds.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Til Death Do Us Part",
    "review":"With four days until they say, 'I do,' Aurora and Nick greet incoming guests and put the final touches on their wedding.  But Aida has to leave because someone called about a problem at one of her properties, and Aurora comes along to check it out.  At the building, Aurora and Aida see Arthur taking notes.  He tells them the construction workers found a skeleton under a slab of concrete. Aida tells him the previous owner was Bernard, a friend of Aurora's dad, Charles.  Charles's other friends, Ted and Dennis, meet at Aurora's house to welcome Nick and congratulate the couple on their upcoming nuptials.  After a few days, genetic phenotyping creates a composite sketch of the man under the slab. Aurora takes the picture to Charles, and he recognizes it as Sam Woods, an old acquaintance that left town and never spoke to them again.  Before the night is over, Arthur talks to all four men - Charles, Bernard, Dennis, and Ted - about the last time they saw Sam alive. Although Arthur becomes suspicious of the men, he has nothing to hold them on. The next day, Lydia walks to the police station and declares that she was Sam's fiancé.  She believes one of the four poker players is the culprit.  As the evidence points to Charles, Aurora won't accept that her father or his friends are killers.  She must investigate Sam's murder, but could this investigation kill her wedding?<br/><br/>Based on the novels by Charlaine Harris, this installment keeps viewers on their toes while having them worried about the wedding.  This double suspense makes this movie the most nerve-racking ever.  Since each man had bad blood with Sam before he died, it's hard to narrow it down to one suspect.  When the plot unmasks the killer, it will leave you shocked and delighted. And let's not forget about that dress.  You will watch this movie multiple times.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
