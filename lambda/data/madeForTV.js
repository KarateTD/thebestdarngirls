    "mtitle":"V.C. Andrews' Web of Dreams",
    "review":"Annie returns to Farthinggale Manor to bury her father Troy.  Although she recently discovered her real father, she feels obligated to return to the home where she was kept as a prisoner.  When she walks around the home, she gets flashes of her abusive past at the hands of her grandfather Tony.  Before she leaves, the butler hands her a diary.  The diary belonged to her grandmother Leigh.  Annie sits and reads the painful past endured by Leigh and the courage her grandmother had at such a young age.<br/><br/>Web of Dreams is a prequel for the Castel series.  This prequel may feel unnecessary or out of order to the viewer, it is told at the right time for Annie.  It gives Annie an understanding that she isn't alone in her abuse and she can overcome her trauma.  Also, this movie answers a lot of questions about what happened to Leigh and her volatile relationships.  It's best to watch the prequel last as the author intended.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
