    "review":"Wedding-planner Cadence and exterior-designer Henry are chosen to work together designing the stage for the winter elementary school performance. Henry is surprised she has plans drafted and color-coded. He prefers to go with the flow. Out of fear, she pushes him away. But when an unforeseen event ruins her customer's wedding, she leans on Henry to get it back on track.<br/><br/>With stunning designs and cute kids, this movie doesn’t make up for a lack-luster script. With the bland plotline, you don’t feel connected to the characters or their story arc. The movie is pretty to watch, it's just not enough to keep you engaged.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Carole has a wonderful husband, 2 beautiful children, a career helping the community, and a lot of bills. She worries if they can make ends meet.  Her husband started a new business without confirmed clients and her charity needs millions to stay open next year. She wonders what would've happened if she made different choices. Iris, her driver, janitor, and newscaster, will show her first hand. Which life will Carole choose?<br/><br/>Entering an alternate life to decide if you made the right choice is not a new story. It's a story told during different seasons. If someone is attempting to do this overdone plot, at least make it funny or extremely heartfelt. This script and recycled plot could not be saved by the amazing acting.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Magical Christmas Shoes",
    "review":"Following a dutch tradition, Noelle's grandmother sends her shoes filled with candy for Christmas. Each pair of shoes have a different theme with magical qualities. Over the years, each pair of shoes have fallen flat of their expectations. Her bubble gum pink shoes, meant to get her out of sticky situations, get stuck in gum. Luckily, John is there to scrape off the gum. Noelle is shocked to see that John is closing Reid's candy store. It has meant so much to her family. So she offers to look over the books to save the store. Working with John will inspire them both to go after their dreams. In the end, she will know the true magic behind the shoes.<br/><br/>Adding shoes to the Christmas mix is not new, but adding the Dutch tradition is a change of pace. It's interesting that Noelle blames all bad things on the shoes but when good things happen she says she doesn't believe in magic. It's a weird contradiction of power. This movie is fun but not a classic.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Kelsey wakes up in a hospital with no memory of her husband Jason. The doctor assures her that memory loss can happen after a car accident. Jason says they eloped and got married. They were on their way to their honeymoon when they crashed. Since the honeymoon was in a stress-free, noise-free, tech-free environment, Jason believes it would be better to recuperate there. To ease her, they get separate rooms. Kelsey is fine until she gets flashes of a different side of John. Who is he really?<br/><br/>A slow build to a W.T.F. moment. As a viewer, you know something is off about Jason. You just don’t know how the two know each other and what really happened. Lifetime viewers will be surprised to find out who Jason really is.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
