    "review":"Zoe's boss, Harris, has a new assignment for her. He wants her to create a new book for Yosemite, and Harris will make it a series if the book does well. Zoe takes on the project because she will get more books in the future. Harris gives Zoe a few weeks to take 100 or more photos with a blurb for some.<br/><br/>Zoe comes to the ranger station and asks Ranger Sage if any of them do a guided tour. Sage points out some of the most-liked trails, but Zoe wants something off the beaten path. Sage's grandfather, Cos, knows a naturalist, Jack, who understands the ecosystem and the landscapes. Through Cos, Zoe finds Jack at his remote cabin. He is willing to work with Zoe, but she will have to wait until next week. Zoe refuses because she needs her pictures soon, so she leaves. Sage tells Zoe about a day trail but warns Zoe it can get slippery.<br/><br/>Zoe gets some great images but slips on a rock and gets stuck. Jack hears Zoe's panicked cries, shoos the bear away, and pulls Zoe's foot out of the rock formation. Worried, Sage told Jack that Zoe was going on a trail and might need help. Zoe could be a danger to herself, so Jack offers to help her immediately. This relationship of convenience develops into natural love.<br/><br/>The beauty of Yosemite shines through effortlessly as the writers pay homage to the dark but honest history of the national park. Acknowledging this history allows viewers to appreciate the Half Dome and the romance. The romance takes a back seat to Zoe's goal, but it lets the romance develop believably. And the chemistry between Zoe and Jack is undeniable.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sophie reassures her best friend, Emma, that no one believes the rumors about Emma on Carolyn's website, Living Hell. Sophie walks into her mother's classroom and tells Grace about the website. Grace has a parent-teacher conference with Carolyn's mom, Paula, and promises to get to the bottom of it. Paula says she doesn't believe Carolyn bullies other kids, but she will talk to her daughter about the website.<br/><br/>A few days later, Principal Dugger calls Carolyn and Sophie into his office. Both students were up for the Wilson scholarship, but Sophie won 1st place with $250,000 to any school. Carolyn rages that it is hers and believes Grace rigged the scholarship.<br/><br/>Carolyn confronts Sophie and tells her to give up the prize. Sophie explains she needs the money to pay for college. Then, Sophie gives Carolyn a dismissive eye roll and leaves. Carolyn vow to make Sophie give her the scholarship, or Carolyn will ruin Sophie.<br/><br/>Don't let the title fool you. This movie is about the first class of the day, not the airlines. In this school, there are so many failures to act that it will make your head spin. First, teens have way too much time on their hands. Second, a mother's love knows no bounds. A mother will do anything for their child, including using a shovel. Yes, Lifetimers. You will get a shovel to the face. This movie is as entertaining as it is infuriating. Also, it provides a fun mystery with plenty of suspects.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rosy meets with her best friend, Mel, for a celebratory coffee. Rosy opened up her stylist boutique with the inheritance her grandmother, Aida, left her. Rosy will have a grand opening in a few days, but she needs to iron out some more details.<br/><br/>While Rosy plans her party, Val, the editor of Chicago Trend Magazine, walks into Rosy's boutique. Val wants to do a mini-feature on the boutique, so Rosy needs to finish her website. Before the new site goes live, Rosy needs new professional pictures. Mel has a cousin, Jaxon, who is a professional photographer.<br/><br/>Rosy meets Jaxon, and he takes a few test shots of her and says no. Annoyed, Rosy leaves Jaxon. Afterward, Jaxon gets a call from his agent, Chase. If Jaxon can get some candid, fun-loving shots, Jaxon could get a job with World Traveler Magazine. Jaxon calls Rosy, but she says no. He finds her place of business and makes Rosy an offer. He will take the pictures for free if she lets him use them in his portfolio. Rosy receives the photos for her website, and Jaxon gets them for the job. Rosy says yes to the agreement, but is she saying yes to anything else?<br/><br/>This movie makes a statement about having a job versus having a career. It takes a good nudge for Rosy to see her dream morphing into something unrecognizable. As her business and love interest fall to the waist side, Rosy discerns the truth. While the plot tries to make you worry, fans of the genre see the conclusion a mile away. This film has comedic moments but doesn't captivate its audience.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
