The auctioneer, Mr. Sims, congratulates Mitch.<br/><br/>Erica and Mitch move in and start making changes.  They turn in after a long day and prepare to sleep but get a knock at the door.  It's Theodore, the previous owner, and he wants to say bye to the home.  They allow him in, but Theodore admits to having an ulterior motive.  He wants to buy it from them.  While Erica and Mitch empathize, they refuse to sell Theodore their home.  Theodore tells them he is persistent, laughs, and leaves.  But it's not the last time they will see him.  Theodore has a secret room in the home and framed Mitch for Mr. Sims's murder.  Now, he only has Erica standing in his way.  Theodore will stop at nothing to get his family home back.<br/><br/>This movie provides enough suspense to keep you watching and laughing.  It starts with a heartfelt plea from Theodore that will leave you near tears.  Then, as Erica predicted, Theodore goes from depression to psychosis in a few days.

    "review":"Zuri, an interior designer, walks up to Viv's home, astonished by the wealth.  Zuri tells Viv that she is dating an artist named Stephon.  Viv offers Zuri the job with no budget or oversight.<br/><br/>Zuri volunteers at the Baltimore Literacy Foundation.  As she teaches, her boss brings in their new chair for the board of trustees, Godfrey Anderson.  Later, Zuri calls Stephon from the parking lot.  She doesn't have enough time to come home and get dressed for their friends' party.  But she has an outfit in the car and needs him to bring the shoes.  Zuri zips up her dress and hears a knock on the vehicle's window.  It's Godfrey.  He talks about his cousin getting work done at her home with an interior designer.  Zuri tells Godfrey about her job, and they compare notes.  They realize that his cousin and Zuri's client are the same people: Miss Viv.<br/><br/>At their friends' gathering, Zuri mentions that Stephon has the talent but not the ambition.  When they get home, Stephon erupts at Zuri.  Her comments embarrassed him.  Zuri meets with Godfrey to consult about his home.  He loves her ideas but wants her more and kisses her.  Zuri calls Stephon to end their relationship.  When Zuri goes home to pack, she finds an engagement ring.  Blistering with rage, Stephon tells Zuri that she doesn't love Godfrey, only his money.  She storms out and builds a new life with her new man.<br/><br/>Godfrey surprises her with a trip, and she doesn't hesitate.  Godfrey informs Zuri that he wants her to be on the board.  Godfrey gives Zuri the paperwork, and she signs it without a second thought.  Zuri's greed got her in a hole too deep to get out unscathed.  That hole includes fraud, overseas accounts, ruthless attacks, and Fentanyl.<br/><br/>Based on Greed: A Seven Deadly Sins Novel by Victoria Christopher Murray, the strongest of the Sin series starts and ends with a bang.  The plot shows the viewer the source of Zuri's greed but rightfully doesn't make you sympathize with her.  Viv and Godfrey spot Zuri's need for more and tell her it's okay to aspire to have those things.  In the end, the biggest gangster makes themselves known with a gun, fire, and one well-timed cigarette.  Give this one your full attention with your wine and tea next to you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
