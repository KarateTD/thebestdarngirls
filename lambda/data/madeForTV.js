    "review":"Angie sits at home with her little sister, Maddie, and waits for their parents.  Once again they are late, so Angie has to miss the party.  The next day, Angie walks with Maddie.  Maddie says she wants ice cream, so Angie pulls out her ukelele and sings for money.  Mario walks up to her and requests a song for $5.  When Mario spots Angie in the park again, he tells her he has an uncle that hires singers.<br/><br/>After her school recital, Angie's parents forget to attend or pick her up.  So Angie calls Mario.  Mario tells Angie he will take her home, but his uncle resides down the street and wants to hear her sing.  Angie walks into a room with Deacon and Ida .  Ida puts some makeup on Angie to add a pop of color, and Deacon walks her to the back.  As Angie starts to play for Rob, Deacon turns on a camera and leaves the room.  Rob gets up and sexually assaults Angie.  When Angie wakes up, Ida names her Angel and threatens to expose her assault if Angie tries to leave.  Angie is a victim of human trafficking, and escaping will only be 10% of the battle.<br/><br/>For survivors, some scenes can be triggering.  This movie stands out because it doesn't give a flowering end to escaping this modern-day slavery.  You witness survivors struggling with reconnecting with family, working with the police, and finding their voice.  And with physical or mental threats, some go back to their captors.  This movie is honest because everyone doesn't have a happy, clean-cut ending.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tracy reminds her husband, Chris, that their daughter, Sarah, will attend a spiritual retreat.  The next day, Chris finishes his lecture on mouth breeders and gets in his car.  He gets a call from an unknown number and ignores it.  But he picks it up the second time.  The caller tells Chris that they have his daughter.  Chris must pay $10,000 to get Sarah back unharmed.  If Chris alerts anyone or hangs up, they will kill Sarah.  Over the next 24 hours, Chris will go to hell and back for Sarah while trying to keep Tracy in the dark.<br/><br/>This movie shines a light on a dark phenomenon that has gained momentum over the years.  This crime happens because so much information is readily available with a mouse click.  While it's easy to play armchair detective while watching, being in this situation in real-time is different.  This film may seem outlandish, but it happens to people every day.  So don't disregard the fear and panic Chris emotes on the screen.  Watch this movie and make a plan with your family.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Heather calls Jess with a smile because she got the painting restoration job and $5,000.  Jess demands a celebration, and they go to a local bar.  They have a few drinks, and Heather walks up to the bartender, Marisol, for another round.  Heather never saw Tyler sitting at the bar, but Marisol thinks she remembers him from her past.<br/><br/>As Heather restores the painting, she sees her new neighbor, Tyler.
