    "review":"Narrated by Victoria Gotti, she walks you through her guarded childhood to her defiant teen years to her adulthood of painful events.  Through it all, Victoria has been a lioness.  Now, don't be fooled.  This isn't another veiled story about John Gotti.  It's the story of their unique father-daughter relationship.  It will be hard to watch this movie without shedding a tear.  But one thing is for sure, her upbringing helped her survive her life.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sawyer must convince his ex-girlfriend Jamie to let his company revamp the town.  But she isn't having it.  Jamie finds a card keepsake box and will use it to get the town to rally behind her.  This movie feels like a long commercial for their new keepsake box than a new movie.  The movie has funny moments but they are just not memorable.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Nina recalls the events that lead to her being accused of murdering Kelly, a straight A, cheerleader with a bright future and hurtful words.  Before Kelly's murder, Nina changed her looks and threaten Kelly.  When the killer is brought to light, the small, upper-class, perfect town is rocked.  The remake of the 1994 classic, based on a true story, is told from a different perspective but with no real revelations.  Fans of the original won't get the ski trip or mayo scene.  However, the crime is just as bloody and it will make you want to watch the original, now available for Amazon Prime members.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
