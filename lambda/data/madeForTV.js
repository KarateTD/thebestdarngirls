    "review": "Newlyweds Whitney and Michael party with friends while Whitney's sons, Brian and Eric, play video games with Brian's friend, Dante. Whitney answers a knock at the door and can't contain her shock. It's Michael's daughter, Joanna. She asks to stay with them. Michael is apprehensive, but Whitney welcomes Joanna with open arms.<br/><br/>Whitney prepares for a pitch meeting and invites Joanna on a girls' trip to the spa so they can bond. Joanna's not ready, and Whitney respects her decision. Whitney presents her makeup to Walmart, and the models' faces start to burn. As Whitney's life falls apart, she blames one person: Joanna. But can she prove it?<br/><br/>This movie follows 'The Step' formula until the very end with one huge twist. Joanna is a bad seed, but the storyline offers the viewers a reason. The acting is a solid B, but the director chose poor edits for the fight scene. The writers did a superb job of connecting the breadcrumbs in the film. So viewers should pay attention to the small details. As with most films in this genre, the killer's fate is open-ended. However, part two should give the audience some closure.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jen inspires her readers with blog posts, but can't finish her next novel. Her best friend, lawyer Portia, thinks Jen should use selling her home as a writing vacation. Jen doesn't see this as a vacation because she has to sell her house due to her impending divorce. Jen and Portia meet Jen's soon-to-be ex-husband, Roman, at the office. He wants to be present during the sale, but Jen says no. Besides, Roman is living in their old apartment with his girlfriend, Carly, whom Roman cheated on Jen with. Roman leaves, but he will keep an eye on her.<br/><br/>Jen returns to her hometown and arrives at the Twin Reads bookstore. She promised her friend, Susannah, that she would do a reading and signing for charity. During the event, the store's owner, Nora, inquires if Jen ever received her sister's letters. Nora's sister, Ava, dreamed of being a writer. Jen's books inspired her to leave her abusive husband, open the bookstore, and write. Sadly, her husband ended Ava's life. Jen offers to help Nora finish Ava's book. Nora oversteps this invitation and starts stalking Jen.<br/><br/>Later, Jen runs to clear her head and gets caught in a rope tied to an anchor. A man, Logan, untangles her. Logan is a P.I., hired by Roman to catch her with another man. He promises to keep his distance but warns her to take care of herself. Jen ignores Logan's warning until she's the primary suspect in Nora's murder. Can Jen clear her name?<br/><br/>This movie's storytelling is far better than that of other Lifetime movies. Since Jen is writing her book, you see her plot come to life on the screen. This change between Jen's plot and the actual events captivates the audience and demands your undivided attention. The makeup, hair, and costume departments created five-star looks for their characters. While the title hints at a high body count, the film offers two murders, including Ava's. While the title is a letdown, the filming style is entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sarah returns to her spa to retrieve her wallet. She finds her investor, Grant, dead with keys next to his body. Sarah's husband, Darren, is the owner of the keys. For months, Grant has been blackmailing them. She fears that Darren killed Grant and plans to pin the murder on her. She rushes home, cuts her IDs and credit cards, and finds her actual credentials with the name Felicity. Then, she rushes to her sister's workplace and begs for a 2nd chance. Erin invites Felicity to coffee, and Felicity swears she has changed, but doesn't elaborate on the details.<br/><br/>Darren leaves the concert early after his girlfriend, Sarah, doesn't show. He returns home and snoops through her things. Darren uncovers Sarah's true identity and gets Erin's address. Darren calls Erin and convinces her to meet. He begs Erin to set up a meeting for him. Erin agrees. Darren calls the salon, and the receptionist, Britney, answers. Britney tells Darren that the police found Grant in the woods.<br/><br/>Felicity meets with Erin. Erin tries to convince Felicity to sit down with Darren. Finally, Felicity reveals the truth. Darren will kill her because she is the only witness to his crime. Felicity and Darren are both in danger. Someone killed Grant, and they need someone to take the fall. Who will go down for Grant's slaying?<br/><br/>The film starts with Felicity finding a body, running, and someone shooting at her. Then, she destroyed her documentation. You don't know who Felicity is, her fears, or her innocence. Suddenly, the writers thrust Darren into the storyline. It is not until the first commercial break that we understand why Felicity is running. Writers must understand that Lifetimers will give a film one commercial break to capture their attention. If it doesn't or is too confusing, Lifetimers will change the channel. This movie will make you want to reach for the remote, but give it 45 minutes.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Helen rings in her daughter's tenth birthday with a delicious breakfast. Before she leaves for work, Helen asks her daughter, Penny, to go through the latch-key rules. Penny must not talk to strangers, walk straight home, text before leaving school, text at home, never text while walking, and lock the door. Penny agrees with a groan.<br/><br/>Helen drives to work at the home of Roman and Aurelia Durand. Roman owns Durand Industries, and his wife works as a scientist for the company. Their house manager, Tiffany, handles the staff while Roman's assistant, best friend Danny, visits daily. Helen heard the news about a woman named Jane. Danny hushes Helen because they recently fired Jane. He is writing a press release, but the death is a sore subject for the Durands.<br/><br/>Helen drives home with gifts and balloons. She finds the front door open and cautiously enters. She discovers Penny's book bag and phone on the ground, but she can't locate Penny. Then, an unknown number texts her with a threat and a picture of Penny. The kidnapper calls her and tells Helen to do as they say. They want her to return to work tomorrow and will request that she do three things to expose her boss and his wrongdoings. Helen agrees to become a mole for the kidnappers to save Penny. Will she succeed?<br/><br/>This movie is a Hallmark-level mystery on Lifetime. The opening offers a suspicious death in a self-driving vehicle. The plot introduces us to each character, their backstory, and their weakness. The kidnapper's monologue brings everything to the surface, especially the clues you missed. You will gawk at the screen as the kidnapper lays out their motives and how they did it. Its only downfall is Penny's setting. The viewer can easily spot her location, hinting at the kidnapper. This film is a must-watch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nora left her job at H company with her current boss, Alexandra. Their previous boss, Everett, warned them that if they left, their job wouldn't be there. Alexandra threw caution to the wind. She started her firm, Rankin Advertising, with a small but dedicated staff. Nora meets her best friend, Shannon, for dinner. Nora reaffirms that she will never return to H Company. Especially after a past co-worker, James, took credit for her idea. She vows to work harder to attract new clients. Shannon requests ice cream from the waitstaff, but they only have spumoni. Shannon politely says no. She loves Darlington Ice Cream and its unique flavors. Ann Marie and Matthew Darlington own the Wisconsin dairy farm. Nora discovers they don't have representation and chooses to introduce them to Alexandra. Alexandra loves the product and tells Nora to go to Wisconsin to entice them.<br/><br/>Everett hands out bonuses to his team for a job well done. James and Avery wonder who will get the new VP job. Everett meets with the board, and they create a deciding factor. Whoever finds a new client and brings them to the firm will get the position. James walks while talking on his phone. He bumps into Nora, and she drops some ice cream. James reads the label, researches the company, and calls Matthew for a meeting. James tells Everett about Darlington Farms, and Everett tells James to book an economy flight.<br/><br/>James and Nora arrive at the Darlington home at the same time. Ann Marie and Matthew want them to work on the farm and understand the labor that goes into a dairy farm. They won't decide on a firm until the Ice Cream Festival. James and Nora agree to their terms and exit for their car. Outside, James and Nora make a deal. They won't sabotage each other, will stay professional, they won't use ice cream, and they will wait to make their pitch. James and Nora shake, and a spark flows between them. Will Nora and James ignite their passion? Or will Everett and Alexandra pull them apart?<br/><br/>This plot follows the story of two enemies finding love in a competition. The conclusion is obvious. However, it's the secondary characters that grab your attention. Ann Marie and Matthew are childhood sweethearts who give the main characters sage advice about love, partnership, and communication. Everett demands that James be cutthroat at every turn. Alexandra wants Nora to play by the rules, but beware of James's underhanded tactics. They will give the viewers pause as they contradict the Darlingtons. This film won't be a favorite of the season, but it's compelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
