    "mtitle":"Private Princess Christmas",
    "review":"Princess Violet fails another task when Wingravia is watching. Her mother, the Queen, grows tired of Violet's irresponsibility. The Queen doesn't believe Violet is ready. She thinks her brother is a more suitable option. Violet gawks at the idea of her uncle on the throne. However, he has a plan. When Violet's uncle acted unfavorably, his father sent him to a boot camp in Colorado. Violet thinks it is ridiculous until the Queen's stipulation. Violet can only get the throne if she graduates boot camp. Violet agrees.<br/><br/>Captain Ryan works at the customer service desk at a big box store. He deals with one entitled customer after another. Then, Ryan sees his commanding officer standing in front of him. Chesterfield Academy needs a new leader for its recruits. The officer wants Ryan to return. Ryan agrees after the next entitled customer.<br/><br/>Ryan gets the rundown of their recruits from his right-hand Squibby. He gives the lay of the land and takes their technology. He will teach them the core principles of the boot camp to get them on the right path. However, Princess Violet won't give in easily. Ryan refuses to let her take control because he doesn't want to lose another recruit. Can Violet pass boot camp and get the throne?<br/><br/>Viewers shouldn't watch this movie if they are in the military. No officer would ever let a cadet disrespect them the way Violet does. The script allows Violet to recover because Violet has a kind heart for those in need. This movie can kill two hours, but you can skip it this holiday season.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
