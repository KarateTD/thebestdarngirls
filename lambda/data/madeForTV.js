    "review":"Zuri, an interior designer, walks up to Viv's home, astonished by the wealth.  Zuri tells Viv that she is dating an artist named Stephon.  Viv offers Zuri the job with no budget or oversight.<br/><br/>Zuri volunteers at the Baltimore Literacy Foundation.  As she teaches, her boss brings in their new chair for the board of trustees, Godfrey Anderson.  Later, Zuri calls Stephon from the parking lot.  She doesn't have enough time to come home and get dressed for their friends' party.  But she has an outfit in the car and needs him to bring the shoes.  Zuri zips up her dress and hears a knock on the vehicle's window.  It's Godfrey.  He talks about his cousin getting work done at her home with an interior designer.  Zuri tells Godfrey about her job, and they compare notes.  They realize that his cousin and Zuri's client are the same people: Miss Viv.<br/><br/>At their friends' gathering, Zuri mentions that Stephon has the talent but not the ambition.  When they get home, Stephon erupts at Zuri.  Her comments embarrassed him.  Zuri meets with Godfrey to consult about his home.  He loves her ideas but wants her more and kisses her.  Zuri calls Stephon to end their relationship.  When Zuri goes home to pack, she finds an engagement ring.  Blistering with rage, Stephon tells Zuri that she doesn't love Godfrey, only his money.  She storms out and builds a new life with her new man.<br/><br/>Godfrey surprises her with a trip, and she doesn't hesitate.  Godfrey informs Zuri that he wants her to be on the board.  Godfrey gives Zuri the paperwork, and she signs it without a second thought.  Zuri's greed got her in a hole too deep to get out unscathed.  That hole includes fraud, overseas accounts, ruthless attacks, and Fentanyl.<br/><br/>Based on Greed: A Seven Deadly Sins Novel by Victoria Christopher Murray, the strongest of the Sin series starts and ends with a bang.  The plot shows the viewer the source of Zuri's greed but rightfully doesn't make you sympathize with her.  Viv and Godfrey spot Zuri's need for more and tell her it's okay to aspire to have those things.  In the end, the biggest gangster makes themselves known with a gun, fire, and one well-timed cigarette.  Give this one your full attention with your wine and tea next to you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

When someone else dies as Charly becomes the next target, they need to figure out who is behind it all and why.<br/><br/>Stick with this movie.  It gets better and throws you for a loop with one 30-second conversation.  This film feels like the typical Lifetime mystery with a black hoodie in the shadows.

    "review":"Mary and Scott move with their daughter, Casey, from California to Georgia for Scott's new job opportunity.  After his first movie flopped, Mr. Nelson, a producer, called Scott to direct a documentary.  Mr. Nelson wants Scott to join the Cornerstone Church with spyglasses to expose the hypocrisy within the religion, church, and its members.  At first, Scott is uncomfortable gathering information on his neighbors.  Then he gets some surprising news that Mary is pregnant.  With strained finances, Mary and Scott need the money with the baby on the way.  So Scott takes the job.  In the end, Scott will learn the truth about the church, Mr. Nelson, and himself with one expos√© and a black eye.<br/><br/>This movie will keep you interested while giving you a dose of actual religion.  This church helps each other, goes on missions to improve others' well-being, and prays with each other.  Every time Scott wants to criticize, his small group proves him wrong.  Scott learns that the least religious person on his block has a kind soul.  This movie only has one villain, and it's Mr. Nelson.  And his monologue about hurting the church will make you ill.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Before singing in front of her graduating class, Vicky's father, Robert, gives her a patch for Prestige School of Music.  When Vicky opens her mouth to sing 'I'm Every Woman,' Robert has a heart attack and dies.  After some time in community college, Vicky is ready to apply to Prestige.  But when she gets home, she sees her uncle, Blake, with a For Sale sign.  Blake tells them that Robert's insurance didn't payout.  They will lose the house without the money, and Vicky can't go to college.  Vicky's mother, Gwen, tells Vicky to apply.<br/><br/>Vicky walks down the Prestige's halls and bumps into the famed singer, Bryan Moore.  She tells the admissions administrative assistant, Junior, and Junior tells her that Bryan is their new teacher.  Vicky can't wait to attend and learn from him.  But she worries Gwen won't solve the financial issues in time.  So Vicky inquires about scholarships.  Junior tells Vicky that the school has one scholarship left, and that's for the winner of Summer Fest.  Summer Fest is only for fraternities.  So the winner must be male, in a frat with two members and a student at the school. Vicky will say that she is transitioning to create a frat on campus with Junior and a friendless, talented loser.  Junior says yes because he hates the chancellor, Mr. Davis, and knows the loser for the job: Mitch.  Vicky and Junior need to keep this from Mr. Davis, her family, and her church if she wants to get the scholarship.<br/><br/>This movie is cute but a little campy.  But in times like these, the depiction of faking a transition can be dicey.  This film felt too long but had a realistic ending.  The family guides itself out of grief with faith, banding together, and a strong church community.  And hearing Gwen stand up to a greedy insurance company will make you beam with pride.  Save this movie for a rainy day.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Demetra pulls the priest, Father John, aside and asks him to pray for her dad, Jimmy.  Her mother died a few years ago, and she wants Jimmy to date her dance teacher, Faith.  Later, Faith throws a silent auction fundraiser for her dance studio.  It needs retrofitting, or the government will shut the school down.  One of the prizes is a dance lesson with her, and Jimmy bids but loses.  Faith has a dance-off with the top 2 bidders when the previous winner cancels, and Jimmy wins.<br/><br/>They go to dinner to celebrate their first lesson.  She reveals her ex-husband cheated after discovering she couldn't get pregnant.  She tried all the dating apps but never made a connection.  As they dance together, Jimmy and Faith will overcome the pain of the past to create a future built on Demetra's prayer.<br/><br/>This movie follows the rom-com format, but it does have something special.  Faith has professional and personal struggles that rarely get coverage on this station.  While this movie has a religious undertone, it doesn't alienate the viewer.  And their final dance will leave love in your heart.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
