        "review":"After waking up in the hospital with injuries from a car accident, Patsy hears Loretta singing one of her songs on the radio.  Patsy asks her husband to bring Loretta to her hospital room.  Loretta comes into the room loaded with an apology but Patsy was flattered by her dedication.  The two talk about their music, their husbands, and their children.  Patsy takes Loretta under her wing and helps guide her career.  The two form a friendship that lasts until Patsy's untimely demise.<br/><br/>In a time of hashtag girl power, this movie is the embodiment of female empowerment.  Patsy never saw Loretta as a threat, she saw Loretta as a friend and admirer.  It's difficult to imagine today's artists being able to do the same thing without their ego getting in the way.  We should all be students like Loretta to become teachers like Patsy.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"On her girls' trip, Kathy has a sexy tryst with a young maintenance worker named Ian.  She goes home to her daughter and her new job like nothing happened.  That changes on her first day of school as principal.  Ian is there and he is a student.  While he can legally consent, she worries he will talk.  When her daughter Bree starts hanging out with Ian, Kathy tries to put a stop to it.  Kathy believes she has it under control until Ian shows her a video of their night together.  He wants money or he will release the tape.  Ian is blackmailing Kathy for love, but not his love of her.  The love of someone he is bonded within tragedy.<br/><br/>You must watch this movie from the beginning to weave in all the moving parts.  Ian is not after Kathy for her body or love, he wants justice.  The story is bland, the twist unimaginative, and the conclusion is average.  This is a movie to watch while you tweet.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Olivia even steps in to defend Deandra from her bullies.  Soon, Deandra and Olivia are inseparable.  Renee, Deandra's mother, worries Olivia is a bad influence.  With a bond so strong, Olivia will do anything to anyone to keep it.  Only a gun could come between them.<br/><br/>New girl makes a best friend that's crazy and takes a long time to figure it out.  Sounds familiar? It should.  It's like most storylines in the Psycho Genre.  This movie doesn't stand out in any way and can be used as background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"After helping Reggie get the woman of his dreams, David receives $500 as payment.  This gives David an idea: Create an app and charge to give men dating advice.  The fee will include personal one-on-one training.  David presents his idea to his best friend AJ.  AJ uses his newly acquired certifications to create the app and they call it Swag, Inc..  The first day, they get 20,000 subscribers and quit their jobs.  Both are elated to have the app up and successful but their is trouble brewing around the corner.  AJ paid Swag, Inc. hosting account with his old company's credit card.  AJ's boss wants him to turn over Swag, Inc. or they will sue and have him put in jail.  AJ and David have to find a way to keep Swag, Inc..  The solution is in the question.<br/><br/>While AJ and David can get any woman they want, they can't maintain the relationship.  Unfortunately, they approached creating an app the same way they did dating.  It's easy for the viewer to understand, they must strive for longevity to be successful.  It's the only way the app can grow.  This movie is funny but it can get corny at times.<br/><br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Now, Detective Logan stands over Lyle's body determining what happened to the tenured professor.  His house was ransacked but nothing was stolen.  Tess, against the advice of Detective Logan, starts to investigate.  It will take a cipher, beef stew, and a children's book to solve this mystery.  Will Tess live to see the perpetrator captured.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe but Hallmark has made a detective out of a crossword editor.  The second installment in this series is 10 times more captivating than its predecessor.  There are multiple suspects with a plethora of motives.  The viewer is allowed to solve the case along with Tess while getting to know Tess and Logan better.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
