    "review":"Alice enjoys life with her husband, Marty, and is close friends with Marty's brother, Roger, and Roger's wife, Carrie. As Alice gets ready for the day, there is a knock at the door.  She opens it to find a horrific nightmare from her past, Ray.  Ray was her husband's partner.  Not Marty, but her first husband, Allen.  Back then, Alice was Liz, and Allen was physically, emotionally, and financially abusive. He saw Liz with her bags packed and headed for the door.  In an attempt to stop her, Liz kicked Allen down the steps and killed him.  She ran from the house, and Ray saw her drive away. Ray wants $100,000 by the end of the day.  Or Ray will rat her out. Alice worries her new life with Marty will fall apart if Marty learns the truth about her past.  So, Alice will do everything she can to get the money and keep Ray quiet.  But Ray won't stop at cash because he has a bigger prize in mind.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the best uncomfortable moments in an LMN movie. You sit on pins and needles, wondering if Ray will spill the beans. Moments like these will make you squirm, and it's worth it. Be warned this film can be a trigger for domestic violence survivors.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Monique sits her family down to tell them she found the man of her dreams, Colin. Her family wants to meet him, so Monique invites Colin to dinner.  Monique and Colin met in a support group for widows and widowers. Monique's daughter, Kainyah, has an interest in interior design, and Colin offers to help.  Monique's lawyer and brother-in-law, Curtis, and her sister, Anne, don't care for Colin because he is too smooth. Colin's background comes up squeaky clean, but it's not enough for Anne. Anne is justified to be suspicious of Colin.  Well, at least that's his name now.  Colin is a con-man that seduces lonely rich women. He owes money to dangerous people.  And if Colin doesn't pay, he will die.  With his life on the line, Colin will kill and manipulate anyone to get his money.<br/><br/>This movie could easily be on Lifetime or LMN and fit in without question.  It did add a compelling twist to the film to keep you watching, but it gives you all the kills you expect.  This time it isn't the typical con.  Colin is fighting for his life.  And as frustrating as Monique can be, she gains her senses in the nick of time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Harry and Meghan: Escaping the Palace",
    "review":"Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan moved to the countryside to get away from the prying eye of the paparazzi and the palace. Her mother helps with the baby, and Leonard keeps them connected to the monarchy.  But nightmares plague Harry.  He sees Meghan begging for help in a turnover car with photographers taking pictures. Each day Harry sees Meghan wilt into a royal robot, and it reminds him of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. He tells his family that he wants to leave the firm without the support of his brother, his father, or his country.  Can Harry and Meghan make it out with their marriage intact?<br/><br/>The third installment of Lifetime's Harry and Meghan's story does not disappoint.  It focuses on Harry's emotional parallel of seeing his wife suffer compared to seeing his mother suffer. This movie unquestionably displays that leaving is Harry's idea. Each comparison scene helps you gain clarity on Harry's decision to leave.  It helps to watch the movie from the beginning and uninterrupted to get the full impact.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sam admits that she has a creative block and needs a new challenge to clear it.  She works for Wedding Belles and writes other's love stories but has nothing to write for herself. A social media influencer, Heather, is getting married in Everlasting Vineyards, and Heather selected Wedding Belles to cover her wedding. Sam knows Everlasting well because she grew up there, so the boss doubles down on her decision. At home, everyone tries to tell Sam something, but she keeps cutting them off.  At the venue, Sam meets Heather and her assistant, Chase, for the first time.  While talking about the wedding, Heather's fiance, Liam, walks in.  Liam is Sam's high school sweetheart and the man that broke her heart years ago. They decide to stay mum about the situation for the sake of Heather and Liam's wedding. But as fate pulls them together, will Sam pull Heather and Liam apart?<br/><br/>While this movie has funny moments, it's predictable the moment you meet Heather. But she is your reason to watch. And her yes-man, Chase, is a riot.  With so many recognizable characters in this Hallmark genre, Heather is the breath of fresh air the script needs to keep you watching.  While you want to write her off for being a brat, she is the most entertaining aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
