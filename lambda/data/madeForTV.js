    "mtitle":"Buying Back My Daughter",
    "review":"Dana and Curtis move into their new home with their daughters, Cadence and Alicia. Cadence easily adjusts, but Alicia faces difficulties. So Dana and Curtis throw a barbecue and invite their neighbors and a few teens. Days later, Alicia asks to attend a tailgate party for her school. Dana says no but offers an alternative. She will let Alicia have a sleepover and invite a few friends.<br/><br/>Alicia and her friends watch T.V., eat junk food, and give each other makeovers. Dana says good night and leaves. Alicia's friend, Tamara, gets up, opens the door, and peers around the corner. Tamara informs Alicia they are sneaking out. Tamara promises to be home before Curtis and Dana wake up. Alicia sneaks out. She meets her crush at the tailgate but leaves when he tries to kiss her. Alicia tries to convince her friends to leave, but they refuse. She informs that she is going home.<br/><br/>Dana prepares breakfast for the girls and calls them to the kitchen. Tamara tells Dana that Alicia is in her bedroom when Dana doesn't see Alicia. Dana finds an empty bed with perfect sheets. Dana concludes that Alicia is missing and calls everyone she knows. Dana and Curtis go to the police station, and they don't care because Alicia is 16. They assume she ran away. Dana refuses to believe Alicia ran away and starts a campaign to find her. Dana's search will unmask the dark side of the internet and the evils of sex trafficking.<br/><br/>This movie covers a complex and emotional topic but holds nothing back. Alicia's abduction has a ripple effect on her family. Sadly, Dana learns finding Alicia is 10% of the battle. Alicia suffers from physical, sexual, and chemical abuse. This movie doesn't provide a sunshine-and-flowers ending. The conclusion is horrifying and honest. This film is astounding, but viewers should prepare themselves.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hannah accompanies her sister, Michelle, as Michelle looks for a house. Michelle asks Joann to find a home that matches her wallet. Hannah returns to the Cookie Jar and meets with Jed. Jed joyously tells Hannah that he fixed her oven. Hannah returns to the counter, and her employee, Lisa, alerts Hannah that Rhonda didn't pick up her lemon meringue pie.

    "mtitle":"Secrets Beneath the Floorboards",
    "review":"Whitney buries her husband, Al, with her sister, Bella, and brother-in-law, Brad, by her side. Whitney wants to focus on burying her husband but can't because Detective Hinkles surveils her. Someone murdered Al, and Detective Hinkles suspects Whitney, although she has an alibi. Laurie, Al's executive assistant, offers her condolences and asks to help the family.<br/><br/>Whitney and Brad meet with Al's attorney to discuss Al's will. They do a double take when Laurie walks into the conference room. Al left their apartment and vacation home to Whitney, but he gave everything else to Laurie. Whitney excuses herself and leaves in a fury. As Detective Hinkle approaches, Brad meets Whitney outside to console her but alleges that Al and Laurie had an affair. Whitney leaves in disgust and races home. Whitney calls Bella to inform Bella that she is leaving town and driving to their grandmother's lake house. They both believe their grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, haunts that home.<br/><br/>Whitney arrives at the lake house but refuses to go to the attic. Her grandmother warned them about evil men coming to the house and taught them how to protect themselves. Bella calls Whitney to check in and warn her. Detective Hinkle questioned Bella again because Whitney went out of town. Whitney wants to discover the truth about Al, his murder, and the culprit to clear their names. Whitney opens Al's laptop but doesn't know the password. She recalls that Al liked the lake house, and she gets an idea where to look: under the floorboards. They hold more secrets than Whitney could have imagined.<br/><br/>This movie takes the scenic route to the point. Also, the script adds suspicious characters, but experienced Lifetimers know they are bait. The plot takes a dip into the NFT and digital wallet world, but you don't need to be an expert. The film's saving grace is the final act. The sisters come together and defeat the culprit using low-tech solutions and wit. This movie wraps up all the stories and gives the viewer a satisfying end for a slow beginning.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Monster High 2",
    "review":"Clawdeen is famous on Eek Tok but doesn't know how to handle her newfound popularity. Frankie felt powerless after their battle with Mr. Komos, so her parents gave her monster upgrades the day before school. She is learning how to use them. Draculaura's father, Dracula, wants to have a blowout party for her 16 hundredth birthday. It's a coming of age for vampires, but she wants something more low-key. But Dracula won't hear it. Cleo's scarabs alert her to the arrival of Toralei, a werecat. Toralie is famous on campus because she survived a witch attack and has the scars to prove it. She warns everyone to steer clear of witches because they are dangerous.<br/><br/>During the school assembly, Headmistress Bloodgood announces the candidates for Prefect. The Prefect will be the voice of the student body. But the school, as in the building, decides it. Not the students. The school chooses Toralei and Clawdeen as nominees. Toralei immediately starts her campaign. So, Draculaura makes posters, and Cleo elects herself Clawdeen's election manager.<br/><br/>Draculaura leaves her dorm to practice witchcraft. She finds Ellis, a vampire, doing the same. While Draculaura learns new spells with Ellis, two witches sneak into her dorm room. Frankie and Clawdeen fight them off, but Frankie blows up the power grid in the battle. Toralei uses the attack to fearmonger the students and the staff to ban witchcraft at Monster High until further notice. Draculaura leaves. Ellis follows and relieves his true self to her. He isn't a vampire. He is a human witch and needs her help to end the war between their kinds. Ellis's mother, Zamara, is the queen of Salem Coven, and she wants peace. Draculaura hopes the treaty will allow the Monster High to accept witchcraft.<br/><br/>Clawdeen and Frankie wake up to find a dumb copy of Draculaura in her coffin. It worked on Bloodgood, but there is more trouble brewing. Dracula decided to respect Draculaura's wishes and have a small party at the school. He is coming in 2 days, and a copy won't fool him. Clawdeen and Frankie enter Ellis's room and find a luggage tag with Coleman Eve's logo. They discover that it's in Seattle, the human world. Clawdeen will go to Seattle and bring Draculaura home. Before Dracula and the school learn the truth. Clawdeen, Frankie, and Draculaura will have their powers and friendship tested.<br/><br/>This sequel places the friends in their sophomore year. They are comfortable on campus but not in their skin. The school's Prefect elections test their tolerance. This film sparks a debate on how a small subgroup can ignite a fear that can spread like wildfire. But this movie warns its audience with monster puns, running gags, and easter eggs. This overall story of friendship is an alert about political fearmongering without lecturing to the audience. The plot, songs, and costumes are solid, entertaining, and fun, and prepare you for Monster High 3.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
