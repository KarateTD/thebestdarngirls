    "review":"The town is preparing for the Christmas Festival with the wishing tree, the choir, and everyone selling their goods at the local market. Elizabeth works with Nathan’s niece Ally in the choir. Elizabeth is happy to help but she is worried Jack hasn’t spoken his first word. She is trying to be patient but he will be one soon. Nathan has an important decision to make. He got an inspector promotion but it’s in Union City. He will make more money and provide a better life for Ally. The downside, they will have to move again. He has to make a decision soon that will affect others, not just his family.<br/><br/>This installment of the popular TV series feels more like a 2-hour episode than a movie. Hearties will love the build-up for the love triangle to come. Non-hearties will become disinterested in the plot. Non-hearties should start with last Christmas's episode and that season. Anyone else will love this episode.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"During a church nativity play, the lights go out. When they come back on, the baby Jesus doll has been replaced with a real baby girl. Alison, a social worker, calls out to the audience for the parents but no one comes forward. She starts to take the baby when Detective Brock steps on stage. They are both responsible for the baby girl. After the baby is checked out, Alison and Brock are told there are no open spots in any local foster home. Before Alison’s boss, David starts looking outside the city, Alison offers to take the baby. With Brock’s help, they become attached to the baby girl but form a different opinion of the parents. Alison has compassion for the parents but Brock wants them in jail. This topic, albeit an important one, is keeping them from their truest connections: the baby girl and each other.<br/><br/>This is one of the most impactful movies this holiday season. It has a love story but it’s in the background. The focus is on the baby and her parents. Each main character lays out their feelings so eloquently, you understand their side. Your heart bleeds for this poor child. UP TV saved the best for last.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After being passed over for a promotion, Amber decides to head home to Colorado to stay at her Aunt Dora’s inn. Dora is a legendary R&B singer who gave up life on the road to run the inn. Dora asks Alan to pick up Amber and bring her to the inn. Amber mistakes Alan for a regular car service and acts dismissive towards him. When she learns he is a friend of her aunt and the music teacher, she apologizes. After a few days, she offers to help with the school fundraiser. Alan doesn't put much fanfare into it until the school board cuts funding for the music program. With Amber’s help, he will kick the fundraiser into high gear. And with Dora brushing off her microphone, anything can happen.<br/><br/>Patti LaBelle is the saving grace of this movie. It’s a sweet story that has been done too much this holiday season. This movie becomes background noise until Patti starts to sing. With that being said, you do get great ideas for running a fundraiser for your local school. Otherwise, record and fast forward to Patti.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"With a sick feeling, Chelsea presents her app design to her boss. Chelsea’s design is extremely similar to Blythe’s design. Her boss believes someone copied the other but can’t prove it. Since Blythe has been with the company longer, she puts Blythe in charge of the app and tells Chelsea to report to her. Mrs. Kringle shows up for the photoshoot a day early. Chelsea is surprised because she doesn’t remember hiring anyone. However, Mrs. Kingle gets the job by giving sage advice to Chelsea. Chelsea starts to see weird things happen around her after Mrs. Kringle touches her phone. Chelsea's app is magic. She can mark someone as naughty and change their actions for the better. Chelsea is changing everyone she knows but who will benefit?<br/><br/>This movie does a great job of changing your perspective on the protagonist. At first, you think Chelsea is a doormat for her co-workers, best friend, and boyfriend. You want her to stand up for herself and speak her mind. Instead of being just a pushover, you see she has been taking advantage of others too. Seeing this type of complex character is moving in a holiday film.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, the town of Riverton couldn’t agree on political matters.  So they divided the town into two parts: East and West Riverton.  Liam is the mayor of West Riverton and his assistant is Kendall.  Sarah is the mayor of East Riverton and her assistant is Yale.  Liam and Sarah have been competing since grade school.  The only place in town considered neutral is Maureen’s coffee shop.  Maureen considers herself to be Switzerland.  The winner will get a cash prize for their Rec Center, a candle named after their town, and bragging rights.  Sarah and Liam will try every trick in the book for their town to be on top, too bad Maureen, Kendall, and Yale have something up their sleeves too.<br/><br/>This movie is a fun competition movie, as their attempts to be sneaky fall flat every time.  Other than that, the rest of the movie is the typical Hallmark format.  The overall winner is a nice change of pace but you can watch the last 30 minutes for that.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
