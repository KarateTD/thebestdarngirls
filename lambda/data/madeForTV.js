    "review":"Amy walks to Silver Fashion House with an armload of fabrics. The CEO's daughter, Blair, rushes past Amy and doesn't offer help. Amy stops by seamstress Wanda's desk and hands Wanda a fabric bundle. Wanda forgot to order it the night before. Wanda's divorce affects her work, but she promises to do better.<br/><br/>Blair sits in her mother's office while her mother, Vanessa, scolds her for partying in their latest fashion while intoxicated. Blair wants to create an affordable line, but Vanessa says no and demands that Blair exit. Amy enters, and Vanessa shocks her. She wants Amy to take over the company, not Blair. Then, Vanessa looks through dresses for their upcoming runway show, finds poorly-made stitching, and has an asthma attack. She asks for the person responsible, and Amy admits it's Wanda. Vanessa wants Amy to prove she has CEO skills and demands that she fire Wanda. Regretfully, Amy walks to Wanda's desk and lets her go.<br/><br/>Amy tells her boyfriend, Kevin, about Vanessa's vision for Silver. However, Kevin, a therapist, is underwhelmed. Amy begs Kevin to be more encouraging, and he relents.<br/><br/>Amy arrives at work and sees the coroner removing Vanessa's body from the premises. The police believe Vanessa had an asthma attack and died. Amy knows Vanessa would misplace her inhaler, but Vanessa never lost it. Amy asks the police about the security cameras, but earlier, someone turned them off before Vanessa's death. Amy pretends to accept the police's theory.<br/><br/>Blair sits at Vanessa's will reading when Amy enters. Vanessa left the property and 10% of the company to Blair. However, she left the rest of Silver to Amy. Blair rages. She believes Amy knew about the will change and killed Vanessa to take over. Amy swears she didn't do it and laughs at Blair's allegations until the police believe Blair. Can Amy prove her innocence while running the company?<br/><br/>This movie is a masterclass in misdirection. The plot establishes viable suspects with suspicious behaviors, motives, and leading clues. The story makes Amy look disoriented for a moment. Some viewers will wonder if she's the killer. With so much buildup, the culprit is less revealing. This film is like a roller coaster, a wild ride that ends predictably.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Kate finished her college degree and now worries about paying her student loan.

She walks around the office to find a switch and runs into the cleaning lady, Maria, and Maria's son, Stephan. They have a cleaning business and care for the offices at night. Maria, Kate, and Stephan finish work simultaneously. So, Maria invites Kate to a late night out, and Kate agrees.<br/><br/>Kate loves the small bar and has a great conversation with Maria. Maria sees an off-duty officer, Josh, and waves. Josh moonlights at some of the same buildings she cleans. A few days later, Stephan asks Kate out on a date, and she politely rejects him. Eric overhears their conversation and fires Stephan and Maria.<br/><br/>After a long work day, Eric offers to drive Kate home. He asks to use her bathroom when they arrive, and she agrees. Kate opens her door and discovers her ex-boyfriend, Matt, waiting for her. Matt explains that he isn't over Kate, but she doesn't want to date him.<br/><br/>Kate and Eric finish their project, and he wants to celebrate. Eric makes advances toward Kate, and she fights him off. Maria yells at Eric, and he backs off. Kate leaves with Maria.

Eric reports Kate to Josh as a missing person. Josh vouches for Maria and Stephan because they are kind people. Ann won't hear it. Can they find Kate and her kidnapper?<br/><br/>If you don't read the synopsis on other sites, this movie offers a mystery for 45 minutes. Kate has several unstable men in her life. Her ex-boyfriend, Matt, her boss, Eric, and Stephan. The kidnapper is foreseeable if you read another site's synopsis. However, the motive is disgusting but sadly believable. This movie doesn't require your undivided attention but is mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Zoe finishes her final proposal for her boss, Penny, and is ready to start her company. She picks up the newspaper to see if her favorite column, Ask Adora, picked her letter. To her surprise, the advise columnist responded. Zoe wants to get married to her boyfriend, Cary. Adora tells Zoe to be direct, but she has to be willing to accept any answer. Zoe likes the advice and plans to use it at their dinner.<br/><br/>Zoe meets Cary at the restaurant. They speak simultaneously. She wants to get married, but he wants to break up. Zoe spirals.

She grabs the newspaper to get inspiration from Adora and sees an address. Zoe walks to Adora's work to find Adora's office. Zoe finds a man, Adam, at the desk with a picture of Adora on the wall. Zoe deciphers the truth. Adam is Adora. Adam informs Zoe that he is a licensed marriage counselor who offers excellent advice. Then, Zoe gets an idea. Adam can be her pretend boyfriend in the posts. If he doesn't, she will expose his secret. He agrees to help her, but will they get more?<br/><br/>Zoe and Cary are the perfect example of a couple on the same page but in a different book. Adam hides behind the Adora persona and tries to help everyone. However, he's failing himself. Adam piles work on his plate to avoid more pressing issues. Zoe's drive pushes her to be perfect. However, she must learn that imperfection is wonderful and singlehood has its blessings. While the film has funny moments, you won't feel a need to rewind to see missed scenes. The script becomes dull as Zoe and Adam arrive at their foreseeable conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Zoey and Avery prepare to interview local Santas for the Christmas Festival. If they do well, the mayor will let them do the interior design for the new city building. While Zoey is excited, they have a problem. Someone keeps sending threats to end the festival. Avery walks to the front to bring in the first batch of Santa's but only finds one left. They interview and hire him.<br/><br/>Architect Dalton arrives late with coffee for his father's assistant, Wilson. Dalton presents his green initiative for the new city building. Dalton's father, Parker, likes the idea but not Dalton's tardiness. He wants Dalton to prove himself. The town's Christmas Festival will fund the new building. He wants Dalton to help the organizer. If he does well, then Parker will let Dalton design the building.<br/><br/>Zoey meets with the townspeople at the abandoned newspaper factory and asks them to volunteer. Gus, Alyx, and Mr. Amberson offer to volunteer their time and services. Dalton introduces himself and Wilson to Zoey. Zoey doesn't want his help but accepts when she discovers Dalton will be the architect for the building she wants to decorate. Dalton asks to view their Christmas decorations, and Zoey takes him to the back room. She opens the door and sees a mess. Someone destroyed the decorations. Zoey and Avery explain that someone is attempting to sabotage the festival. Zoey and Dalton will work together to uncover the culprit so they can keep their jobs.<br/><br/>This standalone sequel doesn't have the murder of a Hallmark Mystery but provides an intriguing enigma. Besides the mystery, viewers get three love stories. The leads are the first love story, like any holiday romance. Next is Avery and Wilson. Finally, you have Avery's mom, Phyllis, and her baking rival, Jim. Each love story slows down the mystery. That storyline separates this film from others this holiday season. Hopefully, the next installment will be fewer love stories and more Christmas mysteries.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
