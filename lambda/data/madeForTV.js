    "mtitle": "Taken at a Basketball Game",
    "review": "Security guard Wayne calls his daughter, Robyn, on her 18th birthday to offer well wishes. However, he becomes upset at her dismissive tone. Wayne surprises Robyn by showing up at his ex-wife's home to take Robyn to a basketball game. The pair take a walk in the park, and he convinces her to go.<br/><br/>Robyn and Wayne look for seats when a woman, Donna, compliments Robyn on her boots. Robyn sparks a friendly conversation, but Wayne sharply ends it. Robyn angrily sits next to Wayne and has an uncomfortable conversation about their past, their relationship, and his attitude. Robyn abruptly leaves for the bathroom.<br/><br/>Robyn sees Donna in the bathroom and apologizes for Wayne's behavior. Donna accepts and accidentally spills beer on Robyn. She tells Robyn she and her husband, Lucas, have a private box and offers to let Robyn clean her pants privately. They offer Robyn a drink. Robyn wants to leave but feels woozy. Donna and Lucas forcefully remove Robyn from the arena under the guise that she's drunk.<br/><br/>Wayne worries that Robyn hasn't returned from the bathroom and calls her name outside the door. Wayne works with the guard and finds images of two people putting Robyn in an SUV on security cameras. Their avoidance of security measures makes Wayne believe they've done this in the past.<br/><br/>Wayne and his ex-wife, Pam, go to the police for help. But they assume Robyn ran away to be with friends. Pam permits Wayne to do anything to anyone to get Robyn home safely. He knows they are on borrowed time. Can Wayne save Robyn before she's lost forever?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this film gives an all-too-familiar sad tale of human trafficking and the police's slow response. The plot takes a moment to build because it focuses on Robyn and Wayne's strained relationship. This build allows the viewers to understand how Donna quickly lured Robyn away. The actors gave a stellar performance and allowed the audience to connect with each character. Also, the movie explains why some victims return to these horrific circumstances. The sets have noticeable budget constraints, but the well-choreographed fights ease those shortcomings. It takes time to build the climax, but the drop to the conclusion is fast-paced and exciting.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

The winner gets an all-expenses-paid vacation for them and a guest. Carlos loves the idea and asks them to prepare it by Monday.<br/><br/>Emilia, Jason, and Fredricks meet their guests. NYPD Detective Bobby won a previous game with the fastest time of 32 minutes. He brought his brother, investment banker Davis, to the island.

Mystery author Cassandra Cormwell is attending with her husband, Ted. And Janie is bringing her new beau, Texas oil tycoon James.<br/><br/>Everyone gathers for Emilia and Jason to give them the rules. Anyone could be the murderer or the victim.

    "mtitle": "The Last Woman Who Lived Here",
    "review": "Joel and Charlotte tour a home with their realtor, Trudie. Charlotte enters the backyard while Joel discusses the price with Trudie because it's far below the market value. Trudie tells Joel that the last owner, Vanessa, died on the property after falling down the stairs. Joel asks Trudie to keep that information from Charlotte when she decides to buy the house.<br/><br/>Joel and Charlotte move into their home and receive a party invite. Charlotte recognizes the man on the invitation. It's Rick, a wealthy philanthropist. Rick warmly greets them and welcomes them to the neighborhood. They meet Rick's wife, Serena, and Serena bonds with Charlotte. Serena and Charlotte laugh over wine when Laurie approaches. Laurie asks Charlotte why she bought the murder house. Laurie's husband, Ted, pulls Laurie away. Later, Charlotte demands Joel tell the truth. He tells her about Vanessa but says it was an accident. However, Charlotte can't let it go. She finds clues around their home alluding to a murder. Charlotte vows to uncover what happened to the last woman who lived there.<br/><br/>This movie is a worthwhile mystery. However, there wouldn't be a movie if Trudie had someone deep-clean the home before selling it. Charlotte finds blood stains on the floor, broken glass, and a word etched on the wall. The writer attempted to add a twist, but it's a classic for Lifetime fans. It's Charlotte's sleuthing skills that lock you into the plot. Although the conclusion is bland, you will love discovering the truth with her.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Prudence is the advisor of Duke William of Glasswick. He calls her to his office to discuss his health. William hasn't felt well lately and believes it's time to pick his successor. Prudence balks at the thought because William doesn't have an heir. The next in line for the throne is his cousin, Lord Allistair. Prudence digs through the royal documents and finds a United States marriage license for William and a woman named Dorothy. Prudence looks up Dorothy online and discovers she has a son, Johnny, who looks exactly like William. Prudence goes to the United States to find Johnny.<br/><br/>Johnny is an auto mechanic who can fix anything. He joins his friends for karaoke. Johnny finishes his song with flair and sees Prudence standing over him. They walk to a corner to talk privately. She tells Johnny that he is the rightful heir to Glasswick and gives Johnny a first-class ticket. Johnny doesn't want to see his father because his father hasn't shown interest in him or his mother. Prudence leaves.<br/><br/>Johnny visits Dorothy. She explains that she met and married William after dating for three weeks. However, his father demanded that William return home. She found out she was pregnant after William left. She wrote William a letter, but he never responded.

Johnny agrees to stay if she beats him in a game of darts. Prudence crushes him, and Johnny returns. He will give the royal life a chance but doesn't notice Prudence is falling in love with him. Will this reluctant royal take the throne?<br/><br/>This funny twist on a classic plot allows the male lead to be the person overwhelmed with the crown. He maturely states his issues with William, allowing space for connection. William realizes his disconnection with his son extends to his people. You will laugh when Johnny confronts Allistair. Allistair hides behind his title with smug condemnation, but Johnny won't allow it. He uses his streetwise attitude to put Allistair in his place.
