    "review": "Bernie films herself applying makeup and posts it for her followers. Her momager, Leah, is proud Bernie's engagement is up but doesn't know why Bernie hasn't gotten more followers. Leah thinks Bernie should separate the brand from Bernie's boyfriend, Zak. Leah worries a breakup could tarnish Bernie's brand. Bernie defends her relationship and leaves for school.<br/><br/>Bernie meets with her friends, Hana and Jaz. Later, Bernie meets Zak by his locker. She reminds him to pick up the balloons for their prom-posal. She explains that she needs companies to see it and attract more followers. She desires to be an influencer.<br/><br/>Bernie meets with Zak at their planned location. But he forgot the balloons. They get into an argument, and Zak breaks up with Bernie. She checks social media and sees Hana's latest post. Hana calls Zak her hero and kisses him. Bernie's followers come to her defense and call out Zak's poor behavior, including her number 1 supporter Mason Michael. He gives her encouragement and compliments in her direct messages. Then, he asks for private content for a fee. Bernie charges Mason $100 for a photo and sends him a cute image.<br/><br/>NYU accepts Bernie's admission, and she jumps for joy. However, her dreams deflate when she finds a stack of past-due bills in Leah's glove compartment. Mason asks for more explicit content, and Bernie relents to get money for school. Bernie gets called to the principal's office but finds Zak waiting for her in the hall. He apologizes, asks her to prom, and records it. Bernie accepts and posts the video. While her followers love it, Mason rages.<br/><br/>Mason locates Bernie's school and interrupts Zak's foul shot. Bernie makes an excuse to speak to Mason privately. Mason doesn't regret his interruption and professes his love for Bernie. When she refuses, he slips a note in her pocket. Hana sees the altercation and gives Mason Bernie's address.<br/><br/>Bernie returns home and finds Mason's letter. He threatens to release her explicit pictures if she doesn't leave Zak for him. Bernie panics alone when she hears a knock at the door. Mason points a gun at her. After a battle, Leah shoots Mason, smashes Mason's phone, and concocts a lie for Bernie to offer the police. Bernie posts about the event, and it goes viral. Bernie gets more followers and brand deals, and Leah's salon obtains more customers. Both soar on cloud nine until sex, lies, and videotape bring Bernie's world down.<br/><br/>Bernie and Leah have an interesting mother-daughter dynamic. Leah doesn't have boundaries to protect their relationship while acting as Bernie's mom. Bernie balances her rising career with high school antics. Bernie doesn't see that Hana is manipulative and envious. Viewers shouldn't change the channel after Leah shoots Mason. That moment is the midpoint of this film. This film isn't a story about a teen and her stalker. It's about the facade around social media. This film would be a better choice for an after-school special.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Abby and her daughter, Zoe, go to the bathroom, but Zoe walks away. Abby frantically looks for Zoe but can't find her. Someone took Zoe. Abby and her husband, Mitch, appear on the evening news and plead for Zoe's safe return. After six months, the police have zero leads. Mitch sees Abby is falling apart and asks Abby to attend a grief support group. He explains that it's a support group for parents with missing children, so she goes.<br/><br/>Mitch and Abby meet Dolores at the support group. Someone kidnapped Dolores's daughter two decades ago. She offers a friendly ear if Abby wants to talk. Days later, Abby remembers taking photos with Zoe. She finds a clue to Zoe's kidnapper, but Detective Doyle says it isn't definitive. Abby chooses to follow the clues on her own. Abby won't let anyone stop her, including Mitch. She lies to Mitch and goes on a mission to find Zoe. Will Abby survive?<br/><br/>This movie is a slow burn to a twist ending you won't care about. The plot drags, the characters are uninspired, and the climax isn't captivating. This film isn't fit for background noise, and Lifetimers should skip it.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Although Natalie will start at Carnegie Mellon University in 6 weeks, she will move to her new apartment now to settle and make roots. Natalie's neighbors throw her a going-away surprise party before she leaves.<br/><br/>Natalie arrives and meets the handyman, Mark, but he is too busy for small talk. She meets Sylvia, the H.O.A. president, in the hallway, and Sylvia states a few of the rules to Natalie. Natalie sleeps after a long moving day.<br/><br/>Natalie asks C.M.U. to start work early. However, they say no. So, she leaves to explore the neighborhood and finds an argument in the lobby. Chuck can't stop sneezing, and Hector has issues with Liz. Natalie wants to help, but Mark tells her to ignore it. She walks to a local diner, and Vero stops her to ask if she will pledge to the Walk to End Alzheimer's. Since Vero is a Carnegie student, Natalie decides to volunteer her time. Vero pitches to Mark, but Mark dismisses her while Natalie talks to Vero's lead, Linda.<br/><br/>Natalie sits at the diner and meets the charming owner, Drea. Natalie explains to Drea that Mark is cold, but Drea defends Mark. She says Mark is kind, but he has to trust you first. Natalie assumes the neighbors are all like Mark. Her old neighbor, Tobias, calls to check on her. Natalie airs her frustrations, and Tobias reminds Natalie that she turned their building into a community. Natalie vows to do the same for her new building and finds a surprising ally in Mark. What will it take for these strangers to get along?<br/><br/>When viewers hear those three dreaded letters, H.O.A., they will cringe. You will assume the H.O.A. will be the problem in this building. However, the tenants yell. But no one will listen. First, Natalie works with them individually, but it falls apart when she leaves them alone for an hour. Then, she follows Mark's advice and gets to the root cause. The heartbreaking subplot is between Natalie and Linda. She encourages Natalie to leaf peep and date Mark. Also, she teaches Natalie to be sporadically selfish. This movie will entertain, inspire, educate, and make your tummy grumble. So, get your turkey butternut squash and pear pie for this Hallmark gem.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jo warns her friend, co-worker Alicia, that Alicia's check will be late. The system couldn't match her social security number to Alicia's new name. Alicia understands with a smile and leaves for the evening.<br/><br/>Alicia arrives at her son's school, but he isn't there. She calls her sister, Kam, in a panic. Later, Alicia finds Malcolm with his friends in an abandoned lot. Malcolm admits he turned his phone off to avoid her calls. She yells at her son but buys him sneakers to apologize. Malcolm looks inside the shoes and finds an AirTag. He refuses to wear them.<br/><br/>Across town, Victor pays a visit to his friend, Stevie. Stevie can't believe Victor is out of jail after doing eight years of a 15-year stint. Victor reminds Stevie that he didn't snitch on their crime. Now, Victor wants his cut. Stevie tells Victor he doesn't have it. After damaging Stevie's client's property, Victor leaves with Stevie's wife's diamond bracelet and Stevie's car.<br/><br/>Victor stalks Kam and steals her phone. He uses her phone to locate Malcolm. Victor approaches his son at a basketball court, but Malcolm doesn't recognize him. He pulls out an old family photo to prove he is Malcolm's father. Malcolm welcomes Victor with open arms and brings him home.<br/><br/>Alicia walks through the door and asks whose car is in the driveway. She goes to Malcolm's doorway and stands in horror, seeing Victor playing video games with Malcolm. Victor smiles and hands Alicia a diamond bracelet. He promises he is a changed man and invites Alicia and Malcolm to dinner so she can see the new Victor. Alicia runs to her room and calls Kam. Kam reminds Alicia that Victor broke her nose and bruised her ribs in the past. Alicia says she will go out with Victor to appease him, but nothing more.<br/><br/>Alicia, Victor, and Malcolm eat dinner and return. Alicia turns down a kiss but allows Victor to hug her. Victor asks for a second date, but Alicia dodges the questions. After he leaves, Alicia runs inside and tells Malcolm to pack. She walks her bag to the car, and Victor is there. He forces Alicia into the car, goes inside, and tells Malcolm they will return soon. He sees a crate by the trash bin and gets a horrendous idea. He will bury her alive and take Malcolm. Alicia doesn't know that being buried alive is the first disgusting thing Victor will put her through in 24 hours.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, this movie will strike fear in your heart. Alicia met Victor at a young age and suffered through domestic violence. Alicia and Victor are between the reconciliation and calm stage in the cycle of abuse. Lifetime viewers must restrain their frustration towards Malcolm. Alicia never explained their past. Alicia believes she can control Victor's anger until the dinner. She gets a flash of the old Victor and wants to run. While it's easy to point out mistakes, viewers mustn't forget Alicia's fear, hope, and strength.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Shae and Chris arrive in Shae's hometown to look at the tourist traps. Before their tour, Shae takes Chris to meet retired ranger Larry. Larry was friends with Shae's father, Jim, before Jim died. She tells Larry she wants to sell Jim's house, and Larry blames Chris. Shae and Chris look around Shae's old bedroom, and he finds her childhood diary. He finds a picture of her former high school boyfriend, Burke. They arrive at a parking lot, park their car, and grab their gear. Then, Ranger Burke sees them and approaches. Shae dislikes the direction of the conversation and ends it. She leaves and hikes with Chris.<br/><br/>Burke follows Chris and Shae as they walk through the park and sees another woman following them. He deduces they are heading towards a bench and checks out the area. Burke spots a ring box. Burke grabs the ring box from the bench.<br/><br/>Chris arrives at the bench but can't find the ring. He tells Shae to wait and sprints away. Chris uncovers the woman, Rachel, and asks about the ring's location. Rachel is Chris's photography student, and he hired her to take candid proposal images. Rachel tells him that she put it on the bench. But she saw a ranger in the area, and he may have it. Chris demands Burke return the ring, but Burke denies having it. Rachel says she has pictures as proof, and Burke lunges for her camera. They fight, and Burke pushes Chris off a bluff. Rachel runs away. Burke chases after and shoots her. Then, he puts the ring on Rachel's finger and takes her phone. Burke finds Shae looking for Chris and tries to deter her. But it doesn't work. Shae is determined to find the man she loves, even if it kills her. Or Burke does.<br/><br/>Every guy in this movie is disgusting. Chris is insecure about images in Shae's diary from the 6th grade. Larry thinks he has a say in how Shae lives her life. And Burke is a bully and creep. Shae and Rachel should run from all of them. The shining light in the movie is Shae's determination. Locals Tiffany and Finn seem out of place but make a necessary appearance later. This film is 30 minutes shorter than the others, but that time would've been a waste. This picture grabs your attention, but the men are cringy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
