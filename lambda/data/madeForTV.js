    "review":"Angela materializes with a mission from her boss and a stellar resumé.  Principal Bruce thinks her credentials go beyond their needs and reminds Angela that the guidance counselor job is temporary. A teacher walks into the interview demanding Bruce help him with an unruly student, Cody. Angela talks sense into Cody, but he doesn't want to go to counseling.  Bruce gives Cody a choice: counseling or detention.  In counseling, Cody tells Angela he doesn't need a fix. Angela asks Cody to call his dad, Jeff, but Jeff doesn't answer.  So, Angela walks Cody home to meet Jeff in person.  Angela discovers that Cody nor Jeff have been the same since their matriarch, Melissa, died.  When Jeff gave up on the restaurant, Cody lost again.  Angela asks Jeff about his extended family, but they are spread out all over the world.  And Jeff and Cody were Melissa's family.  Angela must repair this fractured family, or Cody's world will fall apart.  Lucky for Cody, Angela's an angel.<br/><br/>Based on the T.V. show, this movie is a jumping point to a holiday series and stays close to the original.  As Angela works her magic, she makes miracles.  Although, it will feel as if she doesn't know her boss's plan either. At times, Angela's interference leaves Cody with a broken heart. Angela doesn't give Cody what he wants.  Instead, she gives him the tools to cope.  And that will last a lifetime.  Be ready for the next movie in this series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Abby packs up her desk and says goodbye to her job working for the district attorney to join the most prestigious law firm in the state.  Among her farewells is Abby's estranged husband, Damon. While saying goodbye to Damon, Abby gets a phone call.  Abby and Damon's daughter, Sophie, got suspended again. When Abby gets Sophie home, Abby gets a text message.  Her father, Everett, died, and the police suspect it was murder. Abby tells Sophie that she doesn't talk to that side of her family since college.  Abby puts that behind her and focuses on her new job.  On her first day, Abby's boss, Brice, gives her their top priority case. The client is her estranged sister, Adrianna.  After Everett's nurse, Bianca, stated she saw Adrianna in Everett's room, the police arrested Adrianna. Now Abby has to face her past, rumors, and a murderer.<br/><br/>Now, this movie is one to watch with two twists.  The first is a bit predictable, but the second is not, even for the most experienced Lifetime viewer.  It does take a moment to grab your attention because viewers start to see the typical Lifetime setup: bratty teen, cheating husband, and estranged family.  With preconceived notions that you know the movie, it's easy to walk away.  But that would be a mistake.  When the story gets going, you won't be able to look elsewhere.  DVR this movie so you can skip the commercials.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Gingerbread Miracle",
    "review":"Mia moved back to her parent's home with the hopes of being there for six months.  Two years later, she is still there with her sister, Sydney.  She applies to big law firms and uses the Casillas Panadería as her office.  Legend says if a member of the Casillas family makes you a personalized gingerbread cookie, you can make a wish, and it will come true.  The owner, Luis, makes Mia a red briefcase cookie.  She makes a wish 'to guide me where I'm supposed to be' and eats it.  Then, Luis tells Mia he wants to sell the Panadería to someone who will keep it a family business.<br/><br/>Mia goes through the paperwork, and the telephone rings.  It's Alex, Luis's nephew.  Alex got permission to work remotely and decided to come into town for Christmas. Before she left for school, she put a letter in Alex's pocket professing her love.  But he never called. Alex comes home and steps right into the kitchen. Then, Alex discovers that Luis is selling the Panadería and offers his services.  Mia tells Luis that she doesn't need another lawyer looking over the paperwork, but Alex wants to approve the buyers based on their integrity.  What started as a marriage of convenience becomes a launching pad for love, only if they would talk to each other.<br/><br/>If Alex and Mia acted like adults, this movie wouldn't have a plot. With communication being essential, it's also an adult decision.  It becomes frustrating that childish behavior is the premise of a movie.  With that aside, the thought of wishing on gingerbread is charming for the holidays.  This predictable film is background noise to the holiday season.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Liz and her daughter, Hannah, go back to Portside after Liz's father, Dennis, injures himself saving a child. When they arrive at the docks, Liz sees her old friend Luke.  Liz inquires about the 25,000 dollar grand prize banners.  Luke tells Liz that the town added the grand prize to their Festival of Lights boat decorating contest to draw in more tourists. But he tells Liz that Dennis could never enter with his boat.  Liz stops in her tracks because Dennis said he sold his boat.<br/><br/>Liz looks at it, and it is in shambles. He never got around to selling, but he will soon.  In the morning, Liz walks around town for Christmas decor for Dennis's home.  Then, Hannah sees the house in a real estate flyer.  Dennis ran late on his payments because of his wife's medical bills.  If he doesn't come up with the money, he will lose his home. Liz has a settlement check coming, but it's not enough to cover the debt.  Liz gets a crazy idea to enter the Christmas contest.  If Liz gets the boat together, she could save Dennis's home.  But Liz will need help.  Good thing she has Hannah to convince Luke to join their team.<br/><br/>This movie feels like the stereotype Hallmark movie, which it is, but it's the last 5 minutes that will make you reach for the tissues.  A loving tribute to Christmas, a family, love, and a boat sail bring a family and relationship together. With a charming child softening a Scrooge, this film gives you all the feels in a predictable format.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
