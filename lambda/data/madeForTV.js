  "mtitle":"Her Fiancé's Double Life",
  "review":"Darcy and her family will meet her sister's fiancé, Thomas, for the first time this weekend. Kristina, the family housekeeper, sees Darcy sitting outside in her car. Kristina coaxes Darcy out of her car with a lollipop. Darcy walks up to the front door but hears the unfamiliar sound of laughing coming from the backyard. Her family is chatting with Thomas and having a good time. However, something about Thomas doesn't sit well with Darcy. She asks her friend, Marta, to do an in-depth search. Marta couldn't locate Thomas, but she found a man matching his description with two dead wives. The man disappeared after the life insurance paid him. Darcy worries this man is Thomas, but can she get her family to believe her before it's too late?<br/><br/>First, Darcy's family starts off toxic. They believe she is jealous of her sister, Brea, and Douglas snaps at her every chance he gets. Second, Thomas talks too much, especially during the killing. However, he does give Darcy his motive for coming after Brea and killing his other two wives. And Lindsay Hartley got the Drew Barrymore treatment for this movie. So, Lifetimers shouldn't get too attached. While this movie feels like an old-school Lifetime drama, it falls short. Hopefully, part two will be better.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Senior Kaylee is the president of her sorority and selected her little sister, Winter, for the year. Winter looks around Kayley's room and sees an article about Kaylee's mother, Vera. In 2007, Vera won a sexual harassment suit against her boss, Mr. Lancaster. Before security threw Mr. Lancaster out of his office, he committed suicide. Kaylee gives Winter a gift to bond them, and Kaylee's best friend, Lori, enters with a present for Winter. Winter opens the baby items, and Kaylee explains that Lori is making fun of her for dating Wally. Wally is an 18-year-old frat student and three years younger than Kaylee.<br/><br/>Kaylee meets with her friends at the track to exercise, and Wally and his frat big brother, Chase, join them. Wally gives Kaylee an anniversary present but gets surprised by Vera walking onto the field. Wally introduces himself as Wally Lancaster. Vera and Kaylee discover Wally is Mr. Lancaster's son. Wally becomes overwhelmed with emotions and leaves.<br/><br/>Chase convinces Kaylee to attend a Toga Party thrown by his frat. Kaylee hopes Wally appears because he hasn't spoken to her in a week. Kaylee brings Chase bourbon to celebrate his 21st birthday, and Chase offers it to Wally. Later, Wally and Chase argue and get into a tug-a-war over Kaylee. Wally knocks into electrical equipment, falls into the pool, and gets electrocuted. He dies instantly.<br/><br/>Kaylee and Lori meet the new house mother, Caroline, before attending Wally's funeral. Vera goes to the gravesite to support Kaylee, and Wally's mom, Sabrina, snaps. Later, Kaylee picks flowers to put on Wally's grave, and Chase startles her. Detectives question Chase because Wally had GHB in his system, and Chase wants them to get their stories straight. Kaylee believes it was an unfortunate accident and tells Chase she will inform the police of that too. Kaylee sees a message written on the bathroom mirror after taking a shower. It says, 'We Know You Killed Wally.' With someone accusing her, Kaylee must discover what happened to Wally.<br/><br/>This movie covers a lot in two hours. Viewers get a poolside fight, graveyard smackdown, and battling sisters. The petty squabbles between Kaylee and her sorority slow the film's pace, but it picks up when Kaylee talks to Vera, Chase, or Sabrina. Of course, Kaylee makes foreseen Lifetime mistakes, but you can cross those off on your bingo card. This movie is a soap opera with Greek life, GHB, and death. It's fun to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"A View To Kill For",
  "review":"Molly and her husband, Charlie, meet with her lawyer because the lawyer has information about her father. Molly's mother, Sarah, and her father, Lionel, ended their relationship before Molly was born. Molly started the search for Lionel and hoped to know him. Unfortunately, Lionel died six months ago but left Molly a substantial inheritance worth millions and a house.<br/><br/>Molly and her family arrive at the massive home and wave to their neighbor, Justine, but she doesn't reciprocate. Their realtor, Rebecca, greets them. A warning scrawled on the wall frightens Molly and Charlie during their walk-through. Rebecca believes it was Lionel's fiancé, Darla. Lionel wrote Darla out of the will and left everything to Molly without telling Darla.<br/><br/>Molly goes to the local café, and Theresa calls Molly over to her table.

As Molly walks away, Darla enters and angrily confronts Molly about acquiring the home. Theresa confesses that Lionel was afraid of a woman after his money. She will give Molly more information later. Molly gathers herself in the hallway and hears a scream from the ballroom. Theresa is dead at her table.

Instead, it's the fuel she needs to investigate who is threatening her family and why.<br/><br/>Molly and Charlie ignore the fake blood on the wall, break-ins, and leaking gas. However, Molly finally pays attention when Theresa dies. This movie gives the viewers plenty of suspects. Experienced Lifetimers will spot the suspect within the first half, but you won't care because this film is full of drama. You will beg for Molly to slap someone's smug face. Viewers will come for the mystery, but stay for the tea.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Stella wakes up and dreads going to work because she wants to celebrate 4/20 the proper way. She got some product, Pink Hashmina, from her connect Layla. And Stella will sell it to Tick Tock after work. Tick Tock is dangerous and works for the most notorious drug queen pin in Atlanta, Madam X.. Stella says goodbye to her roommate, Blaize, and goes to the salon to do makeup for a wedding.<br/><br/>Darcy gives herself another daily affirmation. She lives life by the rules but suffers from performance anxiety. She comes to work and gets a demanding bride, but nothing compares to Stella's criticism.

She finds Darcy at brunch, and they fight in the middle of the restaurant. Stella informs Darcy that Tick Tock will kill her if she doesn't deliver the drugs. Stella wants Darcy to come and explain her actions to Layla. Darcy says no but succumbs to Stella's threats. These two will embark on a wild adventure that includes hit-and-runs, sex dungeons, edibles, parkour, and a police chase.<br/><br/>The only way to describe this film is dumb-funny. It follows the rules of How High and Half-Baked. The plot gets crazier and more elaborate with each step in Stella and Darcy's journey. When the story settles down, you find they have insecurities and dreams. They learn from each other and grow. Don't watch this movie expecting Oscar-worthy performances. Viewers should expect swearing, smoking, and hallucinations.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Chaos on the Farm",
  "review":"Kathy meets Jessica at the grave of Jessica's mother, Betty. Betty died over a year ago, leaving a substantial inheritance to Jessica and Betty's sister, Susan. Kathy sees Jessica is deep in the grieving process. Kathy thinks Jessica needs family. She asks Jessica to drive to the country and deliver Susan's check.<br/><br/>Jessica goes home to her boyfriend, Sam, and updates him about the check.

She wants to connect and understand them before handing them their inheritance. So Sam chooses to go to Susan and Lawrence's farm with Jessica and unplug. They have no idea about the chaos that awaits them.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, viewers see someone on a farm die, but few will know how it ties into the plot. Then, Sam and Jessica fall into the Lifetime traps. The farm has limited cell service, no WiFi, and is very remote. Later, they find an answering machine with dozens of messages from Kathy. Soon, the audience will put it together and see the dark cloud looming over the farm. The second half of the movie is Sam and Jessica's escape. This intriguing movie attempts to be scary, but it won't keep you up at night.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
