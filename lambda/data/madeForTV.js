   "mtitle":"V.C. Andrews' Ruby",
   "review":"Ruby resides on the bayou with her grandmère, Catherine, and accompanies Catherine to perform voodoo rituals.  Ruby loves school, her boyfriend, Paul, and painting.  While selling items on the side of the road, Dominic, the owner of a gallery, comes up to Catherine and buys all of Ruby's paintings. When Catherine sees Ruby and Paul together, Catherine tells Ruby to stop dating him.  When Ruby doesn't listen, Catherine tells her the truth.  Paul is her mother's first child, which makes him Ruby's half-brother. Later, Ruby gets an envelope with money from Dominic because he sold some of her paintings.  Catherine tells Ruby to hide the money from her grandpère, Jack, in her jewelry box.  With a cough, Catherine decides to tell Ruby the truth about her family by showing Ruby a picture hidden in her bible. The image is of her older twin sister, Giselle.  Ruby's mother, Gabrielle, fell in love with a married man, Pierre, whose wife could not have children.  When Gabrielle gave birth, she didn't know she was pregnant with twins.  Jack sold the first baby to Pierre, and Pierre left before Gabrielle gave birth to Ruby.  When Jack tried to sell Ruby, Catherine threatened to kill him.  The day after giving birth, Gabrielle died.  Sadly, these are Catherine's last words, and Ruby buries her.  After the funeral, Jack drops by and talks about Ruby marrying Buster.  Ruby throws Jack out, but he comes back with a chain.  Jack chains Ruby to the bed and invites Buster over. When Buster enters Ruby's room, she chokes him out with the chain.  And Ruby does the same to Jack and escapes.  Ruby gets a one-way ticket to Pierre's home, and Ruby dreams of a better life with her father.  She has no idea she is running into evil.<br/><br/>Based on V.C. Andrews' Ruby novel, this movie has all the twists and turns you expect from Lifetime's favorite author.  Congratulations to Lifetime for finding talented, real-life twins to play Giselle and Ruby.  Instead of using a distracting split-screen, these gifted women allow you to focus on the captivating story.  Viewers will wait in anticipation for V.C. Andrews' Pearls in the Mist.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Deadly Excursion: Kidnapped from the Beach",
  "review":"Samantha and David run a successful restaurant and work to piece their lives back together after their daughter, Ellie, almost fell prey to human traffickers.  Ellie calls because her team won the state beach volleyball competition.  Now, the team is going to the national competition in Florida, and she wants to go.  Samantha says no because one of her captors, Ian, is still on the loose. David thinks Ellie should go but only under their supervision. Once in Florida, David calls Jensen to inform Jensen they left Texas, and Jensen is not happy.  A few days ago, a male matching Ian's description tried to board a plane, bound to Florida, with a fake passport. After Ellie's first tournament win, the family goes out for a celebratory dinner.  They want to compliment the chef when César and Miguel come over.  The pair make the family feel uncomfortable, so they rebuke their kindness.  The family leaves the restaurant and jumps into a hotel shuttle. The driver works for César.  During Ellie's kidnapping last year, $250,000 of César's money went missing. Since Samantha funded and opened a restaurant the same year, César and Miguel assume Samantha stole the money.  César ordered his son, Miguel, to find Samantha and report back. While watching the family, Miguel's obsession for Ellie grew.  Now, Miguel will have to choose between César and Ellie while Ellie and her family fight to stay alive.  They will get help in the most unlikely place.<br/><br/>This Deadly Excursion sequel packs more intensity than the first. Like Miss Bala, Samantha doesn't know who she can trust, and her captor does everything in his power to appear charming.  She knows César is a viper waiting to strike. Based on the ending, there will be a part three.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Deep Blue Nightmare",
  "review":"James calls his daughter, Sarah, before he throws away her mother's painting tools.  Sarah likes them, but she can't think about painting after losing her mom. Then he asks about her modeling shoot.  Her photographer and ex-boyfriend, Jason, wants to go to a bay to get some beautiful shots of her surrounded by nature.  James, a former Civil Air Patrol, tells Sarah to check the weather before they head out. She agrees and meets up with Jason and his make-up artist and new girlfriend, Meghan.  Jason heard about a new island that formed after a natural disaster.  He wants to use the new island for his photoshoot.  Sara and Meghan begrudgingly agree to the location change. While Jason takes Sarah's photos in the water, Meghan, on the island, sees a shark in the water.  She screams to Jason and Sarah to come back, and Sarah makes it, but Jason dies.  Sarah calms herself and Meghan and calls James for help.  She tells him about the location change to an uncharted island and the shark attack. A King Tide is coming, and a shark riled up by human error will put them in the water and in the shark's path.<br/><br/>First, this movie is the perfect Shark Week movie and reminiscent of The Shallows. Second, the film gives you a sense of panic, but not about the shark. Subpar CGI diminishes the shark attack fear, a la Sharknado.  The plot won't always entertain you, but you will learn something new about the water, animals, and the importance of a solar phone charger.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "mtitle":"Deadly Dating Game",
  "review":"Shannon is a popular host for the radio show Love on the Air.  Her boss, Franklin, informs Shannon of her Radio Personality of the Year nomination. Her friend and producer, Hailey, thinks Shannon should start dating again.  Shannon believes she doesn't have the time, patience, or money to look for a date.  So, Hailey suggests Shannon asks her listeners to nominate the right guy for her. After some horrible dates, Shannon wants to call off the search.  Hailey believes Shannon is still in love with her ex-boyfriend, Gavin, the man that moved away and broke her heart.  Shannon gets back on the radio to tell the fans the search is over, but one caller asks Shannon to give it one more chance with her co-worker, Ian. Ian and Shannon have a tough lunch date because of two interruptions.  First is phone calls from Ian's job.  The second is Gavin.  He is back in town and still in love with Shannon.  Shannon and Ian make plans for a dinner date, and it is fabulous.  He walks her home, and they say goodbye, but not before making plans again.  The next day, Shannon gets horrible news, Ian died after being carjacked.  If that information isn't devastating enough, a radio caller taunts her.  The caller tells Shannon that Ian was the victim of a murder, and they did it. With a city-wide fan base, Shannon has no idea who could be targeting her.  But she could be the next victim on the killer's list.<br/><br/>With Shannon opening her life to the masses, it allows for a myriad of suspects to consider.  Also, the people in Shannon's life act suspicious when she is not around.  This list includes Gavin, Hailey, and Franklin.  Now, Lifetimers will guess the murderer before the plot exposes it, but it gives plenty of misdirects to throw you off track.  One of the best cinematic moments in the movie is the mash-up of feeding the stray cat and Ian's murder scene.  Without showing the bloody event, the sound effect from opening the cat food merges perfectly to give the killing impact.  Watch this when you have time to give it your full attention.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
