    "review":"Zack had a rough few years.  After his mother died of cancer, his father, Mike, left him and his brother, Dave.  Dave played high school football until a hit caused a career-ending injury.  Zack currently plays for the Bessemer High football team and looks in the stands for college scouts.  Coach Bill tells Zack to stay on the straight and narrow.  If Zack gets the team to state, college recruiters will come.<br/><br/>After a game, Zack hangs with his team and future rivals.  Zack attacks when an opposing team member makes a joke about Dave.  Someone hits Zack behind his knee, causing an ACL injury during the fight.  With surgery and rehabilitation, the injury will heal.  Dave comes up with a way to get Zack back into the game.  However, Zack will need to give himself to his higher power to find the strength in forgiveness.<br/><br/>This film is faith-based, but you don't feel overcome with the message.  Everyone gives Zack lessons on hope, faith, and redemption.  But it takes the most innocent person of his life to fall for Zack to give his life over to Christ.  There is a love story intertwined with the movie.  However, it allows Zack to air his grievances with God.  Otherwise, the love story has zero purpose in the plot.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
