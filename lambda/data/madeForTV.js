    "mtitle": "I Thought My Husband's Wife Was Dead",
    "review": "Pregnant Layla talks to her husband, Leo, on the phone while he is away for business. Layla ends the call and hears someone banging on her door. Shocked, Layla sees a homeless woman calling herself Leo's dead wife, Vikki. Through the doorbell camera, Vikki tells Layla she is alive and wants her life back. Vikki leaves and spends the night on a bathroom floor.<br/><br/>Vikki walks into Karing Salon for a job. So the owner, Kerin, offers Vikki a job in exchange for room and board while Vikki looks for a better position. Karin asks her to take a pregnant woman to the hospital because the woman is having complications. The woman, Layla, refuses Vikki's help until the pains worsen. Vikki drives Layla to the hospital.<br/><br/>The doctor puts Layla on bed rest, and Vikki drives Layla home. Vikki takes advantage of the situation and steals Layla's clothes and shoes. Vikki takes a nap on Layla's sofa and cooks after waking. Vikki jumps and lunges a knife when she hears a noise behind her. It's Leo, and she cuts him. He wants to know where Vikki has been.<br/><br/>Vikki explains that a man grabbed her while she was running in the woods five years ago. She calls him the monster. Then, he shot her and left her for dead. Vikki's father died before her kidnapping and left $80,000. She wants that money and one of Leo's cars to start over. Leo confesses that they are broke. Vikki demands the money by the end of the week or else. She takes cash from Leo's wallet and his car. Layla and Leo want Vikki out of their lives, but Vikki won't make it easy.<br/><br/>Based on Unmissing by Minka Kent, this movie is a visual chess game. Characters say things that feel trivial but return in the wrap-up. It will make viewers' heads spin. Layla is a greedy woman who purchases two of everything and knows their family's financial woes. Leo moved on from Vikki but traces of Vikki are in his restaurant in loving and disturbing ways. And Vikki is a forgotten woman scorned. You won't know who comes out on top until the last 3 minutes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Jazz Ramsey: A K-9 Mystery",
    "review": "Jazz Ramsey runs a K-9 institute after ending her career as a Search and Rescue firefighter. She gets a call from her best friend, Principal Sarah after class. Sarah requested Jazz's help with the Astor Academy for Girls Forensics Club. Jazz hasn't been to her alma mater in years. Before the club enters, Jazz keeps her K-9 trainee, Zeus, outside the room while she hides two human bones.<br/><br/>During the lecture, Jazz has Zeus search for the bones. He finds the first with ease but starts to scratch the carpet. She pulls up the carpet and finds a grate. Jazz shines a light into the grate and sees a dead body. She tells Sarah to stay out and call the police. Zeus uncovered a crime scene.<br/><br/>Jazz's ex-boyfriend, Detective Nick, sits in Sarah's office and questions them about discovering the body. Sarah believes it's her least favorite teacher, Mrs. Quinn. Months ago, Mrs. Quinn retired and never returned. As Nick interrogates Sara, Jazz worries Nick considers Sarah a suspect. However, Sarah wasn't alone in her resentment towards Mrs. Quinn. Jazz offers to help Nick and ensure Sarah stays off his suspect list. Can she find who killed Mrs. Quinn?<br/><br/>Based on The Secrets of Bones by Kylie Logan, this mystery is one of the darkest in Hallmark history, which makes it more compelling. Hallmarkies will use their sleuthing experience to find the most and least obvious suspects, but everyone will be wrong. The killer is in the details. This film starts slow, but the killer's reveal makes it all worth it. The story is solid and has room to grow with two other books in the series.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadly Estate",
    "review": "Hotel manager Zakiya checks Ron and his new wife, Valeria, into the Magnate Hotel. Ron booked two rooms and wants the key to the second, but Zakiya refuses to give it to him based on the law. Later, Ron's son, Astor, checks in with a younger woman, Phoenix, who is not Astor's wife.<br/><br/>Detectives George and Daniel collect evidence around an unknown woman's body in the woods. Detective George remembers the Magnate Hotel is within 25 miles and wants to question the staff about her. Zakiya offers to look at the hotel's guest logs, but her supervisor, Steven, stops her. He invites George to come into his office to talk privately.<br/><br/>Astor calls Zakiya to his room for a towel change. She finds them bloody and next to a gun. Before Zakiya exits, she crosses paths with Phoenix and sees bruising. Later, Phoenix runs to the front desk with a large bruise on her neck and begs for a new room. Before Zakiya can print the key, Astor slowly approaches. Zakiya lies for Phoenix, and Phoenix leaves with Astor.<br/><br/>Zakiya walks to Astor's room and hears Phoenix screaming. Zakiya uses her master key to open the door and witnesses Astor pointing a gun at Phoenix. Steven enters, and Astor lies. Steven forces Zakiya to return Astor's weapon and tells her to apologize for entering the room with a 'Do Not Disturb' on display. Zakiya quits.<br/><br/>George knocks on Zakiya's door, and she assumes he has more questions about the woman found in the woods. However, George wants to know why she was in Astor's room the night prior. Zakiya tells her side of the story, and George informs her that someone murdered Astor. Zakiya soon realizes George considers her a suspect. And Steven pointed them in her direction. George arrests Zakiya. Now, Zakiya must discover who framed her or spend the rest of her life in jail.<br/><br/>This movie attempts to be salacious but is predictable for experienced Lifetimers. The writers struggle to make the protagonist look like an intelligent woman. Zakiya is great with guests but consistently makes mistakes by trusting the wrong people and talking too much. Viewers should save this movie for a rainy day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Murder for Mortgage: Secrets on Maple Street",
    "review": "Alex and Carlee moved to Maple Street and got a deal on their house because the previous occupant, Mrs. Claremont, died by hanging. The residents of Maple Street don't hide their feelings about the cankerous and nosy Mrs. Claremont. They look forward to meeting the new couple. The wives invite Alex and Carlee for drinks, but Alex doesn't want to attend. However, Carlee answers yes for them.<br/><br/>Carlee mingles with Betsy, Katie, and Dina. They plan to spend more time together. But the men's side of the room isn't going well. Alex remains icy towards Scott and Roger. Carlee pleads with Alex to be kinder, but Alex wants to focus on their home, its previous owner's contents, and his new job. Carlee hears noises in the middle of the night and looks around the house. She sees someone with a mask briskly exit. Detective Vaughn looks around while interviewing Carlee and Alex. They state nothing is missing, but Carlee's concerns about the quiet neighborhood grow. She worries the intruder was after Mrs. Claremont, not them. Carlee digs into Mrs. Claremont's life and discovers her suicide may be murder. Can Carlee uncover the truth before the intruder finishes the job?<br/><br/>The next installment of the Secrets of Maple Street invites a new family to the block. However, this couple isn't squeaky clean. Alex and Carlee keep secrets from each other and a watchful eye on their neighbors. The townspeople berate Mrs. Claremont over her casket, and it's brutal. However, the script allows the viewers to see the dark side of Gladys Claremont. She kept her finger on the pulse of Maple Street while having a knife at their back. This series may not be a favorite, but the character development is compelling. The final scene will let the audience know there are more mysteries in the future.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "An Ice Palace Romance",
    "review": "Ken encourages his friend, Lori, to ask their boss, Maxine, to add Lori's name to the promotion list. To Lori's surprise, Maxine thinks Lori will be a perfect fit. However, Lori needs to add a newsworthy piece to her portfolio. Maxine heard that the Ice Palace, an ice skating rink in Lori's hometown, may close. Maxine wants Lori to return to Greenville and write the story. Lori rejects it and leaves Maxine's office.<br/><br/>Lori's sister, Susan, meets Ken and Lori for lunch. Ken updates Susan on Lori's decision to reject the story for a promotion. Susan makes Lori explain why. Lori was an Olympic hopeful and practiced at the Ice Palace. During the Olympic qualifier, Lori fell and lost her chance to join the USA team. Lori never skated again and became a journalist. Then, Susan gives them exciting news. Her husband's job gifted them a trip to Mexico for Christmas. Lori can't imagine Christmas in a winter climate. She accepts Maxine's offer.<br/><br/>Lori converses with a young girl, Zoe, who is messing with her ice skates. Zoe tells Lori that her dad, Mark, wants to start a clinic for ice skaters. Mark sits down and believes he recognizes Lori. But Lori dodges the question as they board the train to Greenville. Lori checks in to the local bed and breakfast and meets her camera person, Jen, at the Ice Palace. Jen offers to take Zoe around town after they meet the Ice Palace's owner, Mark.<br/><br/>Lori interviews Mayor June after Mark rejects her for the article. Lori discovers the ice rink's lease will expire soon unless Mark makes significant improvements to increase funding. A developer, Chad, made a counteroffer for the property. Chad bought another property for a new ice rink. Mark doesn't like the new location. Everyone knows the move will force Greenville to cancel its annual Christmas skating competition and ball. Lori convinces Mark to let her do a feel-good article about the Ice Palace to spark interest and investors. Mark agrees, but only if she helps Zoe skate. Can Lori and Mark save the Ice Palace, or will Lori's past continue to haunt her?<br/><br/>This movie gives viewers everything you expect and makes fun of itself. Viewers know the result of the love story, but the journey keeps you watching. Lori and Mark don't deny their attraction and maintain an honest dialog throughout most of the picture. And keep your eyes on Greenville's fairy godmother, Mayor June. Nothing gets past the sweet woman with power. This film was the best way to end Christmas in July.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
