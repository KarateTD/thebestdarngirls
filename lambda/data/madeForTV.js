    "mtitle":"Swindler Seduction",
    "review":"After attending a conference for work, Louisa and her friend, Brooke, go to an upscale bar. They discuss what to drink when a handsome stranger pays for two glasses of champagne. The stranger, Steve, tells them he is celebrating the sale of his company for $10 million and shows them the paperwork. The waiter comes with the bill, and it's over $1300. Steve looks for his jacket and notices it's gone. His wallet, phone, and keys were inside it. Steve tells Louisa he will pay her back if she covers the charge. Then, Louisa takes Steve back to her hotel room.<br/><br/>The two have a whirlwind romance, and Steve comes home with her. Steve buys cars for Louisa, Brooke, and Brooke's husband, Alex. Then, he offers to fly them to an event. Steve asks them to donate to his charity. Later, Alex looks up the charity online to pay and can't find Steve's name anywhere. They call Louisa to tell her about Steve, and she doesn't believe them. Steve is gone, and Louisa has the bill. After some coaching from her mother, Louisa refuses to be a shrinking violet and decides to hunt Steve down and make him pay for his crimes. But Steve's identity won't be his only surprise in her investigation.<br/><br/>This story would be hard to believe if viewers haven't heard it several times. Con artists run romance scams to get money, information, or property from their marks. And the movie covers two types. First, the long con, it's where the manipulator pretends to date the victim for weeks, months, or years. Next is the quickie-and-go. The swindler steals items before the victim wakes up. Also, women and men can be a victim of a scam. With so many romance scam stories, Lifetime could pull from one to make a movie instead of twisting a plot to make something more sensational.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Bad Nanny",
    "review":"Remy's publisher, Tony, calls to celebrate with Remy. Her book, based on her daughter, Ella, has a publication date. Remy marvels at the first printed copy in her hands but leaves work to interview a new nanny.<br/><br/>Remy gets home to see Kendra sitting on her doorstep. The interview goes well, but Remy wants Ella to have the final say. So Remy asks Kendra to stay the night and spend time with Ella. After one night, Ella says she likes Kendra and wants Remy to hire her. Remy welcomes Kendra into her home and believes everything will be ok. But she is wrong. Kendra has a lifelong score to settle and wants everything Remy has, including her family and money.<br/><br/>This movie is the classic tale of revenge that viewers remember from the 90s. As Kendra talks about her mother and struggles, you can piece together exactly what she is doing and why. While the conniving is superb, the body count is low. When you watch, don't be surprised if you countdown to when Kendra takes out Jack. Unlike most Lifetime movies, the conclusion explains how Kendra stayed under the radar for years. It's the finality of the ending that makes this movie entertaining.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Naomi and Simon ask a server to bring champagne to celebrate their announcements. First, they want their best friends, Jack and Barrett, to be the best man and maid of honor at their wedding. Next, they are moving up their engagement party and wedding to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the day they met.<br/><br/>Ten years ago, Naomi took Barrett to one of Jack's concerts, and Barrett dismissed Jack and his pop music, especially his hit song. Jack heard her comments and expressed she couldn't write something if she tried. Jack's manager, Simon, stepped in and offered to find Naomi something she could eat. And that's when Naomi and Simon met. However, Jack and Barrett have been at odds since that day. Jack worries that Barrett will nitpick over every detail and write everything in her notebook. Barrett worries that Jack won't take anything seriously. But they promise to put Naomi and Simon first.<br/><br/>Barrett plans the engagement party at Jack's home and gives him one job: the music. Then, Barrett gets an idea. Jack is a musician, and the happy couple loves his music. So she asks Jack to play. Jack hasn't played on stage in years, but Jack agrees to do it if Barrett sings with him.<br/><br/>Simon and Naomi think the best wedding gift Jack and Barrett can give them is a performance at their wedding. Jack isn't sure what to sing, but Naomi believes it should be an original song. Jack hasn't written anything in years, but Barrett is an English professor that writes poetry. Jack and Barrett agree to write an original song and perform it at the wedding for their friends. They will discover each other and themselves in their collaboration.<br/><br/>This musical tale is a slew of apologies wrapped in flashbacks. Viewers will see Barrett and Jack's first encounter through their viewpoints. Each perspective is hilarious and slanted in the narrator's favor. As Jack and Barrett reveal their struggles, they understand that they misconstrued each other from the beginning. The songs are divine, and Jack's relationship with his son, Teddy, is open and honest.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love in Wolf Creek",
    "review":"Sam runs the Wolf Creek Wildlife Refuge with the support of the town. She doesn't know if she can keep it open without more money. Sam's sister, Sunny, posts a video of Sam saving eagle eggs, and the video goes viral. Olivia runs the tristate animal protection fund. Olivia wants to visit the refuge tomorrow to see if it meets their criteria. Sam happily accepts the visit but panics because it needs a lot of improvements before Olivia's walkthrough.<br/><br/>Sam goes to the Wolf Creek hardware store to rent a drill, but someone checked it out earlier and won't return it until the afternoon. The hardware store's owner, Marietta, offers to drive it to the refuge after the renter returns it, and Sam graciously accepts her offer. After Sam leaves, a man, Calvin, comes for bullets, but the store doesn't sell them because Wolf Creek is a conservation town. Austin, Marietta's nephew, suggests Calvin go to the next city, and Calvin leaves. Austin offers to go to the refuge and deliver the drill because Marietta has macular degeneration.<br/><br/>Austin comes to the refuge and sees Sam working with a distressed horse. He offers to help and calms the animal. Then, George, a local merchant, runs to Sam. He accidently hit a wolf on the road. He tried to help, but the wolf ran off. If the alpha dies, it will devastate the entire wolf pack. Sam must find, examine, and possibly save the wolf if needed. Austin decides to go with Sam to cover more ground. It will take longer because Calvin is hunting the same wolf. The wolf's pelt is worth more than anything, including Sam and Austin's lives.<br/><br/>This movie is an adventure story with romance in the background. While Austin helps Sam track the wolf, they help each other conquer their fears. With a movie that has caves, yellow jackets, and a terrifying leap of faith, it isn't all doom and gloom. The writer interjects moments of humor to ease the tension. While entertaining the audience, the plot gently stresses the importance of conservation and lets Sam and Austin fall in love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Sarah pretends to read an excerpt from her 2nd novel in the Isabella Kismet Cookies series. Her agent, Benny, tells the crowd of anxious tweens that Sarah selected the contest's winner. And the winner lives in her hometown of New Britain. Sarah isn't happy about going home to announce the winner, and Benny can see it on her face.<br/><br/>Years ago, Sarah made Kismet Cookies with her grandmother, Mia. They baked the cookies and gave them to people in need. But not for food, for love. Without Mia's knowledge, Sarah got a cookie and put it under her pillow. She dreamed of her best friend, Travis. Then ran to Travis's home to tell him and barged into his wedding. Sarah ripped up the recipe, left New Britain that day, and never returned. She wrote the first book, except the book's cookies make you into a superhero, not find true love.<br/><br/>Sarah arrives at Mia's home and gets a call from Benny. He reminds Sarah that she has until January 3rd to finish the book. In front of the town, Sarah announces that Jasmine is the winner. Jasmine runs on stage and hugs Sarah. Jasmine tells Sarah that her father is Santa and points to the Santa standing behind her. Santa smiles and calls Sarah by her childhood nickname because Santa is Travis. This time to write is colliding with Sarah's unresolved past. She keeps remembering her dream but puts that aside until Mia tells Sarah that Travis is divorced. Could Sarah's dream be true?<br/><br/>Based on The First Love Cookie Club by Lori Wilde, this movie follows the Hallmark setup. But it gets unintentionally scary. When Benny says the publisher wants to hire a ghostwriter, Travis drives Sarah to a cabin in the woods with no Wi-Fi and takes her phone. Lifetime fans will get a bad feeling for a moment, but then you remember it's Hallmark. This movie is a typical love story with Christmas, magic, and a cute kid.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
