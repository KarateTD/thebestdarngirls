    "review":"Within hours, Liv loses her job, her apartment, and her boyfriend.  She puts a post on social media to find a job that will get her out of New York immediately.  Any job will do.  Moments later, Cassidy replies with an intriguing opportunity.  Cassidy works for Hayden and Ava.  Hayden and Ava are a high-profile celebrity couple. Cassidy tells Liv they want to hire a surrogate to carry their child.  They will provide room and board.  When the baby is born, they will give Liv $150,000. Liv calls Cassidy and says she will do it.  She flies to LA and meets the couple.  While they are eccentric, they are kind, loving, and shower Liv with gifts.  So, Liv says yes to being their surrogate.  Soon, Liv is making trips to the doctor, making trips to the pharmacy, getting shots, and being weigh-ins.  Liv believes she is doing the right thing until she sees a fight between Hayden and Ava get physical and Ava's abuse of drugs and alcohol.  Cassidy attempts to assure Liv, but its too little too late.  Liv wants answers, but can she handle them?<br/><br/>Talk about a fun twist! With so many storylines involving surrogacy, it's hard to differentiate them.  However, this movie does just that.  It becomes a mystery with breadcrumbs throughout the story to give the viewers clues to Ava's motives. You will clutch your pearls when Ava and Hayden make Liv public enemy number one, they terminate the contract, and they punish Liv.  This movie is worth the watch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
