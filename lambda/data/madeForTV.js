His actions, or inactions, to Gabriella's pleas, are disturbing. Caroline uses guns, drugs, sob stories, and a sonogram to keep Tim in her clutches. This movie comes to the typical open-ended Lifetime solution but let's hope this movie ends with part 1.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Morning Show Mysteries: Murder Ever After",
    "review":"While getting a tumultuous introduction to her new co-host, Carlos, Billie gets a call from her friend, Maggie.  After receiving a distressing call from her father, Ryan, Maggie went to his home to check on him.  She found Ryan unconscious and on the floor with items belonging to his estranged wife, Phoebe. Once at Ryan's home, Billie surveys the clues.  She follows the clues to the basement and finds a skull. With Detective Wally along, the new head of homicide, Detective Sergeant Tyrell Pierce, looks in the basement for clues. And he finds a gold watch.  Tyrell and Wally ask Maggie about the timepiece, and she lies.  On the kitchen counter, Tyrell sees a photograph of a woman wearing the watch. Maggie explains the woman in the picture is Phoebe.  After a New Year's party, everyone believed that Phoebe left Ryan to be with Jay Messner. No one ever heard from Phoebe or Jay after the party.  Now, Tyrell and Wally believe Phoebe is the unidentified body in the basement, and Ryan killed her.  Billie must prove them wrong.  Good thing she has an unwanted partner.<br/><br/>Based on The Morning Show Mysteries by Al Roker, this film is a new start to an H.M.M. favorite.  With a new detective and a new host, it's hard not to sit up and pay attention.  Tyrell isn't a dumb cop that follows Billie's lead while pushing her to the side. Carlos is a reporter that loves ratings and exposure. Now Sleuthers don't worry because the show will give Ian the proper send-off for his character and daughter.  Also, the show says goodbye to Billie's restaurant. These changes will leave more opportunities for the viewer to get to know the show's staff.  This crime keeps you guessing, so have your murder board and labeler ready to narrow down the culprits.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Haley dresses for track practice when her mother, Michelle, gives her an early birthday gift: a pair of expensive sneakers. At practice, Haley sees her friends, Abby and Elaina, stretching and joins them. The three girls line up at the start line and run at their Coach Chris's command.  During the run, Abby gets into Haley's lane, forcing her to run into Elaina.  Both girls fall, and Abby wins.  Haley erupts, and Coach Chris calls Haley over.  After an incident, the school forced Haley to attend anger management classes. He tells Haley to try harder to keep her anger in check and ends practice. After Haley finishes her shower, she hears a loud bang and slowly enters the locker room to find the sound's origin.  She finds Abby on the ground with a head wound and calls for help. The medical examiner concluded that Abby's death wasn't an accident like previously believed.  It was murder.  They found a shoe print on Abby's face, and it matches the shoes Michelle got Haley.  Haley tells the detective she lost her shoes, and Michelle allows them to search her home.  The detective comes out of Haley's room with the shoes in an evidence bag. With the police's laser focus on her, Haley will investigate the crime to find Abby's killer.  Lucky for Haley that her ankle monitor is faulty.<br/><br/>It's not the mystery that keeps you on edge, but it's Haley's close calls and bursts of anger. The premise and mystery are good contenders, but the final fight scene is laughable.  If you decide to watch, you will have to pay attention but don't cancel your plans.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
