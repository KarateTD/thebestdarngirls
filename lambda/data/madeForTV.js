    "mtitle":"Janet Jackson",
    "review":"On May 16, Katherine and Joe Jackson brought their 9th child into this world and named her Janet Damita Joe Jackson.  Janet never understood that her father, Joe, predetermined her career after her brothers' success.  One day, she had a humble life in Gary, Indiana.  And the next day, Janet moved to Calabasas, California.  While she dreamed of becoming a lawyer, Joe put a microphone in Janet's hand and put her on a Las Vegas stage.  From that moment, Janet's life was no longer in her hands.  It will take several albums, marriages, and scandals for Janet Jackson to gain the control she championed.  As she takes you on a journey of her past, she learns things about herself too.<br/><br/>Watching this film, you learn two things about Janet Jackson.  First, she never plays the victim.  Second, she never speaks ill of anyone.  Janet has taken the time to seek some form of therapy. This self-care allowed her to gain insight and clarity, and her peace radiates across the screen.  Watch, learn, implement, and grow.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
