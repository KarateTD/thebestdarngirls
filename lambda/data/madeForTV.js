    "review":"Cassidy's boss, Detective Murphy, calls Cassidy into his office because she confronted and threatened a politician. Murphy's boss wants Cassidy fired, but Murphy tells her to take a vacation to St. Luke because she has a lot of time off.<br/><br/>Cassidy settles into her comfortable room and calls the concierge for advice on local restaurants. The concierge recommends Minerva's bar. Cassidy comes into the bar and catches Travis's eye. Travis defends Cassidy and asks her out on his boat to see the coral reefs.<br/><br/>After an uncomfortable encounter, Travis and Cassidy enjoy each other's company and leave after midnight. Cassidy and Travis plan to spend the day together until they see cops outside Minerva's bar. Inspector Dexter pulls out an evidence bag containing a knife and Minerva's blood. Travis thinks the weapon looks a lot like his. Dexter puts Travis in handcuffs and plans to question Travis at the station. Cassidy tells Dexter that Travis was with her that night but can't cover the murder's timeline. Cassidy doesn't believe Travis is capable of murder, and she will prove it.<br/><br/>This movie has a deserted island, explosions, and passionate love-making, but they couldn't save this film. This slow burn of moronic actions makes viewers yell at Cassidy, 'Just mind your business.' Winston is the saving grace of this plot with his on-the-mark comic relief. Be assured that you can skip this film in the Love, Lies, and Seduction series.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Eve urges her friend, Monica, to come home after a hard night of partying. Monica takes pictures of them at the club, and Eve tells Monica to stop. They are underage drinking and out past curfew. Monica says her account is private and to have fun. Monica leaves and apologizes to Eve while explaining that Eve has no idea what's happening.

After their meeting, Eve pulls Isabella aside to get a letter for the bursar's office. Eve explains her situation, and Isabella says they can't give Eve a letter because Eve is a contractor.

Unlike Bryce and Tamsen, Eve doesn't know she is now a high-end escort. If she goes against Carla, it will have deadly consequences.<br/><br/>Eve is naive to the 10th degree.

Ryan becomes upset and tells Tara that he hacked into the community college near hers and enrolled himself. Tara thinks Ryan went too far and breaks up with Ryan. Tara made plans with Tom. But cancels them and attends the party. Tara tries to have fun but gets a text message about her location.

    "review":"Liz, an economics teacher, beams with pride as two of her students, Dylan and Ariella, turn their class project into a real business. They created an extensive dating app but put all their money into research and development. So, they are asking teachers to sign up to spread the word and test the app. Liz tells them probably and leaves. Liz gets hit by a tennis ball on her way to an appointment. Ted, a coach, comes over, apologizes, and helps her cover the stain. Liz goes home and signs up for the site.<br/><br/>The teachers get together to assign events for the year. When the carnival comes up, everyone in the room is silent. So Liz volunteers. But when the principal asks Ted, he says he is too busy. Liz breathes an audible sigh of relief to her friend, Tammy, and Ted hears it. He changes his mind and joins the carnival committee. Then, Dylan convinces Ted to join the app too. With a string of bad first dates, a thirsty rival, and consolation prizes, will Ted and Liz find love?<br/><br/>This easy-going film makes you fall in love with Ted's parents and the '66 Mustang more than with the lead couple. However, it's hilarious watching Liz go through her bad dates. This movie also sparks an ongoing debate between those who believe winners should get trophies or if everyone should get a prize. But which side are you taking?<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
