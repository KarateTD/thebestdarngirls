    "mtitle": "Kidnapped By a Killer: The Heather Robinson Story",
    "review": "Heather Robinson returns home with her angry mother, Jill. Teenager Heather pierced a classmate without their parents' permission. Heather's father, Mike, laughs about and intensifies Jill's rage. Heather thinks Jill never wanted to adopt her and purposefully calls her mother by her name.<br/><br/>Jill, Mike, and Heather attend a family wedding. Her paternal uncle, John, asks Heather for a dance. Heather remembers that John set up her adoption. She asks John for her actual mother's name. John states that Jill is her actual mother. Later, John tells Heather her mother's name was Lisa. Heather confronts Jill with the information and demands to know the truth about Lisa. After some harsh words from Heather, Jill tells Heather that Lisa ended her life. Heather believes Jill is cruel and lying.<br/><br/>Two federal agents walk into Detective Coy's office. They were looking into a woman's disappearance. After she went missing, her mother got typed letters with her signature. Her mother confirmed the signature but said her daughter could hardly spell. She assumes the man, John, who was helping her, knows something. They started digging into John's background, and Coy's name appeared in several files. She believes John is responsible for killing several women, including an infant. Their investigation will turn Heather's life upside down.<br/><br/>This script offers viewers an unfiltered glimpse of Heather. She is spoiled, mouthy, and rude to Jill. This approach doesn't ingratiate her to desensitize Lifetimers. The movie then focuses its remaining time on John and his evil crimes. He manipulated, scammed, and murdered. And in brief second cuts, you see the actual victims' faces. It will break your heart while connecting you to the story. You should pay attention to the actors' clothing, hairstyle, and accessories; the movie isn't in chronological order. This film is gut-wrenching and magnificently done if you can handle Heather's attitude and John's creepiness.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Secret Life of My Other Wife",
    "review": "Waitress Bliss walks to her car after a grueling shift. Then, a rude customer accosts her in the parking lot. Nathan shouts in the distance. He notices the man has a limp and kicks the man in the knee. Nathan checks on Bliss and asks her to dinner. Bliss accepts.<br/><br/>Dinner is going great until Nathan drops two bombs. He has a teenage son, Matt, and two wives. Lauren was his first wife. Later, he met Jenna and added her to his family. Bliss is unsure about the lifestyle, so Nathan invites Bliss to visit his family.<br/><br/>Bliss arrives at the family farmhouse. Jenna is warm and friendly, but Lauren calmly threatens Bliss. Bliss has dreams of going to school and becoming a nurse. She doesn't think she can accomplish those goals with Nathan. He assures her that he will support her dreams. Bliss wants more time to think about it.<br/><br/>Carl sits at a table and requests Bliss. He tells Bliss that he's been following her. His sister, Anna, was married to Nathan, but he hadn't heard from Anna in years. Since Bliss is close to Nathan, Carl asks Bliss to investigate the matter. She says no. Carl whispers that he knows about Bliss's past and will tell everyone if she doesn't help.<br/><br/>Bliss returns to Nathan's home, and Lauren is unusually kind. She shows Bliss around the house and talks about Anna. She says Anna wanted more and left to find herself. Days later, Bliss gets a call from her landlord. He's doubling her rent. Then, her boss fires her. She calls Nathan. He invites Bliss to move in and join his family. She relaxes into the family dynamics until she finds Anna's heirloom locket. Bliss doesn't know who to trust. Will she uncover the truth?<br/><br/>This film is a giant red flag for any Lifetime viewer. Nathan uses cult tactics to lure Bliss into his trap. Your skin will crawl as Bliss falls for it. While this movie has a believable setup, the script doesn't deliver. The actors do their best to pull off a mystery with zero intrigue. You can guess what happened to Anna and why. The conclusion is sweet, but everything else will keep you scrolling on your phone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Thirteenth Wife: Escaping Polygamy (Part 2)",
    "review": "Rena vigorously wrings her hands as she recounts the day she pointed a gun at Dr. Rulon Allred. Reporter Josie asks if Rena pulled the trigger. Rena admits yes for the first time. She did it under the direction of her husband, cult leader Ervil. The jury's acquittal solidified Rena's faith while strengthening Ervil's paranoia. As Rena second-guesses Ervil's decisions, she considers leaving. But he won't let her go quietly, even from behind bars.<br/><br/>The second part of this movie will anger viewers more than the first. This film, like its predecessor, follows the interview process. So, Josie asks the questions that are in the audience's mind. Rena discusses her questioning beliefs, the change in leadership, and life after the cult. This story is worth the 4-hour running time and captivates with period costumes and technology. The script allows you to understand Rena's fear and confusion, then and now. Viewers should watch part two if they can handle the triggers in part one.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mr. Pawsitively Perfect",
    "review": "Julia moves another dog's photo from foster to adoption while encouraging her friend, Daisy, to adopt. Daisy wants to create a business but can't find the right idea. Julia mentions that her favorite TV couple, Jace and Anastasia, are breaking up. Daisy rolls her eyes because she and Jace went to high school together, but he was a few grades ahead. She remembers he was into sustainable designs. But as he gained fame, Jace became a corporate puppet. Daisy notices that Julia's face changes because Jace is behind her.<br/><br/>Jace returns home and talks to his friend, Matt. Surprisingly, Jace agrees with Daisy. Jace returns to Julia's adoption center to adopt a puppy. However, Daisy grabs the paperwork. Julia believes Daisy is overstepping but wants to help ease Daisy's fears. So, Julia tells Daisy to shadow Jace and the dog at the park. The deal turns sour when Jace mentions posting the dog's photos online. Daisy yells that Jace's rebrand will happen without the dog. She takes the dog and exits the park.<br/><br/>Daisy makes drinks at Julia's adoption center when Daisy's mother, Martha, enters. Martha announces that she's going to Paris. Daisy stammers because Martha always said they would go on the trip together. Daisy must find a way to make money for the trip. Then, she remembers that the Design and Inspiration Expo has a prize worth $50,000. If she wins, she can use the money for the trip while creating a new business. She recalls that Jace wants to rebrand. She will make an app to help people rebrand. Jace agrees to help if she eases him into dog ownership. Daisy agrees to his terms, but will she get more?<br/><br/>This movie follows the plot of an uptight woman and a relaxed man. Daisy is an off-putting character who's controlling and demanding. Writers should be careful not to alienate the audience from their lead protagonist. Jace is a man trying to find himself after a breakup. It's these character dynamics that make this film a shoo-in for the 2025 June Groom season. Otherwise, everything about this film is typical and doesn't garner too much of your attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Love on the Danube: Kissing Stars",
    "review": "Instead of getting a promotion, Savannah's boss, Betty, fires her. Savannah calls her friend, concierge Teddy. Teddy has a great idea to boost Savannah's resum√© and give her a free trip. The Emerald Cruise is hosting the first Kiss-Con. It's a convention for fans of romantic comedy. The coordinator, Liam, needs a publicist for one of his guests, actor Tripp.<br/><br/>Savannah arrives at the ship and greets Teddy. Savannah and Teddy meet with Liam. Liam explains that Tripp is struggling with his fame. He must connect with the fans because Tripp is up for a trilogy. Savannah promises to keep Tripp on time, engaged, and connected. Liam introduces Tripp to Savannah. He vehemently rejects having a handler.<br/><br/>Tripp misses the first introductions, and Liam blames Savannah. She looks around and sees Tripp at a food cart. She urges him to return when fans take photos of him. Tripp runs away. Savannah catches up to him and explains that she had the fans delete the images. Tripp and Savannah will collaborate to advance each other's careers. During their partnership, Teddy, Betty, and Captain Magnusson can see the attraction between them. But can Savannah and Tripp find the passion when the business comes between them?<br/><br/>This installment is the final film in the Love on the Danube trilogy. It expands the lives of Teddy, Captain Magnusson, and Betty while introducing the audience to a new couple. This film is funnier than the others but follows the same plot. It's the subplot between Betty and a former lover that will make your heart beat faster. Viewers will wonder if Betty will choose passion or wanderlust. If Hallmark keeps this series, Betty must remain a regular. Let's state this: the Kiss-Con cruise is a magical idea for Hallmarkies. The trilogy will make you watch, but Betty will keep you tuned in.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
