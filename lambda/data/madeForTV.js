    "mtitle": "I Was Honey Boo Boo",
    "review": "Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson was the youngest child of Mama June and Sugar Bear. She lived with her two sisters, Jessica and Pumpkin, but Alana was the apple in Mama June's eye. Alana was a proud pageant girl. She wanted to do Glitz Pageants, but Mama June couldn't afford them. Alana won her first pageant and, along with Mama June, garnered the attention of a TV scout.<br/><br/>At their second pageant, a scout pulled them aside and asked if they wanted to be on a show called Toddlers and Tiaras. She signs Alana up for the TV show and the Glitz Pageants. Alana has one-on-one sessions with producers while Mama June watches. Alana says her catchphrase, and it takes the nation by storm. Soon, the producers call Mama June to give Alana a reality show called Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Alana feels her mother's acceptance and pride for the first time. She believes everything will be better. However, her family will fall prey to transactional love, emotional abuse, neglect, and addiction with the world watching.<br/><br/>This movie is the first time Alana recounts her life for herself. It's for fans and non-fans of the family and their shows. The producers found actors who could mimic their well-documented accents and mannerisms. Also, Alana's narrations give the film much-needed authenticity. The plot digs into the darkest moments in Alana's life and captures how she felt then and now. It's easy for viewers to see this picture as a takedown of Mama June. However, it's a love letter for Pumpkin. While this film focuses on Alana's life, it's a searing indictment of children in reality. They need more protection and counseling because their parents sign them up for long-term judgment and ridicule that they will never understand. This movie deserves your undivided attention because you will never view reality TV the same.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Nanny Sees All",
    "review": "Grace converses with her husband, James, before meeting her friend, Andrea, at Andrea's diner. Andrea helped Grace get a nanny job with Mayor Alex. Grace will care for Alex and Emily's son, Andy. Andrea sees Alex outside and alerts Grace to growing tension in Rivertown. Someone shot and killed a young woman, Yasmine, and the police haven't caught the culprit. Alex mentions juggling fatherly and mayoral duties, and Grace offers to help by picking up Andy from school. Alex breathes a sigh of relief and gives Grace his keys.<br/><br/>Grace picks up Andy and drives to the mayor's estate. She brings Andy home and meets Alex's family and staff members. Mayor Alex and his wife, Emily, live with Alex's mother, Vivian. She is cold and distant with everyone but Alex and Andy. Alex's housekeeper, Louise, and the house chef, Colin, care for the family and love working for Alex. Vivian reminds Andy about his class project. Andy speaks proudly about his Italian heritage. Grace decides to use DNA testing as part of his project.<br/><br/>Grace meets with Andrea for lunch while Andy's at school. During their conversation, a woman, Victoria, walks to their table with choice words and a warning about Mayor Andy. Andrea informs Grace that Victoria was Andy's nanny until Yasmine died. Victoria and Yasmine were best friends, and Yasmine was Andy's nanny before Victoria.<br/><br/>Grace prepares Andy for a fun day at the park but notices he looks distressed. She assures Andy he will be okay. Then, Andy runs to Grace in a panic. She looks at the lake and sees Andy's ball floating next to a dead body. Detective Crossman arrives on the scene and identifies the body as Victoria. Grace thinks something's wrong. The family had two women connected to them die within months of each other. She keeps her job to care for Andy but falls into the culprit's crosshairs. Can Grace survive?<br/><br/>This movie offers Lifetime's usual suspects. The audience's mind races as they cycle through the clues. The test results will bring everything to a screaming halt. However, the results bring another twist to the film. Grace must solve a moral dilemma and a crime. The mystery gives the viewers a well-constructed recap to review clues they missed. This story is well crafted, but the audience will beg Grace to leave. No part-time job is worth this much stress. The picture is enjoyable, but the twists and turns can cause whiplash.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Love Club Moms: Harper",
    "review": "Harper and Lance arrive with their children, Tyler and Phoebe, to attend Phoebe's play. After the children walk to the stage, Lance tells Harper they shouldn't sit together because it will give the kids the wrong impression. Harper runs to the bathroom to scream. She exits and greets Tory and Nila. She alerts them that Lance asked for a separation. Then, they run into Jo and form the Love Club.<br/><br/>After seven months of separation, Lance stops by Harper's house to pick up the kids. Then, Lance asks Harper for a divorce. Harper jumps on the phone and texts the Love Club for lunch. She meets them and gives a sunny outlook on her future. However, her joyful disposition doesn't fool them.<br/><br/>Harper has a barbecue, but few people attend. Her friends believe that people are at Councilman Colin's party. Harper barges into Colin's event with the Love Club and demands to know why he threw his event on her day. He informs her that he didn't know about her barbecue before. He likes her tenacity and wants Harper to join his campaign. Harper refuses. The Love Club advises Harper to work with him because she can complete her city initiatives faster. Harper reconsiders working with Colin but doesn't know the Love Club has an ulterior motive. They see the love in Colin's eyes and hope Harper feels the connection too.<br/><br/>Harper and Colin work well together until his campaign manager convinces Colin to take credit for Harper's idea. Instead of joining Colin, she decides to beat him by running for councilwoman of their town. Will Harper and Colin's battle hinder the Love Club's plan?<br/><br/>The third installment of the Love Club Moms is the best of the series thus far. It's funny, thought-provoking, and lovable. Harper and Colin are two sides of the same coin. This dynamic makes them great teammates, opponents, and entertainment. While Harper does get petty, it only attracts Colin more and makes him want to change. Fortunately, they have the Love Club playing puppet master, and they will make you laugh out loud. This script is funnier, more relatable, and more mature than the others.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Love in the Clouds",
    "review": "Business reporter Brooklyn works for a local news station. She inserts fun into her segments, but the producer, Mary, doesn't like it. Brooklyn shares her frustrations with her videographer, Elise. Elise tells Brooklyn about a lifestyle job in New Mexico. Later, Mary calls Brooklyn into her office. The reporter Mary selected to cover the International Balloon Fiesta can't go. She asks Brooklyn to go instead and report back. Mary knows that attendees booked the hotels months in advance. So, she will work on finding a place for them to stay.<br/><br/>Jared runs a Romantic Hot Air Balloon ride business with his cousin Carlos. The bookings are slow, but Jared is confident they will pick up after the Fiesta. Then, Jared gets a call from Mary. He will allow Elise and Brooklyn to stay at his home, but he doesn't want his personal life to be a part of the story. Mary updates Brooklyn but tells Brooklyn to find the story that Jared is hiding.<br/><br/>Brooklyn and Elise arrive in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and travel to Jared's home. Elise can see the attraction. Brooklyn learns Jared is jaded about love and leaks the information to Mary. Mary wants him to be the focal point, or she will fire Brooklyn. However, Brooklyn doesn't believe she can do it because she's falling in love with him. Can Brooklyn report the story without losing Jared's trust, or will she give up her job?<br/><br/>This movie informs the audience about the Fiesta, the box, the International Balloon Museum, Paws and Stripes, and Green Chili while having two subplots. However, the information is better than most of the movie. Nevertheless, the process of Jane and Brad figuring out their next phase in life makes you fall in love with the script. Jane works her magic on Brad and the two couples around her. You will cheer for her. Also, there is a cute love story involving Elise and Carlos that doesn't overshadow Jared and Brooklyn. This film is what Hallmarkies expect and nothing more.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Baby My Husband Lied About",
    "review": "Spencer and Jennifer arrive at the home of Spencer's parents, Annabel and William, for their 40th wedding anniversary party. Then, Spencer asks if today is the best day to announce their first pregnancy. Jennifer says no because it's too soon. She wants to keep it between them for a little longer.<br/><br/>Jennifer greets Annabel and William before making an uncomfortable excuse to walk away. Then she sees Spencer's cousin, Marcus, and Marcus's wife, Carrie, across the room. Jennifer doesn't understand the growing tension between Marcus and Spencer but won't let that dismantle her friendship with Carrie.<br/><br/>Marcus slinks to Jennifer's side and hands her an envelope. He demands to talk privately to her afterward, and she agrees. Jennifer waves to her fertility specialist, Dr. Clark, but he doesn't return the gesture. Then, Spencer tells everyone that they will have a baby soon. Annabel jumps for joy and gushes over a cringing Jennifer. She can't believe he revealed their secret.<br/><br/>Later, Jennifer leaves to meet Marcus on the steps. She screams when she finds his body at the landing. The family calls the police, and they start the investigation. Jennifer overhears Spencer lying to the police and demands to know why. He didn't want to air his dirty laundry.<br/><br/>A day later, she tells Carrie about the letter Marcus gave her. She drums up the courage to open it, and it states that Spencer is sterile. She blames the fertility clinic. Until they have answers, she won't tell Spencer. Jennifer deduces that this could be the reason someone murdered Marcus. Can Jennifer and Carrie uncover the truth?<br/><br/>This family is messy, and every commercial break brings more drama. The writer depends on shock value to drive the story. The family scenes are dark and dreary, but moments with Carrie are full of light. This lighting choice gives the viewer a window into Jennifer's emotional state. This film is an entertaining time killer with one unforeseen twist during the killer's monologue. This picture is for you if you love drama. Otherwise, leave it for a rainy day.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
