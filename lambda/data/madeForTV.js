    "review":"Olivia puts on a fake belly and prepares the staff for the changes to the household. She informs them that she is pregnant, her step-mother-in-law, Alicia, is leaving for Philidelphia, and Alicia's son, Christopher, will stay. Olivia puts Alicia in the chamber maids' quarters with access to the attic. After childbirth, Olivia will pretend the baby is hers, and Alicia will quietly retreat with Christopher. Olivia falsely believes this will give her control over Malcolm and the household. Unfortunately, it will take 15 years for Olivia to see she never had power in Foxworth Hall. She is a victim and perpetrator of Malcolm's crimes and sinful nature.<br/><br/>Based on Garden of Shadows by V.C. Andrews, this segment continues where part one left off but jumps 15 years within the movie. All the children grow up and suffer at Malcolm's feet while they try to assert control over their money, love, and body. However, Olivia does the most in-depth soul searching and self-realization of any character. Unlike the first, this film ends on a predictable cliffhanger.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Keeping Up With the Joneses: The Wrong Murder",
    "review":"The Jones women work on building around their water wealth while starting a charity, but Webb's death looms over them. Robin handles business dealings while answering questions about her involvement. Pam entices Stephen to look into the sabotage. Also, Pam asks Sheldon to look into Eve's story. Eve says she is Pam's long-lost child, but Pam desires proof. Kayla takes a bold leap into the dating world but can't shake off her ex-fianc√©, William. Carrie works hard to get her family to accept and trust Lance. However, one person wants to take advantage of Lance's nefarious nature. Leo did some digging and discovered Lance's clever insider trading deal. Tara doesn't believe Eve, so Tara asks Rich to seduce Eve for information. Until then, Tara works overtime to make the family see her as an adult. The Jones women maintain appearances while gaining control of their professional endeavors. How can they do it with the wrong murder hanging over their head and enemies encroaching from every side?<br/><br/>Each installment widens Jones's world and enriches the main characters' storylines. Of course, new characters get a brief introduction, but established characters receive a more bountiful backstory. Don't be fooled by the title. This movie won't satisfy your morbid needs until the last 30 minutes. However, there is plenty of drama, fashion, and backstabbing to keep your interest. Have your wine ready for the next episode.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rochelle moved in with her father, Ernest, after losing her job, health, and husband, Michael. She worked on a sting operation and uncovered Michael, a cop, received dirty money. Then, someone shot her while speaking to her informant, Tyler. Now, Rochelle awaits to testify against Michael for the FBI and works in financial forensics. Rochelle calls for her father but can't find him in the house. Her neighbor, Keele, tells Rochelle to call the police, but they offer little to no help because they hold a grudge. Ernest resurfaces and doesn't understand the fuss. He was with her new neighbor, Jesse.<br/><br/>Ernest admits that he worries about Rochelle. Later, Jesse comes to the house with a misdelivered package and invites Rochelle to come out sometime. Keele coyly meets Jesse at the bar with Rochelle. Jesse starts a conversation with Rochelle, and she brings him home for a one-night stand. Rochelle discovers calm in the handsome stranger, but she doesn't know about the evil within.<br/><br/>First of all, Keele is on another level. Second of all, Rochelle is too trusting. Like Wayward, this movie gets gory. But it satisfies a bloodlust without alienating its audience. This movie follows the Lifetime format, but it's a fun watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gail and her husband, Rick, moved to a new town with their daughter, Chloe, for Rick's new job. When she drops Chloe off at school, Gail doesn't notice Vanessa spying on her from the bookshelf. Vanessa comes out and introduces herself as the president of the PTA. Vanessa encourages Gail to join for Chloe's education, the school, and fun.<br/><br/>At the meeting, Gail gets to know the other parents but asks about Lexie's memorial in the front office.

Afterward, everyone loves Gail's cookies, but no one touches Vanessa's treats. Vanessa's envy and jealousy boil over, and she wants Gail gone now.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that this is over a Rice Krispy Treat. If Vanessa focused on her daughter, Serena, instead of being the queen bee, Gail would be just another PTA member. But Vanessa's meddling and insults raise Gail's interests. Also, Serena is a fruit from the poisonous tree. This film will feed your guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love on Fire",
    "review":"Gia drives to her new home and spots a grill for free outside the firehouse. She stops to inquire about the grill, and firefighter Jim comes out to greet her. Jim tells Gia that they are replacing the old and malfunctioning grill, but it could work with some TLC.<br/><br/>Gia unpacks and hears Karen knocking on her back door. Karen is married to Jim's best friend, Mo. Gia says she moved to town for a fresh start and to build a playground.

The firefighters want a gym, but Mayor Don won't allow it because he cares about money. Gia works with Don and offers to help the firefighters. As Gia and Jim work together, a romance develops, but they deny it because both suffer from deep-seated loss. Can they work through the pain and love each other?<br/><br/>Yes, this movie follows the format, but it sparks immense feelings while opening your eyes. This film doesn't shy or laugh away the pain, but it leans into it and expresses each person's emotions in believable detail. You will get misty-eyed as Karen talks about Julia wanting to play with her friends. This movie will tug on your heartstrings and won't let go.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
