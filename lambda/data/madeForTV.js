    "review":"Mari washes dishes when her daughter, Shannan, comes down the steps.  Mari knows her daughter is a prostitute and offers alternative jobs.  Shannan laughs and tells Mari she will be back on Mother's Day.  After two days, Mari gets a call from a blocked number.  The voice on the other end says that he runs a home for wayward girls, and he tried to help Shannan. Mari goes to the police to report Shannan missing, but when they hear she is a prostitute, they stop caring and tell her to tell it to the county police where Shannan dwells.  Frustrated, Mari leaves, but she stops when she gets another phone call from a blocked number.  The caller said he tried to help Shannan, but Shannan left.  Mari runs into the police station.  And seeing she is frantic, Chief Detective Dominick Varrone steps in to help Mari. She begs Dominick to find Shannan, but when she feels he isn't doing enough, she calls a private investigator, Herc Zinneman.  He doesn't offer much hope, but he promises to use his connections to get Mari more information.  With Mari's motherly determination, she set the wheels in motion and uncovers corruption, several killers, and dozens of victims.<br/><br/>Inspired by real events, the sad fact is that plenty of these murders didn't have to happen if police investigated the initial disappearances.  Instead, they stopped caring the moment they heard the women's profession.  This ignorance allowed several serial killers to operate in or around Suffolk County. By the end of the movie, you will learn Mari's horrifying conclusion.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"At her father's wake, Kaylee has a hard time composing herself and looks to her friend, Ariana, to comfort her.  However, Ariana is more concerned with her performance at the funeral than Kaylee's feelings.  Ariana explains that she entered a contest to sing next to her idol and crush, Josh Halliday. A few days later, Ariana got great news: she won the contest, and she invites Kaylee to go with her. At the concert, Ariana does well, but she notices that Josh focuses more on Kaylee in the crowd than her on stage.  When the two women go backstage, Josh continues his aloof behavior towards Ariana to talk to Kaylee.  Ariana cuts off their conversation to invite Josh to her performance at a local bar.  He accepts and goes the next night.  While Ariana is singing, she can see Josh and Kaylee getting close, so she invites Josh on stage.  Josh starts the song by dedicating it to Kaylee. The next morning, Ariana gets an alert on her phone that the paparazzi took photos of Kaylee and Josh together.  They are calling Kaylee Josh's newest 'it' girl.  Ariana decides she will do anything to get her man back.<br/><br/>IMDB describes this movie as Swimfan meets A Star is Born.  However, this film should be called Swimfan with music. As Ariana slowly devolves into madness, it's unsettling to see Kaylee ignore the warning signs.  But when Kaylee describes their relationship, you will understand that loyalty blocks her ability to see Ariana's true nature.  Ariana is possessive, obsessive, and a self-mutilator.  This movie could be a trigger for anyone dealing with that coping mechanism. With a psychological final fight scene and one unanswered question, this movie is a fun watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Christie runs into the police station, ready to confess the information she has about her mother, Ella.  Then, she hears a familiar voice screaming.  It's Ella.  She is screaming that the police made a mistake and she didn't kill him. Hours ago, Ella found the body of Malik Thompson in her pool.  Then, the police came to her door for a disturbance call. They enter the home and find the body.  She is immediately their number one suspect.  At the police station, Ella is furious. When she finally gets a visitor, it's her mother, Leona.  Leona offers to help, but only if Ella signs over her power of attorney to Leona.  Under duress, Ella signs.  Leona goes to councilwoman Kimberly's office and demands Kimberly make her acting mayor of Cypress. Ella watches TV and sees Kimberly swearing-in the new acting-mayor, Leona.  Ella knows this is Leona's first step to controlling her, the New Hope Church, and Cypress.<br/><br/>Like Hallmark, Bounce TV created a movie to kick off the new season of Saints and Sinners.  New viewers will not understand some comments, so it's vital to watch previous seasons. Now this movie does answer two burning questions.  First is who killed Malik Thompson.  The second is why does Leona commit such deceitful acts.  Both answers will leave you stunned, but both centers on betrayal.  This movie will be a favorite like the show.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
