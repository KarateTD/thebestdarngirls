    "review":"Simon drags his girlfriend, Detective Max, to Jen's grand opening because Jen is Max's best friend.  Jen started the store with the help of her husband, Greg.  Jen states she became bored of being a kept woman, so she decided to start a business.  During the opening, a masked person sends a message and warns Max that he will bring deception to the light.  Max forgets about it until she and her partner, Nick, get called on a new case.  Tom was found dead by strangulation with a charm around his neck.  During Max and Nick's interview with Tom's wife, Sarah, they learn he was a gambling addict.  But when they interview the house manager, Francis, they learn Tom wasn't addicted to gambling.  He was addicted to sex.  As they continue the investigation, Max and the precinct get more video messages warning them about more killings.  Soon, a pastor is found dead with slashes all over his body.  A killer whipped the pastor to death and put a charm around his neck.  His wife said her husband loved BDSM and hired women to hit him frequently.  The Charm Killer directs his next message for Max.  She tries to brush it off until her ex-husband, Ryan, is found dead. With the personal message and killing, Max's boss believes the Charm Killer is someone she knows.<br/><br/>This movie is a different type of Lifetime movie because it is a full murder mystery with kinky sex, adultery, an intriguing killer, a distinctive signature, and a horrible friend.  Though Max is strong in her relationship, her friendship is toxic.  However, that toxic friendship is necessary for the plot.  So before you yell at Max, bite your tongue and watch.  It will be a good payoff.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Justine and Tom received bad news, their adoption agency hasn't found a match for them.  Justine is crushed but Tom thinks its a sign to take a break from the process.  Justine is dumbfounded by his change of heart.  She blames it on his promotion and new work schedule.  She feels off-balanced, belittled, and ignored.  Her friend, Ginnie, tells Justine to take a yoga class.  The handsome instructor, Dominic, will take her mind off Tom and her adoption problems. After a great class, Justine tries to convey to Tom what she learned but he blows her off.  She arrives at the next class early but Dominic allows her to set up.  He can see she is hurting and offers to give private instructions. As Justine and Dominic get closer, she pulls further away from Tom.  She doesn't know the danger lurking around the corner. Justine is just the next name on his list.<br/><br/>This movie, originally titled The Perfect Pose, should have not been renamed.  When Lifetime fans see Psycho in the title, their bloodlust rises to an exponential level. For this movie, the first death isn't mentioned until 1.5 hours into the movie.  This is why most fans are let down.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"D. A. Yasmine let her past get to her while she was questioning a witness.  The defendant, Timothy, is accused of killing his wife.  When Yasmine was younger, her abused mother and her drunken father got into an argument.  During the argument, her mother slipped and fell down the steps.  She died. When the case is dropped because of jury tampering, Yasmine has an outburst and faints.  Later, Yasmine's boss, Joan Winters, tells Yasmine to take a sabbatical while they prepare to try the case again. Yasmine packs up and heads to her sister's home with her daughter, Paige.  Her sister, Laura, remembers the abuse but has chosen to forgive their father.  While Yasmine is staying with her, Laura hopes she can convince Yasmine to reconcile with their father too. With so much going on at home, Yasmine doesn't see trouble lurking around the corner.  Timothy is out to get her and everyone she cares about.  He will do anything to get his kids back and stay out of jail.<br/><br/>This movie seems to lose direction.  At first, it feels like a piece about domestic violence.  Then, it jumps to forgiveness.  Next, PTSD.  Then, a mystery of who can Yasmine trust.  And back again.  It's hard to understand if you are watching a mystery, a thriller, or a statement. This movie tries to cover too much in two hours.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Karen is having vivid nightmares of killing a woman she has never met.  She tells her husband, Otto, that her dreams a scaring her.  Otto, a psychotherapist, tells her to relax. The next morning, Karen sees a missing flyer for a young woman named Gina.  Karen recognizes Gina as the girl in her dreams and starts to panic. Otto suggests Karen try hypnosis to unlock her memories of Gina.  She agrees.  When she opens her eyes, she is on top of the dam and can't move.  Dr. Hugh pulls over to talk her down from what he believes is a suicide attempt. She begs Hugh to take her home instead of the hospital for observation.  He complies.  Karen is shocked to come home and see police everywhere.  They found Gina dead in the pool shed and Otto recorded Karen's confession to the murder. She tries to maintain her composure until police find her fingerprints on the plastic tarp that contained Gina's remains.   With no one on her side, Karen will bleed, fight, and banter to find out what really happened to Gina.<br/><br/>This movie starts crazy, gets insanely funny, and gives you a nutsy good ending.  You will be engaged with the mystery of what happened to Gina.  The title does give something away but you have no idea how bad her husband is until he goes too far. In the midst of all these wild accusations, Karen finds Hugh.  They have the best on-the-run banter ever seen in a movie.  Get comfortable and hold on tight.  You are in for a great movie.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
