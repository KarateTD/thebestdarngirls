    "mtitle":"Robin Roberts Presents: Mahalia",
    "review":"In 1923, Aunt Duke shooed away onlookers as they listen to young Mahalia sing in her Louisiana home.  Aunt Duke walked into the house and made Mahalia stop.  She won't allow Mahalia to get baptized because she doesn't sing gospel music the proper way.  Years later, Mahalia is married and works as a maid.  She tried to make an album, but it flopped. Eight years later, Mahalia owes a beauty shop and its building, has three tenants paying rent, and got a divorce.  But she still dreams of singing and saves money to build a temple. As Mahalia sings in the gospel circuit, she garners the attention of Mrs. Berman at Apollo Records.  Mrs. Berman wants Mahalia to sing the blues, but Mahalia refuses. Mahalia believes that gospel music is the cure for the blues.  Mrs. Berman allows Mahalia to sing her songs her way, but she has two hours to record.  After an all-night recording session, Mahalia creates Move On Up A Little Higher.  It shatters records with two million album sales.  As she sings worldwide, Mahalia battles the secular struggles of racism, love, greed, and self-acceptance.<br/><br/>Danielle Brooks' performance gives Mahalia Jackson the flowers she knowingly deserves.  This movie doesn't gloss over Mahalia's struggles in the gospel industry, but it faces them head-on. She helped usher the Civil Rights Movement with fundraisers, sermons, and songs.  Through several marriages, illnesses, and disappointments, Mahalia continues to mother all those in need. This need for consistent growth helped drive her career to become the Queen of Gospel.  Allow her story to inspire you, and in turn, build her temple.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After someone murders Brianna's mother, Mindy, Evelyn pleads with her mom, Lucy, to let Brianna move in with them.  Lucy conceded but only until they can get in touch with Mindy's cousin.  As Brianna and Evelyn get closer, Lucy feels that something's off about Brianna.  Lucy looks into Brianna's past and learns that Brianna's last school expelled her for breaking another student's nose.  Then Evelyn's English teacher, Ms. Walsh, accuses Brianna of plagiarizing Evelyn's English paper.  Lucy confronts Brianna, but Evelyn said she turned in the term paper without Brianna's knowledge.  Lucy accepts the excuse but worries that Brianna is manipulating her daughter. Lucy will come face to face with a painful reality and a lighter.<br/><br/>This suspense thriller gives Lifetimers plenty of mystery with lots of dubious characters. As the plot exposes whereabouts, you will cross unsubs off your list.  And you will go back and forth between the final 2.  Even though the police have one person in custody, a necklace will make you question who the real puppet master is.  This movie is prime for part 2, and you will want it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Psychologist Dr. Miranda runs the Breakup Bootcamp.  It helps people get over their failed relationships with six-themed weeks.  After an interview on 'Good Day Portland,' Miranda goes to dinner.  After her meal, she waits outside of the restaurant for her car and sees Ben standing there.  Ben tells Miranda that his girlfriend, Jen, broke up with him because he works too much.  Miranda comforts him, and he goes home.  The next day, Ben's sister, Kim, shows him a flyer for the Breakup Bootcamp. She heard great reviews about this one and wants to give it a try.  But she doesn't want to do it alone.  So, Kim asks Ben to go with her. Before he walks in on the first day, Ben sees Miranda outside the group therapy room.  He doesn't waste any time telling her his true feelings about the self-help group and others like it.  When Miranda walks into the room and reveals herself, Ben is stunned.  Ben decides not to take the class.  But his boss wants Ben to do an exposé on the boot camp for the magazine.  If he writes a compelling article, Ben will get a feature editor promotion. But with each week, he grows closer to Miranda.  Will the love end when she reads his article titled Fad or Phenomenon?<br/><br/>Don't Go Breaking My Heart is one of those few movies that unknowingly helps while it entertains. The movie takes the time to warn about rebound dating, warn about cyberstalking, and tell the viewer the steps are repeatable. The product placement was extremely obvious and, therefore, distracting, and there was a missed love connection.  But that can wait until part two.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Paul brings Ruby and her daughter, Pearl, to his sprawling estate called Cypress Woods.  Inside, Ruby sees a proposal written with rose petals.  She loves Paul but says no because they are half-siblings.  Paul doesn't care, and the town doesn't know their history. With sadness and regret, Ruby turns him down and heads back to her family home on the bayou.  She hopes to make a living like her grandmère, by selling goods, until Buster comes to collect what her grandpère promised.  Ruby attacks Buster, grabs Pearl, and elopes to marry Paul.  Now, Ruby and Paul reside together but in separate bedrooms. Everything goes well until Giselle blows into town with news. Beau broke off his engagement to his Parisian heiress, and Giselle wants to help him.  The information leaves Ruby in pure shock and confusion. Then she gets a letter from Giselle detailing how she and Beau are married. Ruby attempts to forget Giselle and Beau until she gets a call that her step-mother, Daphne, died.  Now Giselle and Ruby must work together to keep the money away from Daphne's late husband, Bruce.  After meeting, Beau invites Ruby to his private loft in the French Quarters for a romantic affair, and she can't say no.  Afterwards, Ruby comes home to a devastated Paul. Seeing Paul's suffering, Ruby agrees to stop seeing Beau. Days later, Ruby gets a call that Giselle fell ill after a mosquito bite, and she won't get better.  Beau says they have a second chance because no one knows Giselle is sick.  Ruby can switch places with her twin, and they can have a life together with Pearl as one big happy family. Paul agrees to the swap.  Ruby plays the part of the viper-tongued Giselle in public and Ruby in private.  After a suicide, Ruby's secrets come back to haunt her, and she could lose Pearl in a custody war.<br/><br/>Based on All that Glitters, this installment gives you V.C. Andrews' twists and turns with a wild twin swap.  Seeing Ruby slip into Giselle's vitriol comments like a glove is disturbing as it is entertaining. Playing Giselle, Ruby feels strong and in control. But with great power comes great responsibility and treachery.  Let's hope the fourth installment keeps the drama coming.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
