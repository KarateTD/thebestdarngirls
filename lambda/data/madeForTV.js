        "review":"Joanie is invited to a party by Annabelle and Sharane.  She meets Annabelle's boyfriend Danny.  Danny calibrates expensive camera lenses and Annabelle and Sharane hand delivers them because they are too fragile.  He offers to hire Joanie to make a delivery.  She is happy to make her first $1000 but her mother is pissed and starts asking questions.  However, the questions stop when she gives her mom the money.  During the next delivery, Joanie starts getting suspicious and looks into the lenses.  She finds several uncut diamonds.  Joanie wants out.  But when her brother needs surgery, she goes back.  Soon, the feds are at her doorstep.<br/><br/> Joanie's story is the typical naive girl led astray.  You feel some relief when her mother says everything you are thinking but when she caves, you want to scream.  This movie does successfully show the link between diamond smuggling to blood diamonds and the 9/11 attacks.  While the lead up to Joanie's arrest is not typical, the ending is 100% Lifetime.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

When her home and work life starts to fall apart, Kathy blames Hanna.  But no one believes her.  They think she is paranoid or is threaten because Hanna is so good.  Kathy will prove them wrong.<br/><br/>Based on a novel, this movie is a slow build to very little climax.  This movie follows all the Lifetime rules and becomes background noise.  You are better off reading the book.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
