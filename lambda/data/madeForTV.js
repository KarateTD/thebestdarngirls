    "review": "Tennis bad boy Luke retires from the game after winning his first championship. He returns home to capitalize on his newfound fame at his parents' racquet club. He wants to start the Luke Hollis Champion Center to train high-paying clientele. His family gives each other knowing glances, prompting Luke to demand an explanation. The club is drowning in debt, and a developer wants to buy the land for luxury condos. The club's saving grace is pickleball. Caroline, the trainer, has brought in new customers and an energetic spirit to the court. However, it's not bringing in enough income to save the club.<br/><br/>Luke arrives at the club and demands that Caroline move so he can teach tennis. She stands her ground and tells him to go to the tennis courts. Caroline finishes her session with her clients before confronting Luke for his behavior. She believes he should find a way to coexist with pickleball because it's the fastest-growing sport in the United States. They organize a tournament to raise donations. He's willing to host the event and contacts his old manager, Amy. Amy wants to help, but she says he must play to gain the response he needs. Caroline offers to train him, but only if he takes it seriously. He must slow down his game, play on a team, and release his aggression to succeed. What else will Caroline teach him?<br/><br/>This film follows the standard holiday romance format, while barely mentioning Christmas. Lifetime attempts to capitalize on a trendy sport, but doesn't draw new fans. The plot does get saucy because it has more liberty with this network. However, that's not enough to capture your attention. The dialogue between Luke and his sister, Jordan, is tender, but this film isn't a standout for the 2025 Lifetime Christmas season. Sadly, Lifetime didn't save the best for last.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Amanda owns a small bakery that's fallen on hard times. Entrepreneur Simon enters with a business proposition and convinces Amanda to give him five minutes of her time. Amanda listens, but she doesn't want to be an influencer to sheep, so she rejects his offer. She believes winning The Big Holiday Pastry Show again will help revive her business. Meanwhile, the show's producer, Marianna, calls Amanda—the call time has been moved up to now. Amanda rushes to the studio, meets her rival KT, and receives her first baking assignment: make a treat that embodies the holiday spirit. Amanda remembers a dessert created by her mentor, Jackie, called Joy To The World Fudge.<br/><br/>At the same time, Simon reviews his Aunt Jackie's books, hoping to help her business grow. Jackie expresses concern that Simon doesn't understand the bakery trade, but she's about to leave for a vacation in Finland with her new boyfriend. She agrees to let Simon run her shop while she's gone, promising she'll trust him to expand the business if he proves himself.<br/><br/>Days later, the slew of customers overwhelms Simon. Amanda enters the store and can't believe a suit is running her mentor's shop. She sees him fumble and takes over the register as Simon retreats to the back. When he returns, she asks about the fudge, and he gives her one box. She chuckles because its not enough. Amanda asks if Jackie left the recipe behind. Simon emphatically says no because that recipe is a highly guarded secret. The five secret ingredients are hidden in Jackie's love story. They will follow the story and unlock the clues. Will they reveal more?<br/><br/>This film's humor and mystery are entertaining. Amanda and Simon use tools, a spa, and pancakes to find the secret ingredients. Nothing will stop them from making Jackie's famous fudge. The moments in between with the rival love interest and the baking competitor slow down the plot. So viewers should watch if they need comfort TV to ease out of the holidays.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sienna and her sleuth group solved a cold case, and she became a cover girl for a magazine. Melissa saw it and wrote to Sienna and her group for help. Melissa's friend, Lexie, went missing 4 years ago. Melissa thinks Sienna and her group could help move the case forward. Sienna presents the case to her friend, Gregory, and the newcomer, Tyler. They agree to take the case and travel to Georgia to review the case files and question suspects.<br/><br/>Sienna calls Gregory before they leave for Georgia. However, Gregory can't make it because someone set a fire in his dorm. Sienna tells her boyfriend, Marcus, that she's going alone with Tyler. Marcus isn't happy about the change and asks Sienna to share her location with him. Sienna and Tyler go on the hunt to uncover what happened to Lexie. Will Sienna and Tyler survive the truth?<br/><br/>This film details how an intelligent person can make unwise decisions. Sienna falls for every trap possible and ends up in the hands of a killer. However, she isn't alone. The people who care for her drop everything to help when they discover that she's in trouble. The group effort is refreshing in an LMN film. This movie is the perfect break from the holiday season with great pacing, but it doesn't require your full attention.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nikki works as the choir director at her father's church. Everyone know she can sing, but she hasn't since she was a child. Nikki enforces strict rules on her children's choir to ensure a perfect performance. Soon, the church will have a Christmas Eve concert for the parishioners.<br/><br/>Jake receives a phone call from his mother. The pipe in their family synagogue burst during his father's sermon. Rabbi Levi doesn't know what he will do because Hanukkah is starting soon. Also, his grandmother, Mrs. Markel, hurt herself in the maylay. Jake rushes home to be by their side.<br/><br/>Jake arrives at the synagogue to visit his father and sees Nikki across the street struggling with a box. He runs over to help her. They try to catch up, but their meddling mothers constantly talk about the other. It doesn't take long for the pair to rekindle their old rivalry. They part ways in a huff.<br/><br/>As Pastor Roberts and Rabbi Levi talk, they come up with a great idea. The synagogue will have its services in the church, and they will raise funds to help fix the plumbing during the Christmas Eve concert. Then, they decide to join the children's choir for a song. Mrs. Markel puts Jake in charge of her choir. Now, bitter enemies must put their past aside to create a song for the Christmas Eve concert. Can they succeed without killing each other?<br/><br/>The families make this film. It is delightful with nagging moms and worried dads. And grandma plays everyone like puppets on a string. The writers did a stellar job with Jake instructing Nikki on how to navigate his family dinner. It's a scene you can watch repeatedly and hear a new joke. However, the rest of the film is Hallmark fluff. Hallmarkies need a movie that centers around the family and their antics.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Rose worries about her husband, Josh, on an Alaskan oil rig, White Aurora, after their call disconnects. Her sister, Becca, advises Rose to call the parent company, Leed Oil, for more information. She takes Becca's recommendation and gets forwarded to Logan in public relations. Logan explains the rig had a power glitch, and everything will be okay soon.<br/><br/>After the call, Logan speaks to his boss's boss, Martin. Logan connected with Rose's family and wishes he could be there to comfort them. This gives Martin a great idea for publicity. He wants Logan to fly to Montana and get photos with Josh's family. The only catch is Martin doesn't want Logan to tell anyone why he's there. Logan agrees, flies to Montana, and meets Becca. He's instantly smitten with her. He gets closer to her business, family, and farm. Will Martin's corporate greed affect their budding romance?<br/><br/>This film's captivating moments aren't the love story. It's Logan's inner turmoil and Josh's return home. The writers put so much detail into those storylines that the romance is a byproduct. And let's not forget the platinum dad jokes from Becca and Rose's dad, Anthony. This film is captivating, but not for the love; it's the compassion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
