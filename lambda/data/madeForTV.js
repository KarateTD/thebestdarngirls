    "review":"Erin returns home with exciting news for her husband, Jared. A gallery wants to feature her paintings in their upcoming show. Erin's friend, Suzanne, wishes that Jared would support Erin's career more. Erin says that Jared sees her paintings as a hobby because he is an estate attorney from a well-off family.<br/><br/>Jared sees a man's name on Erin's caller ID and questions her about Angel. Erin explains that Angel owns the gallery, and Jared accuses Erin of teasing Angel to get in the show. Later, Erin brings up his irrational behavior in the car, and Jared screams while punching the steering wheel.<br/><br/>Angel praises Erin's collection and gives her a peck on the cheek at the art show. Jared becomes jealous and pulls her away. He grabs Erin's arm, hurts Erin, and forces Erin to leave the art show early. When they get home, Jared tells Erin her art career is over. Erin calls Suzanne and packs a bag to leave. Erin looks for the car keys but can't find them. Jared stands behind her with them in his hands, taunting her. Before Jared can take Erin away, Suzanne arrives with her camera phone ready to record. They escape, and Erin spends the night with Suzanne.<br/><br/>Their days together are short-lived because Erin knows Jared is following her. So, Erin sneaks out of Suzanne's home, gets on a bus, and travels to the home of her friend, Katie. Nevertheless, Jared isn't far behind. His father told Jared to get control of his house and wife because their family has a name to uphold in the community. Erin has no idea who she can trust.<br/><br/>Welcome to old-school Lifetime movies. Erin does what society tells victims of abuse to do; leave the first time the abuser strikes. However, this movie points out how Erin's mental abuse happened during the entire relationship. Jared belittled her career, controlled her communications, and alienated her from friends. And Jared's parents are not a prize for any child. This Enough-like movie gives self-defense techniques and a realistic look of an abused woman on the run. Be prepared to watch, scream, and cheer.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Who Killed Our Father",
    "review":"Leila comes home to find her friend, Iris, dead and Iris's boyfriend, Tyler, standing over Iris with a knife. They fight, and Leila stabs and kills Tyler. Leila wants to call the police, but her boyfriend, Brad, convinces Leila not to do it. Three months later, Leila secretly takes a DNA test to find her family but notices Brad acting strange. He confesses that he owes his bookie $50,000. Later, Brad finds Leila's results under the door, and Leila reads them. She discovers she has a sister, Violet, and a dad, Scott. She looks them up on the internet and uncovers that Scott is a millionaire. She leaves Brad and his debts behind and treks from Atlanta to Philadelphia to find her family.<br/><br/>Violet dislikes her stepmother, Nora, but dotes on their housekeeper, Hazel.

After Hazel leaves, Nora invites Violet to get a day of pampering with Nora's sister, Faith. Violet rolls her eyes and goes to her room. Later, Detective Howard knocks on the door looking for Nora. Someone killed Scott during his run using blunt force trauma to the head.<br/><br/>Leila appears on Nora's doorstep a few days later with her condolences.

Violet thinks Leila could be the murderer. Leila has troubles too. Brad followed her. He wants Leila to get the money he owes from her newfound family. However, Leila and Violet get to know and slowly put their trust in each other. They decide to work together and discover who killed their father.<br/><br/>This movie provides enough mystery to keep you watching while providing traps for experienced Lifetimers. Leila gets the DNA test but doesn't hesitate to show Nora and Violet. Leila never hides who she is but keeps them in the dark about Brad. The final variable in the formula is the housekeeper with a secret. The writers use your knowledge of the predictable plot to point you in all the wrong directions, but the ending is classic. One watch is enough, but it's worth it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Luckless in Love",
    "review":"Winnie is a staff writer for Mush, an online lifestyle brand for women. Winnie writes a dating blog under the pseudonym Luckless in her spare time. Before going to work, Winnie and Kyra stop at a coffee shop. Kyra spots a cute guy leaving and can't take her eyes off him. Winnie and Kyra go to work and sit for a staff meeting. Their boss, Inga, wants to pull Winnie from the single-women advice column and put her on facial oils. Winnie leaves and airs her frustrations to Kyra. Kyra tells Winnie to go on a date with a commitment-phobic man-child and write a Luckless blog for Mush. They go through an app and see the coffee shop guy, Holden, and set up a date.<br/><br/>Holden struck out again after his date, Brittany, discovered Holden's teenage son, Ty. Holden is a sports agent and meets with his boss, Ret . Ret wants Holden to take over the company, but Holden hasn't proven himself worthy. Holden sees the Insider's Gala invitation on Ret's desk. However, Ret tells Holden not to come because Holden only brings drama and embarrassment to the company's brand. Nevertheless, Ret is willing to make a deal. If Holden can put his playboy ways behind him by finding a serious woman to date and make a commitment, Ret will let Holden and his date come. At first, Holden says no, but Ty convinces him otherwise. Holden goes on the app and finds Winnie.<br/><br/>Holden and Winnie meet at a bar, and things start well until Brittany walks up to Holden and questions him. Brittany throws a drink in Holden's face and walks away. Winnie wants to know why Brittany is so angry, but Holden refuses to talk about it. After an argument on the street, Winnie goes home and writes about the date on her blog.<br/><br/>Inga calls Winnie into the office the next day. The Luckless post went viral, and Inga wants a series. If Winnie goes out with Holden, Inga will make Winnie a columnist, double her salary, and let her create any content she chooses. Winnie doesn't want to date Holden again, but Kira tells Winnie to make it unenjoyable for more blog material. Holden is with Ret recalling the terrible date when he gets Winnie's text message. Ret tells Holden to give Winnie another chance because she is the type of woman who can challenge him. Holden agrees to the second date. Can fake feelings become real over a string of bad dates?<br/><br/>While this movie follows the rom-com format, it's funny enough to keep you watching. Ret and Kyra are the perfect comedic relief for any situation. Don't forget the amazingly horrible dates. They will tickle you and be a flashback for some. This film is a classic rom-com. It's worth two hours and ends with an epic grand gesture apology.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Paris Proposal",
    "review":"Anna calls Sebastian repeatedly because he is late for the meeting. During another call, Sebastian walks in with the client's product and tells her to sample it. Anna starts to break down demographics then Sebastian interrupts with a commercial pitch. While the clients love the proposal, Anna tells them it would be an insurance liability. She promises to come up with something that works and is budget-friendly.<br/><br/>Anna and Sebastian walk back to their office headquarters, arguing about the meeting. She doesn't think Sebastian respects her job, but he believes she doesn't dream big enough. Their boss, Caroline, stops Anna and tells Anna about an opportunity. Durand Diamonds, a Parisian jeweler, wants to expand into the American market. Sebastian's family owns a store in Paris and is friends with the Durands. So, Sebastian is coming with Anna to Paris. Anna does a double-take because Paris isn't a dream destination for her. It holds a bad memory. But Anna doesn't explain that to Caroline and goes to Paris with Sebastian.<br/><br/>Sebastian and Anna meet with the Durands after landing in Paris. Sebastian catches up with them when Anna sees a man who looks like her ex-husband. Mrs. Durand asks Anna when was the last time she traveled to Paris. Anna says, looking in the man's direction, 'since our honeymoon.' The Durands assume that Sebastian and Anna are married. The Durands offer them a room at a better hotel and leave. Anna panics, but Sebastian remains calm. She wants to tell the truth, but Sebastian thinks this will give them a leg up. So they will go with the lie to get the job and create a break-up when the Durands sign the contract. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie gives an international flare to a predictable plot. The characters are fun, but the storyline offers nothing new or intriguing. One question that goes unanswered: 'Did Anna see her ex-husband?' The momentary spark that sets off the movie's problem never comes full circle. You will need to pay attention because of the subtitles, but the rest is backburner material.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
