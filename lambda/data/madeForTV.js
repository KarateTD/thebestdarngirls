    "review":"Thirteen years ago, Lilly was assigned a penpal for school.  The students were told to write to each other for the entire school year.  After the year was over, they could decide if they wanted to keep writing or not.  Lilly was assigned Molly in Nebraska.  The girls wrote, emailed, and later, friended each other online.  One day, Molly went radio silent.  When Lilly was ready to cut off the friendship, Molly finally wrote back and wants to be friends again.  Lilly is happy to reconnect.  A few days later, Lilly arrives home to a surprise birthday party thrown by her boyfriend Matthew.  Matthew’s biggest surprise, Molly.  Molly flew from Nebraska to Seattle to have a real face-to-face friendship.  Molly is overstaying her welcome and Lilly wants her out.  Molly is dressing like her, coming on to Matthew, and Lilly’s things are going missing.  Lilly has no idea how unhinged Molly can get.<br/><br/>Unlike most Lifetime movies, Lilly isn’t clueless.  The first moment Molly steps out of line, Lilly calls her on it.  She has both eyes open and questions everything Molly does.  When things don’t line up, Lilly starts to do her homework.  It’s not long before she is telling Molly to leave her home and putting up other boundaries.  Don’t miss the first 5 minutes.   It is the complete setup for the movie and getting to know the characters.  Also, see if you can spot another stereotype this movie breaks.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
