    "review":"After putting her detailed touches on the Signature League Christmas Gala, Hayley heads to her sister's in-laws' vacation home for the holidays.  Hayley drives to the Barnetts' vacation home and gets a call from her sister, Amy.  Before Amy can say a word, Hayley assures Amy she is on her way. Hayley is happy that Amy's brother-in-law, Paul, won't be there.  However, Amy didn't tell Hayley that Paul would be there for one day because she was afraid Hayley wouldn't come.  When Hayley gets to the vacation home, Tim, Amy's husband, spills the beans. At first, Hayley is happy to stay because Paul will be there for a day, but when his stay changes to a week, she has to get her feelings off her chest.  During Amy and Tim's wedding, Paul told Hayley that he believed her boyfriend would leave for Europe and not take her.  She sat her boyfriend down to talk, and before the reception ended, their relationship was over. Since then, Hayley blamed Paul for the break-up and plans to avoid him every chance she gets.  However, the Barnetts' daily scheduled activities make it difficult. They try to keep their distance, but when Judy gets sick and can't finish the town's Christmas Gala, Hayley takes the lead.  Soon, it will be Hayley and Paul side by side, but will Paul's ambition to travel and Hayley's insecurity get in the way?<br/><br/>While the movie is watchable, it doesn't offer much else.  Once the plot reveals the issues of the past, you will start to lose interest. This film won't be a classic or a favorite for the season.  But it's a decent watch with a glass of wine.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amelia will finally accomplish her dream of opening a year-round Christmas store.  She needs the seller to approve her all-cash offer on her dream property. Another buyer has made an attractive offer too.  Just as Amelia inquires about the other buyer, Victor walks in.  Amelia remembers Victor from an early spat about a parking space and instant karma.  Victor is the other buyer.  While he isn't paying cash, he is offering over the asking price for the property.  Amelia knows his offer could derail her dream, so her friend tells her to find the seller and convince him to give her the property. She heads to see him, but the snow starts to fall heavy and thick.  So she stops at a hotel, but they have no vacancies.  The hotel clerk gave the last available room to Victor.  He has the same plan as Amelia, and it will be a race to the clock.  After an unpleasant night in a hotel room, Victor and Amelia meet Elder face-to-face and plead their case. However, he can't focus on selling his store because Elder is in charge of the Mainstreet Association Christmas decorations.  Each year the main street of Castle Creek and Crystal compete in a Christmas Decorating competition.  For the last five years, Castle Creek lost.  Elder must work hard with the local store owners to win this year. Amelia chimed in to help, and she offers to work with the neighbors to make Castle Creek a winner.  Amelia wants to get in Elder's good graces, and Victor sees it.  So, he offers to help too.  As these two try to put a disjointed town together, they will fix Elder's relationship with his daughter and their relationship with each other.<br/><br/>While seeing Amelia and Victor one-up each other is a good laugh, it's the town's people, especially Rowena, that will keep you watching.  During the movie, both Victor and Amelia explain their passion for what they do and accomplish.  It's hard for the viewer to determine who should have it in the end. This film is one to enjoy with the whole family.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Darcy works for GUMM Public Relations, and she faced the biggest disappointment of her career.  She lost the Campaign of the Year award.  As she licks her wounds, she gets an alert on her phone.  The press is dragging Austin Inc's name through the mud.  The press doesn't believe the late CEO's son, William Austin, has the same drive or vision as his father. Darcy knows Austin's communication department must be falling apart, so she goes to her office and creates a strategy. Darcy calls Austin Inc's Vice President of Communications, Glen.  She tells him that GUMM didn't present the pitch she created, and she wants another shot to generate great PR for them.  At first, Glen says no.  But Darcy convinces him that using this charity's Christmas show could drum up positive press for William Austin and the company.  After some verbal sparring, Glen asks Darcy to leave Kansas City and fly to New York to help with the charity event.  After an awkward run-in at the hotel bar, they plan to meet at the charity headquarters in the morning.  The next day, she meets with the other team members, Jackie, Riley, and Bridget.  If Darcy can generate great PR while working for the charity for three weeks, pro bono, Glen will make sure GUMM gets the Austin Inc account.  Darcy agrees to do the work, but at some point, she wants to meet the elusive William Austin, face-to-face. Can Darcy pull the team and the event together? If not, she could lose it all.<br/><br/>Inspired by the Wizard of Oz, some items, influenced by the movie, are easy to spot, like ruby red slippers.  Others will be harder to spot, like the yellow brick road, but keep your eyes and ears open for the sight or mention of iconic items.  While this movie is the classic at heart, it doesn't retell it with a modern twist. This film does follow the Hallmark format, but you are so focused on the parallels between the two movies, you don't pay attention to anything else.  This film won't be a classic, but it will be a season favorite.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
