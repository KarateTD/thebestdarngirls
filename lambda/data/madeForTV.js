    "review":"Tara is envious of her best friend, Jenny.  Jenny met her birth mom, who lets her do whatever she wants.  Now, Tara wants to meet her birth mom.  Tara's adoptive mom says no because the adoption agency warned her to keep Tara away from her birth mom.  After a medical scare, both Tara and Amy are curious and start the process in secret.  Tara takes a DNA test to find her mother while Amy calls the adoption agency.  Tara gets her results and meets with her birth mother, Grace, in secret.  Tara mentions Amy contacted the adoption agency for records putting Grace on notice.  So, Grace finds the agent and kills her. Amy calls Grace and sets up a meeting.  Amy and Grace talk until Amy is comfortable introducing Grace to Tara.  A few days later, Amy has a surprise for Tara.  She introduces Tara to her birth mother, Grace. Tara pretends it's the first time.  They sit, look at photos, and laugh, but Grace tries to make a quick exit and has a fainting spell.  Amy insists that Grace spends the night, then the madness begins.<br/><br/>Lifetimers, you get a shovel and a great plot twist.  For the first thirty minutes, you believe you know where the plot is going.  So you will be tempted to divert your attention.  It is a huge mistake.  This movie saves itself from the Lifetime chiches by given you in the twist early.  You become so preoccupied with the plot that you can't turn away.  This movie deserves your full attention with tea to sip and pearls to clutch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jason Quinn is a success in his father, William's company, but he wants to quit and work as a landscaping architect.  He plans on giving William the news after his brother, Tim's, wedding. During their talk, Jason and Tim's sisters interrupt.  Amanda and Lisa double-check with Jason and Tim about the wedding week. Amanda and Lisa have something up their sleeve for Jason.  They worry about him being single for the wedding and secretly invited his ex-girlfriend Cassie to the wedding. Jason prepares for an interview with a potential chef for their spas and resorts.  Molly has an interview with Williams Spa and Resort, but her van breaks down on the way.  She asks her sister, Sarah, to run to the meeting and give the presentation. The moment Sarah and Jason lay eyes on each other, their tempers flare.  At 2 am the night before, she was cooking, singing, and dancing in heels right above Jason's head.  Jason, tired and angry, begrudgingly came upstairs to give her a piece of his mind.  Now, Sarah gives the presentation, but Jason feels her food isn't healthy enough for his clients. Sarah tells Molly she lost the interview, so they will have to come up with another plan.  The plan will come from Jason.  Worried about what his sisters have in store for him, Jason offers Sarah a deal.  If she goes to all the wedding activities and the wedding with him as his date, he will give them the final interview with his father.  For her sister, Sarah says yes. While keeping this secret, they fall in love.<br/><br/>With a plotline set up for a lot of funny moments, the movie gets serious with adoption woes, a marriage falling apart, and self-doubt.  The biggest downfall is too many characters. If you remove Molly's storyline, it will not affect the plot.  Also, Amanda and her husband, Henry, are arguing about preparation before their adoption confirmation. While this is a heartfelt addition, it feels like a time filler.  The next issue is hair and make-up.  The actresses for Lisa, Cassie, Amanda, and Nicole look too similar. Changes in hair and make-up would make it less confusing for viewers.  Don't be mistaken; the story was strong.  It was the subplots that cluttered the screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
