    "mtitle": "Robin Roberts Presents: I Will Survive: The Gloria Gaynor Story",
    "review": "Gloria fusses with her dress as her mother, Queenie Mae, makes alterations and fixes Gloria's hair. Queenie Mae says it's God's design to have Gloria sing. Queenie Mae leaves the room while Gloria gabs with her sister Irma. Then they hear a horrible thud. Their mother is dead.<br/><br/>Months later, Gloria performs through the emotional pain as Irma cheers for Gloria. After the show, Music Manager Michael enters Gloria's dressing room. He wants to manage her career and make Gloria a household name, but first, she needs a band. He introduces Gloria to City Life, and they start making music. Soon, Michael's promises come true.<br/><br/>Gloria goes on tour and gains two backup singers. She hangs out with them after a show and flips through a photobook. She sees a picture of a handsome man. It's the singer's brother, Officer Linwood. Gloria declares he will be her husband. Her connection to Linwood pushes her to her limits and away from God while she climbs the charts. Can Gloria find her way back to God while losing everything?<br/><br/>Gloria Gaynor's story goes beyond one song or genre of music. And it continues to this day. She finds the typical pitfalls in music with poor management and contracts. Her story is unique because she always found strength through her faith during her darkest hours. This subplot circles back to Gloria's final career decision at the movie's conclusion. The film gives the audience a glimpse into Gloria's personal and professional struggles but won't garner new fans. However, it will solidify her current audience.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Reality Bites: A Hannah Swensen Mystery",
    "review": "The Cookie Jar bakery is abuzz. A cooking show star, Connie Mac, will use Hannah's bakery to film on location. The producer, Hunt, meets with Hannah before the crew arrives. Connie doesn't have time to make the food herself, so the crew assists while Connie hosts.<br/><br/>Detective Lonny and District Attorney Chad compare notes before Chad's case at the Lake Eden Municipal Building. They caught a serial burglar who hit 13 homes. Chad will litigate the case against him, and Lonny will be the first witness.<br/><br/>Hannah arrives at her bakery, and Hunt introduces Hannah to the team. Costume designer Louise gives Hannah a branded apron. Food stylist Evan hands Hannah a list of the recipes. Minutes before they air, Connie enters and briefly waves at Hannah. Hannah is in awe until she discovers Connie's secret: Connie can't cook. She pulls Hunt aside, and he agrees to discuss the matter with her later.<br/><br/>Hunt explains that his mentor, Buddy, created the show. Buddy believed a female host would appeal more to a female audience, so Buddy chose Connie to host the show instead of Hunt. Hunt wants to elaborate, but Hannah has plans. She gives Hunt a key to the bakery so he can set up before the crew shows up.<br/><br/>Hannah arrives at her shop, and the crew is waiting outside. Hannah opens the door and finds Hunt dead on the ground. The police shut down the show and the bakery because now it's a crime scene. Hannah's shocked when the medical examiner wants to declare Hunt's death due to natural cases. Then, Hannah remembers an article about the burglaries on Hunt's computer at the scene. Lonny believes Hannah is correct. Chad tells Lonny to investigate Hunt's death as a murder until Lonny proves otherwise. Can they discover who killed Hunt and why?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Blueberry Muffin Murder by Joanne Fluke, this movie is top-notch sleuthing with humorous quips and excellent character growth. The plot offers several suspects but doesn't lead you to the killer. It allows the final reveal to be a surprise. And all the plot points will converge on one scene. This film is one of the best in the Hannah Swensen series. It's comical, romantic, and compelling.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Murder in Nashville",
    "review": "Eden enters Callahan Legacy Records and meets Lily Callahan. Lily handles the company's executive administrative tasks. Lily introduces Eden to her father, CEO Burt, and brother, President Jax. Eden will handle the label's philanthropic efforts and connect their artist to different charities. Jax takes Eden out for lunch to help Eden get comfortable.<br/><br/>Later, Eden and Jax bond over music and their families. Jax drives Eden to the company's house. They can't deny their attraction to each other.<br/><br/>Eden meets with a singer, Savannah, and asks her to help a woman's charity get more recognition. Savannah turns down the offer. Later, Savannah calls Eden while Eden is with the Callahans. Savannah begs Eden to come to her home and tell no one.<br/><br/>Eden arrives at Savannah's home and finds the door open. Eden cautiously enters and finds Savannah bleeding on the ground. Savannah warns Eden that Eden's in danger. A person attacks Eden, and Eden fights back. Eden stabs the attacker, and the attacker runs away. Later, Eden learns that Savannah died. Police deduce it was a robbery gone wrong. The Callahans worry that Eden isn't safe alone and asks her to stay with them. Eden, falling for Jax, thinks she's safe. She's wrong. The Callahan's legacy goes beyond music, and it's deadly.<br/><br/>This film will drive Lifetimers up the wall. The script allows Eden to ignore blaring signs of the Callahans's misgivings. The wardrobe is immaculate, but the make-up is distracting. The last commercial break makes the storyline confusing and disjointed. If you can handle Eden's horrible judgment, then watch this film. Otherwise, it's Lifetime rage bait.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "An Unexpected Valentine",
    "review": "Hannah introduces a new line of Valentine's products, and her boss, Annalisa, loves them. She wants Hannah to attend a company party today at 9 p.m. to show the products to investors and the press. Hannah calls a rideshare, and the driver, photographer Finn, picks her up. She mistakenly got the pool option. Gabby is in the passenger seat, lovebirds Nadine and Nate are in the middle, so Hannah sits in the back.<br/><br/>Hannah feels nauseous during the ride and switches seats with Gabby. Finn drops off the couple and Gabby first. Hannah gets to her destination but realizes she doesn't have her phone. She and Finn look through the car. Hannah discovers her cell phone and an engagement ring. Since tonight is Valentine's Day, they may want to propose this evening. Hannah wants to find the owner and return the ring. However, Finn wants to call the rideshare's lost and found number. He has a gallery showing later that evening and can't be late. Hannah believes they can find the passengers and fulfill their obligations to the gallery and company party. Love cynic Finn relents and allows romance-hopeful Hannah to come along. These two will have an unexpected Valentine's Day to remember.<br/><br/>Hannah and Finn have several first dates in a few hours. They are genuinely kind and loving towards each other throughout the film. The script allows Hannah and Finn to learn about each other and grow. You will root for them to become a couple at the end. This movie will be a favorite all year long.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Can You Feel the Beat: The Lisa Lisa Story",
    "review": "Lisa Velez dances with her headphones on, and her father hits her from behind. Lisa begs Mrs. Velez to call the police, but she won't. Lisa puts on her headphones and escapes into the music.<br/><br/>Mrs. Velez leaves Mr. Velez, and Lisa's brother, Eladio, helps Mrs. Velez care for the family. He urges Lisa to get a job and stop dreaming about being a singer. A co-worker says he knows Jellybean and can introduce Lisa. Lisa takes her co-workers and Eladio to the club. Her co-worker admits he doesn't know Jellybean and Brit leaves. Lisa stands by the side of the bar, and Toni spies Lisa's scheming. She tells Lisa to grab a tray to get backstage. Lisa takes her advice.<br/><br/>Jellybean talks to his bandmates Mike and Spandador. Mike wants to start a band but can't find a singer. Lisa enters the room and sings. She blows them away, and Mike gives Lisa his number. Later, Lisa shows executive Barry and manager Rocco her undeniable talent. They offered Lisa a contract, but she's underage. Lisa brought Mrs. Velez to the studio and begged her to sign it. Mrs. Velez doesn't trust them, but Lisa pleads with her mom. Lisa wants to make her family's dreams come true. Mrs. Velez gives in to Lisa. Lisa sees her historic future ahead of her but doesn't see the physical, emotional, and mental toll it will take on her personal and professional life.<br/><br/>This movie embodies the late 1980s with fashion and technology. The musical montages set the mood by playing historical clips covering politics, sports, and TV. The lead actress mastered Lisa's distinct voice and choreography. This film will gain new fans while long-time fans will dance and remember good times. It doesn't give you all the details, but you will watch with satisfaction.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
