    "mtitle":"V.C. Andrews' Dawn: Midnight Whispers",
    "review":"It's Christie's 16th birthday, and the Cutlers will throw a lavish party at Cutler's Cove. The hotel runs like a well-oiled machine with Dawn's husband, Jimmy, by her side. Before the party, Dawn sits Christie down and tells her about her birth father, Michael. Then, Dawn warns Christie about the family curse, but they are interrupted before Dawn gives Christie more details.<br/><br/>During the party, everyone notices Philip fawning over his sister, Dawn, including Philip's wife, Betty, Jimmy, and Christie. Jimmy separates them after Betty angrily leaves. In the basement, Betty finds Philip's key and opens his secret room. Inside the room, she finds creepy mementos and photos of Dawn. Betty confronts Philip, but he attacks and threatens her.<br/><br/>Jimmy walks to the basement to repair issues, and Philip sees him. Philip attacks Jimmy. Then Philip leaves Jimmy bleeding on the floor, unconscious, with the gas leaking. Dawn smells the gas, remembers Jimmy's repairs, and tells Mrs. Boston to escort the guests out. Dawn finds Jimmy and stays until help arrives. However, Cutler's Cove explodes and kills them both. Betty informs Christie that she and Philip are Christie and Jefferson's legal guardians. Christie tries to grit her teeth and bear living with a vengeful aunt and delusional uncle, but the Cutler curse will rear its ugly head. Can Christie break the generational curse or fall victim like her mother?<br/><br/>Based on Midnight Whispers by V.C. Andrews, this fourth film gives the children a conclusion but kills off well-known characters. If you listen closely, Charlotte gives a brief synopsis of the 5th book while giving Christie information about Dawn's taxing upbringing. This movie doesn't pack the shock of the previous three films but brings karma to evil characters. This film won't be your favorite of the series, but it's worth the watch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

They don't remember anything, but they notice Anna Maria is missing. They must find clues to locate Anna Maria and get her to her father's wedding. Can they find Anna Maria in time and safe?<br/><br/>Based on The Sleepover by Jen Malone, this movie has the fun of Hangover without drugs, cursing, or sex. Each young woman has issues in their family and friend group. This adventure bonds them with a hedgehog, onions, and trespassing. This film is on the Disney Channel but is more appropriate for tweens and teens. And parents will do a mental side-by-side comparison with the first Hangover film. This movie is funny and charming.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Beware The Night Nurse",
    "review":"Zach and Claire are happy to bring their new baby boy, Owen, home for the first time. However, Owen cries all night, and the couple can't sleep. Claire expresses frustration to her surrogate, Liz, and worries about her ability to be a mother. Liz assures Claire that she is a great mom, at least compared to the one Liz had.<br/><br/>After more nights of zero sleep, Zach suggests they get a night nurse, but Claire isn't sure. Claire calls Liz for their lunch date, but Liz doesn't answer. She decides to visit Liz's home after a disturbing call. Claire finds Liz in a panic with luggage. Liz tells Claire she is leaving and not to follow. The next day, a cop comes to Zach and Claire's home and questions them about Liz. They found Liz's abandoned car near a lake where people committed suicide. They believe Liz did the same.<br/><br/>At a wake, a passerby, Vera, hears Owen's cries from Zach's car. She offers to hold the baby. When Owen stops crying, Zach wants to hire Vera on the spot. While Vera makes off-putting comments, Claire and Zach love having Vera around. However, Zach's mother, Judy, turns everything around. She doesn't approve of Claire's housekeeping, cooking, or decorating. Claire assumes Judy is the problem, but Claire must put her issues aside to see the real danger. Someone wants Owen and won't stop until they get him.<br/><br/>This movie starts with classic Lifetime mistakes. Zach and Claire let a stranger hold their baby and call one reference. While Judy is right to have concerns, her relationship with Claire is combative. So, Claire often rebels against her advice and assistance. When Claire and Judy come together for Owen's safety, it's a beautiful bond. This movie has a strong message about generational gender preference and its lasting effect. So leave the tea alone and break out the wine. This movie is a compelling ride.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Mother's Intuition",
    "review":"Toni never thought she would go through pregnancy alone, but she lost her husband before she knew. She regularly takes anti-anxiety medication and sees her OB/GYN, Dr. Synder. Dr. Synder finds a cyst on Toni's ovaries but wants to ignore it. This advice doesn't sit well with Toni, so she discusses her feelings with her friend, Cicely. Cicely warns Toni to see another doctor. Toni decides to stick with her doctor and hospital because they are familiar.<br/><br/>Toni visits a hardware store to find a stone for her bust. Julian, her college ex-boyfriend, approaches. The two make plans and connect over the coming weeks. Toni's water breaks, and she races to the hospital. She delivers a baby girl and falls asleep. Toni sees a woman with red-streaked hair take the baby away before falling asleep again. Later, Dr. Synder tells Toni that her baby is dead. They offer to bring the baby into the room so Toni can say goodbye. Toni takes one look at the baby and says it's not hers. She believes someone at the hospital stole her child. But can she prove it?<br/><br/>This movie gives a voice to women dealing with medical professionals. Doctors label them difficult or emotional instead of listening. It helps the audience see that loyalty is not for doctors; it's for your health. As the story continues, the plot makes you question Toni's sanity. It's a tricky tactic, but it draws your attention. This film also shines a light on hospitals being bad actors for horrible doctors. Dr. Death proves this happens more than you know. This film is disturbing but intriguing to watch.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
