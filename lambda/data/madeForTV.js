    "review":"Karla, Joli, Sharell, and Rebel planned a phone-free girl's trip at an exclusive spa. They board a private plane to the spa. Later, Karla wakes up in a field with burning plane wreckage around her. She stumbles around the site and finds Joli with an injured leg and Sharell. They yelled for Rebel, but she did not survive.<br/><br/>Karla's husband, Mark, invites Joli's husband, Jared, Rebel's husband, Evan, and Sharell's husband, Andre, into his screening room. Mark turns on the TV to watch the feed of the women in the woods. At first, Jared, Evan, and Andre think it's a joke or a new reality show. However, Mark tells them it's real and part of his plan. They will all be free of their problem if the women die. When Evan doesn't see Rebel on camera, he questions Mark. Mark congratulates Evan on getting the bonus prize because Rebel died on impact. Evan flies into a rage and tries to attack Mark, but Mark pulls out a gun and forces Evan into a panic room. Mark locks the door behind Evan and returns to the screening room. Andre and Jared privately discuss a way to save their wives while escaping a madman. Will Joli, Sharell, and Karla make it out alive?<br/><br/>This movie is a compelling idea with poor execution. The message is about housewives, lost in marriages, finding their self-worth to escape their husbands' control. However, this empowerment plot becomes hindered by bad acting, horrible graphics, and flat jokes. If you are not a Real Housewives fan, skip this film.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Candace finishes teaching her spin class and approaches a student, Kristen, with a black eye. Kristen says she is okay, explains, and leaves. Candace enters her van's passenger side and allows her daughter, student driver Avery, to take the wheel. Before they leave the parking lot, the car stalls. Candace promises Avery to have a mechanic work on it.<br/><br/>Candace meets with the mechanic, Mike. Candace asks Mike to examine the car for necessary fixes to make the vehicle safe and sits in the waiting area. Kristen and Candace recognize each other. They decide to get lunch together because their repairs will take a while. Kristen takes Candace to the restaurant she shares with her husband, Nathan. Kristen reveals that Candace's fears were correct. Nathan physically and financially abuses her while he cheats with the staff. And if she leaves, she will lose everything. Candace tells Kristen about her mother-in-law, Iris. Candace tries to keep the peace for Avery's sake, but Iris undermines, belittles, and argues with Candace whenever they talk. Kristen says they should kill each other's problem. Candace believes Kristen is joking until Kristen plots. Candace leaves the restaurant and walks to the body shop. Kristen chases after Candace, pays for Candace's repairs in cash, and apologizes.<br/><br/>Kristen returns home to Nathan. After days of mistreatment, Kristen drugs Nathan and slips out of the house. She finds Iris and kills her. Later, Kristen confronts Candace. Since she did her part, she expects Candace to return the favor. Then, Kristen plays the tape of them in the restaurant. Kristen will take the tape, implicating them both, to the police if Candace doesn't kill Nathan. Can Candace escape, or will she become a murderer?<br/><br/>This Strangers on a Train twist has all the intrigue of its inspiration. Kristen, like Bruno, commits the crime and blackmails Candace to do the same. Candace, like Guy, tries to avoid Kristen and stay a step ahead. This cat-and-mouse game will keep you on the edge of your seat. But wait until the end. One final smirking glance will make you question who was actually in control.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The Thundermans save the world from a meteor shower and head to Thunderman Tower. They beam with pride because they don't have to hide their identities. Hank and Barb want to settle and enjoy time with the family after a successful mission, but Phoebe wants to analyze her 27-point mission review.<br/><br/>Later, they get an emergency call. The Blue Flame is breaking into a bank. Phoebe wants to stop him, but Hank and Barb tell Phoebe to let the V-Team handle it because T-Force is off duty. T-Force battles Blue Flame, but he is ready for them. Then, V-Team shows up. Phoebe demands they retreat, but a member of the V-Team gets hurt in the battle by The Thundermans.

Max wants to keep this from Phoebe, but she figured it out. Can they stop the V-Team without their family?<br/><br/>Fans of the Thundermans unite. This movie doesn't pick up where the series left off. However, it fast-forwards their story enough to relate to their fans while gaining more. It has campy humor, a compelling plot, and twists. Also, the ending leaves the film open for another movie or a revamp of the TV show. The graphics aren't stellar but effective for the audience. This movie is perfect for its intended demographic but could bore others.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Molly's boss, Regina, informs Molly that Molly is in the running for a promotion to full-time content creator. Regina's daughter created a subscription box for singles, and Regina wants to create elevated content incorporating items in the box.<br/><br/>Jackson runs a charity to help kids discover the arts and needs donations to help the charity reach more people. His friend, Dave, tells Jackson that Mr. Larson wants to invest but needs to see more social media engagement. Jackson walks home and sees Molly fumbling with an object and offers advice. She thanks him but doesn't take it.<br/><br/>Molly goes to a cooking class for singles and sees Jackson talking to a woman. She starts filming for content while he stumbles and causes a fire.

Molly offers to be Jackson's wingman if he shows her the best places for singles. Will guiding each other help them find love or bring their professional downfall?<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is interesting, but the main characters have zero chemistry. The plot has a searing examination of content creators but not much else. This film does not 'Bring the Spring' to a positive start for the 2024 season.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
