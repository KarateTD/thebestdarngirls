    "review":"Jada happily agrees to watch her niece, Olivia, while her identical twin sister, Kayla, finalizes her lease.  Since Kayla separated from her husband, Warren, her old habits returned.  A new place will be the fresh start Kayla needs.  Kayla admits that she owes the landlord $2000 for the deposit and first and last month's rent.  Like Kayla, Jada is a single mom too.  Jada and her estranged husband, Terrell, co-parent their daughter, Meagan, during their divorce, so money in Jada's home is scarce.  After a heated exchange about responsibility, Jada writes Kayla a check for $2000.  Kayla leaves and promises to return with the keys to her new apartment.  When Kayla doesn't show, Jada starts to worry that Kayla gave into her demons.  After a few more days, Jada goes to the police to report Kayla missing.  Two detectives take the case and promise to keep Jada informed.  While looking for anything to help, Jada puts on Kayla's wig and make-up and gets an idea.  Jada will pretend to be Kayla to find out what happened to her sister.  Even if that means she loses it all.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the story of Jody and Jenny LeCornu, this movie provides consistent entertainment with no lag and much intrigue.  Jada has to weave through exes, criminals, and party girls for the truth. But this movie is authentic because everyone doesn't let Jada leave her responsibilities to investigate the crime.  Terrell, the detectives, and her boss hold Jada responsible when she endangers herself and misses work.  This switch grounds the movie into reality.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sylvia is a renowned jewelry designer who secretly dates a co-worker, Jesse.  One day, Sylvia gets an invite to join the Female Leadership Society.  Although Jesse tells Sylvia not to join, she thinks it can help her make connections, especially after the nerve-racking article about her came out.  It discussed the estranged relationship with her father, Earl.  Against Jesse's wishes, Sylvia accepts the invite.<br/><br/>Before the Society mixer, a man grabs Sylvia off the street and throws her into a car.  They pull up to a house and the man, Russo, lets Sylvia out.  Make-up guru Kat introduces herself, Russo, and their leader, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth apologizes for their tactics but does it to protect the Society.  The women talk and notice Kat's ring.  Immediately Sylvia recognizes the design as one of her rejects.  Sylvia stays mum but walks away to talk on the phone and call Jesse.  Vanessa walks up to Sylvia while Sylvia is on the phone and warns Sylvia that phones are not permitted.  Sylvia quickly hangs up.<br/><br/>Sylvia goes home with a new fresh set of contacts and her nerves gathered, but her front door is open.  She goes inside to investigate.  A masked man pushes her to the ground and runs out, inducing Sylvia's panic attack.  Later, Sylvia tells her best friend, Claire, about the attack.  Sylvia hopes this is the end, but she is wrong.<br/><br/>This movie mixes NXIVM with corporate espionage and embattled family ties to create a mystery.  While it starts strong, it does drag a bit in the middle.  But don't write it off just yet.  The lag allows the script to unmask the attacker, like peeling back an onion.  Sylvia learns to trust herself personally and professionally.  And that's the takeaway of this film, not the whodunit.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Maggie helped her mother, Kate, during Kate's depression after Maggie's father died.  Now, Kate is running a successful bakery with her friend, Amy.  Nervous, Maggie enters her new school and meets Kurt.  Then Maggie runs into Laurel.  Laurel politely teases Maggie about liking Kurt, and they have lunch together.

When Maggie talks to Laurel, Laurel explains it all away and persuades Maggie to go to Kurt's party.  Maggie throws caution to the wind and goes.  However, plans change on their way to Kurt's.  Instead, Laurel decides to go to a club because her friend, Dan, will sneak them inside.  But she doesn't know that Dan has plans for her.  And he is using Laurel to reel Maggie into a trap.<br/><br/>Before you get upset with Maggie, remember teens are aloof to the dangers around them.  One 'friend' can direct you down the wrong path if you trust them. It's the tale of Zola.  One person convinces you to have fun with them and changes plans along the way.  You have no recourse or escape.  This movie shouldn't be a cause of frustration but a warning for your teen.  Be careful of the company you keep.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
