    "review": "Carl and Jessica watch their daughter, Rhiannon, leave with her boyfriend, Derek. Then, they get a call from their adoption specialist, Maya. Unfortunately, another mother rejected them for her child. However, Maya has an alternative. She has an 8-year-old girl, Gabby, with special needs looking for a forever home. Jessica and Carl ask for time to think about it. Later, Jessica reads the girl's life story and finds similarities. She and Carl decide to adopt the child.<br/><br/>Gabby takes a girl's family drawing and pays her with stolen money. Maya looks at Gabby's picture and tells Gabby that Carl and Jessica have a 15-year-old daughter. Gabby sighs deeply and corrects the drawing. Carl and Jessica meet Gabby and welcome Gabby to their home.<br/><br/>Jessica takes Gabby to an open house because Gabby hasn't enrolled in school. Gabby asks to go to a movie instead, but Jessica says no. Jessica prepares cookies for potential buyers, and Gabby offers to help. A couple enters the home because the wife left her cell phone. Jessica calls the phone to locate it and finds Gabby covering it in cookie dough. Gabby smiles and says she is helping. However, Jessica believes there's more to the story. Jessica reveals to a friend, Lani, that Gabby could be older than she appears. Can Jessica uncover the truth before Gabby takes over the family?<br/><br/>Inspired by the story of Natalie Grace, this movie's conclusion has a wild twist. Some viewers will love it, but it could turn off others. Either way, the script allows viewers to decide if Gabby is crazy, manipulative, or both. Did Jessica go too far to prove Gabby's age?This film is a crazy ride with a surprising twist that will divide viewers, but it needs part 2: The Bad Orphan: Jessica's Revenge.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "My Two Husbands",
    "review": "Eliza returns from Switzerland and meets her dad, Dane, and Dane's girlfriend, Brooke, for dinner. Dane confesses they eloped in Las Vegas. Eliza screams because someone murdered her mother, Maureen, six months ago. Dane reminds Eliza that he and Maureen got a divorce five years ago. Eliza runs out of the restaurant and gets hit by a car.<br/><br/>Eliza talks to her aunt, Carly, after pushing Dane out of the hospital room. Carly tells Eliza that hating Brooke will only hurt Dane. A few days later, Eliza leaves the hospital and enters Dane's home as Brooke leaves. The two women exchange hostile words before flight attendant Brooke goes to work.<br/><br/>Brooke lands and meets her husband, Stefan. Brooke gives Stefan an expensive necklace so he can sell it for cash. Stefan is converting an old church into a nightclub. However, he borrowed money from loan sharks to cover the cost. And they want him to pay now. Brooke warns Stefan that Eliza could be a problem. Stefan scoffs at Brooke's concerns and tells her to finish the job.<br/><br/>Eliza asks her friend, Star, to meet at a local nightclub. Eliza reveals that Maureen died in a parking lot close to the bar. She wants to interview people slyly. Eliza and Star ask the bartender, Gus, questions, but he doesn't have answers. They leave, and a patron, Flo, catches up to them. She offers to give Eliza information for a fee. Everyone leaves as Gus watches them from the bar's window. Gus calls Stefan, and Stefan gives Gus orders to eliminate Eliza. Will Eliza discover Brooke's first husband before Gus kills her?<br/><br/>This movie has an intriguing start with a woman murdered in the parking lot, but she isn't random. The audience discovers this woman is Eliza's mother. This opening scene comes back ten-fold in the story. So, viewers must pay attention. During the movie, Dane and Carly have hushed conversations about a secret between them. This secret isn't necessary to move the story forward and stirs needless drama. This film starts strong but weakens over time. Nevertheless, the characters get just endings.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Danger in the Dorm",
    "review": "Lifelong friends Kathleen and Becky move into their Brighton University dorm room while their mothers, Joanne and Carol, respectively, hover. After their mother's leave, Becky radiates on their future together.<br/><br/>Kathleen looks at the bulletin board for other clubs, and Patrick introduces himself. They have a brief conversation before going their separate ways. Kathleen settles in class, taught by Dean Michael, and Wade asks her for a pen. They playfully banter until Becky sits beside Kathleen. Becky changed all her courses so she could be with Kathleen every day. Kathleen skips lunch to talk to their resident assistant, Sara, to petition for a new dorm room to distance herself from Becky.<br/><br/>Later, Becky confesses that she uses Kathleen as a crutch for friendship and safety. Kathleen sympathizes with Becky and asks Becky to join her at Wade's party. The two girls dance the night away until Becky looks up and doesn't see Kathleen. She panics and runs around the frat house, searching for Kathleen. Conor accosts Becky in the hall. When she rejects his advances, Conor calls her a derogatory name. Patrick interjects, and Becky runs away.<br/><br/>Becky lies in bed with her toy stuffed lamb and pretends to sleep when Kathleen returns. They argue, and Kathleen divulges that she got a new dorm room. Becky drops out of her classes and navigates the university alone. Kathleen goes to the library to study when Wade drops by her desk. Later, she jokingly interrupts him, but he isn't there.<br/><br/>Becky grabs some snacks from the campus store and runs into Conor dressed as a pizza. She blows him off and continues until she sees Patrick. Becky tells Patrick about a scheduled girls' night with a rom-com. Later, Kathleen walks to the dorm and hears murmurs about an attack. Detective Jessica sadly informs Kathleen that Becky is dead. Kathleen can't hide her guilt. That feeling turns to anger when Detective Jessica slips and states someone murdered Becky. Kathleen will do anything to keep other students safe and bring Becky justice. But will she lose her life in the process?<br/><br/>Based on the novel True Crime Archives: Vol 1 by Ann Rule, this movie has a compelling exposition and rising action. Everything after follows the same Lifetime archetype. The conclusion will spark involuntary eye-rolling. Otherwise, two things remain true. Becky is an annoying person who needs to get a life. And Kathleen broke Girl Code by leaving her friend at a party without notice. They were both wrong.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Match for the Prince",
    "review": "Romance novelist Julia puts the finishing touches on her latest novel when her best friend, journalist Franny, rings her bell. Franny and her boyfriend, Whit, have plans to meet at a high-end restaurant, and they celebrate. Franny hopes Whit will propose tonight. They leave for Julia's book reading.<br/><br/>Julia answers fans' questions about love and tells them to never settle for anything less than perfection. A man, Max, stands up and asks what Julia knows about real love because her characters aren't realistic. Max and his sister, Nora, speak to Julia outside the bookstore. They are the Prince and Princess of Valdoria, and Nora enjoys Julia's writing. Nora wants Julia to help Max find love. Julia assumes they are fake.<br/><br/>Later, Julia's mother delivers heartbreaking news. Julia's boyfriend, Steven, broke up with Julia in a family group chat. She dreads going to her family outing single. Franny visits with a glum look because Whit didn't propose.<br/><br/>Julia goes running in the morning and gets cut off by Max. He requests help finding love because the traditional and non-traditional methods haven't worked. Max must get married soon or abdicate the throne. Max gives Julia his business card and offers anything for her assistance. Julia takes his card and leaves because she sees Whit sitting on a bench. Whit admits he wanted to propose but didn't think it was the right time or words. He froze up. Julia promises to help.<br/><br/>Julia meets Franny at home and tells Franny about the Prince. Julia thinks success will elevate her brand and increase her book sales. She meets with Max and agrees to help him find a match, but Max must allow Franny to write the story to guarantee her promotion. Max reluctantly agrees to Julia's terms. Can this expert of fictional love find a match for the Prince?<br/><br/>This movie is well written, like a Jane Austen novel. Julia and Max verbally spar and match wits like a tennis game. This intense delivery will have viewers on the edge of their seats while keeping score. The script makes fun of itself because it discusses going through the story while knowing the conclusion. However, viewers, like readers, stay for the growth. And watching Max and Julia grow is entertaining.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
