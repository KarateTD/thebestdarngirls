    "review":"Emily gets a phone call from Ed Mancini because he needs an event planner for his Christmas Celebration. Ed is Emily's most lucrative client to date. Also, he doesn't want a mall Santa; he wants one of the best in the country. Emily promises to pull it off in a week because he fired the previous planner.<br/><br/>Emily makes phone calls, but finding a fantastic Santa so close to Christmas is complex. As she walks to shops making arrangements, a flyer sticks to her shoe for the Santa Bootcamp. This weeklong course prepares anyone willing to pay the tuition. Emily thinks this is the best place to find her Santa.<br/><br/>Emily walks to the steps of the bootcamp and runs into their chef, Aiden. She sees Patti and asks to speak to the proprietor. Belle approaches, and Emily dismisses Belle as a sweet old lady. Until Emily sees Belle's face on a bus for the bootcamp. Belle offers to give Emily a list of recommendations, but Emily must enroll in the bootcamp to get them.<br/><br/>During their first class, the students get to know each other. Belle calls Emily, and Emily expresses her childhood wish to have a white Christmas. Soon, Belle calls Aiden on stage. After his confession, Belle gives Aiden a scholarship and has him join this year's bootcamp. Emily and Aiden decide to work together to increase Emily's chances of passing and getting Belle's client list for the Christmas Celebration.<br/><br/>This movie has an adorable concept, but the plot doesn't hold your attention until Emily does sign language. The words are on the screen, so you have to pay attention. This film will help parents answer difficult questions about Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the elves. While it's not a standout, this movie is a caring watch to a predictable end, with a bit of Christmas magic thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Allie decides to spend some time with her friend, Lara, and Lara's husband, Derek. Allie boards the plane, but the flight attendant asks Allie to check her bag because the overhead bins are at capacity. The attendant agrees to put the bag in the attendant's area. During the flight, Allie wants wine, but the price point changes her mind. However, an anonymous person buys her drink, and Allie falls asleep. Allie wakes up, grabs her suitcase, and walks to the terminal. Lara picks Allie up and drives to Lara and Derek's lodge. They want to prepare for their first guest, and to Allie's chagrin, earlier, they decided to ask Derek's brother, Jack, for help. Allie didn't want to see Jack because they broke up on bad terms. Allie goes to her room to get a break and discovers the suitcase isn't hers. She deduces that the luggage must belong to M.A. Turner and wants to return it to the author. Allie becomes determined after finding an engagement ring inside. She needs to return the bag to M.A. Turner before Christmas.<br/><br/>M.A. Turner boarded a plane, but their was no space for his luggage. So the attendant placed it in their holding area. During the flight, he heard a woman decline a drink because of the price, and he bought it for her but told the attendant to keep his identity secret. M.A. Turner promised his publicist, Heidi, a completed book before the New Year. The publishing company will ask M.A. to return his $100,000 advance if he doesn't finish the book. M.A. opens his luggage and realizes he got the wrong one, but he lies to Heidi and says he is typing the book. Heidi said she got a call from a woman named Allie. Allie has his manuscript. M.A. assures Heidi that he has a way to get the luggage because he has an inside track to the family. When M.A. and Allie are face-to-face, it will expose years of lies and feelings.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of a slow burn as the first 45 minutes track Allie and her suitcase. The next 45 minutes follow M.A. and the suitcase in his possession. During M.A.'s story, the movie shows interactions with Allie. The last 30 minutes are the aftermath and conclusion of the colliding stories. Everything leading up to the final 30 minutes drags with stares into the abyss or looking deeply into someone's eyes. Although it is entertaining in the end, viewers are likelier to give up on this film than see it through.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Inventing the Christmas Prince",
    "review":"Shelby recites the story of the Christmas Prince to her daughter's class. The prince rules the North Pole, grants wishes for Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the elves, and picks a boy or girl to be king or queen every year. Then he gives that person 12 wishes leading up to Christmas. Shelby tells Grace that she can spot the Christmas Prince by the mark on his hand left by a kiss from Rudolph.<br/><br/>Shelby is a rocket scientist with a Vulcan for a boss. After a successful launch, Shelby's boss, Evan, goes into his office with his boss, Scott. Scott says the board is concerned about Evan's turnover rate. During their exit interviews, they labeled Evan as the problem. If he doesn't do better, the board will fire him. Shelby can see inside Evan's office and knows Evan has problems at work.<br/><br/>Shelby watches Evan emerge from his office the next day, and her co-worker predicts doom and gloom. Evan tells the workers to plan to be at work all day on Christmas Eve and a half day on Christmas. She gathers her things, tells Evan he is unreasonable and quits her job. Then, Grace comes out of the boardroom and notices the mark on Evan's hand. She hugs him and calls him the Christmas Prince.<br/><br/>Grace tells Shelby that Sherman is bullying her about the prince, and she wants to prove the prince exists. Shelby remembers seeing him with Scott and knows Evan's job is on the line. So she goes to Evan with a proposition. If he plays the Christmas Prince, then Shelby will stay. After some words of encouragement from his sister, Evan says yes. Can Shelby and Evan keep the ruse going with Grace's wildly complicated Christmas Wish List?<br/><br/>Give this film time to grow and develop. If you stick it out, the last 10 minutes will leave you in tears. There is one moment when Shelby is 100% unaccommodating, and it's frustrating. She wants Evan to choose between his job and her lie. Shelby struggles to tell Grace the truth, but viewers don't know why until the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After her latest holiday single flops, Chrissy gets a call from her manager, Carole. Chrissy's assistant Eugene tells Chrissy to reign in her hopeful nature and be realistic. Carole tells Chrissy that the record company wants to rebrand her Christmas concert. They will ditch her recent flop and have Chrissy debut a new single during the show. Also, they are changing the location of Chrissy's concert. It will be in her hometown of Cedar Pines. Chrissy panics because she hasn't been to Cedar Pines in 10 years. Carole informs Chrissy that she has to do the concert. And if it's not a success, the label will drop her.<br/><br/>On their way, Chrissy tells Eugene to look out for a handsome man with a jawline that could chop down a Christmas tree. That man, Luke, is Chrissy's ex-boyfriend, and she left him with no warning. After nervously sipping on water, Chrissy runs into a local tavern to use the bathroom. She leaves the restroom, thanking the owner, and runs into Luke. After seeing them stare at each other, Luke's grandmother, Pearl, persuades them to go on a friendly outing.<br/><br/>Chrissy and Luke have a few laughs, but they get honest. He tells Chrissy that she is not authentic and doesn't belong in Cedar Pines. Chrissy apologizes for abandoning him and explains that Luke helped her write honest songs in the past. She pleads with Luke to work with her again on her new Christmas song. Luke says yes, and they start to heal their past one note at a time. But when Carole gets wind of the change, she calls Chrissy's latest ex-boyfriend to gain control.<br/><br/>In all honesty, 'Reindeer Slay' would be a hit if they gave it to a pop princess today. But with Chrissy's soulful past, it flops. For a Lifetime film, it follows the Hallmark formula to a tee. This holiday film doesn't require your full attention, so leave it in the background during your holiday craze.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Carmen offers her favorite customers, Victor and Shirley, some pan de Mallorca. After one bite, they offer Carmen an interview for their Christmas Gala. Carmen tells her family. Her sister, Pilar, and grandmother, Rita, demand Carmen take the job. Carmen looks at the application online and doesn't want to apply because applicants need a culinary degree or a certification. Pilar lies and fills out the application for Carmen.<br/><br/>Carmen walks up to the Lansbury View Hotel with mantecaditos in hand. She turns around to leave and runs into Jax. Jax and his sous chef, Ben, won this competition before. Everyone starts to cook, but Carmen realizes she doesn't have a chef's coat or tools like the other applicants. She is embarrassed, but Jax informs Carmen that the kitchen has everything she needs.<br/><br/>To no one's surprise, Jax wins the executive chef position. However, Carmen gets the pastry chef job. Victor and Shirley tell Jax and Carmen that they have five days to create a holiday menu that works well together. Jax and Carmen walk into the kitchen to plan the menu but realize they have different styles. Jax likes organization, but Carmen leads with passion. Can they create a menu before Jax learns Carmen lied about her credentials?<br/><br/>While the family is fun, the storyline is average for the holidays. The guava pastelitos and chutney will have viewers spending more time looking up recipes than watching the movie. Carmen's family is warm, charming, and the life of the film. But the chemistry between the main characters visibly lacks. This movie is watchable, but it's not a standout for the season with so many holiday movies.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
