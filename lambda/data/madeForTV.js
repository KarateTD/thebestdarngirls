    "mtitle": "Faith in the Flames: The Nichole Jolly Story",
    "review": "Nurse Nichole's husband, Nick, wishes her a happy early birthday after she referees an argument between their sons, Jordan and Logan. Nichole's mother, Heidi, visits before Nichole's shift. Nick reminds Nichole that Jordan has a game today. She's missed every game of the season after promising she would make one. Nichole wants to focus on her patients, but agrees to take Jordan to school.<br/><br/>Nichole and Jordan stop at a local restaurant. She overhears a call on firefighter John's walkie-talkie. The dispatcher alerts him to smoke near the transmission towers. He assures her that everything is okay. Jordan leaves with friends, and Nichole goes to work. Nichole hears about the fire but continues to care for her patients. Then, Heidi calls. She encourages Nichole to leave immediately because the fire is coming. Nichole doesn't know it, but she, her family, and the residents of Paradise are about to encounter the deadliest wildfire in California history.<br/><br/>This film is stupendously shot, scripted, and cast. Viewers will watch in fear as the Jollys battle fire, explosions, and tornadoes. It's admirable to watch Nichole and her colleagues work in literal hell. You will say a quiet prayer for every person on screen. As they drive through the fire, the camera angles allow you to see the devastation around them while witnessing the horror on their faces. It's the definition of terror. The picture concludes with the resulting destruction. And the nightmare is ongoing.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "What Hides in Silence",
    "review": "ASL Interpreter Tiffany is nervous about starting her new job at the local high school. She still thinks about the day she lost a student, Leo, two years ago. A truck struck him, and he died. For two years, Tiffany has lived in her sister's home with Leah and her future brother-in-law, Ryan. Tiffany vows to look for a place to live soon.<br/><br/>Tiffany arrives at the high school, and Principal Warren greets her. Warren informs Tiffany that she will be interpreting for a senior named Amy during summer school. Craig, is on the school board and pulled strings for Tiffany to come to the school. Amy's mother, Natalie, has fired the last five interpreters and doesn't believe they will prepare Amy for the harsh world.<br/><br/>Feeling like a failure, Tiffany walks to her car. Someone cracks the front windshield with a rock. Tiffany spots a note affixed to the rock. It warns Tiffany to quit. Later, Amy runs to the bathroom to cry, and bullies follow. One of the bullies, Brie, tries to console her old friend. However, Amy doesn't understand and shoves Brie, striking her face.<br/><br/>After school, Craig spies Tiffany with a bike and offers her a ride home. He hopes Tiffany will become a part of the family. She pushes the bike up the hill when Natalie yells at Tiffany from her car. Tiffany finally stops and converses with Natalie. Natalie offers Tiffany a ride. Natalie locks Tiffany inside the vehicle and warns to keep Amy on track or else. She unlocks the door and lets Tiffany out. Tiffany prays she can focus on Amy. However, someone is following Tiffany and plotting revenge.<br/><br/>Tiffany is an annoyingly complex character. She gets several warnings about Amy and her family, but ignores them. Each situation draws out the plot and slowly bores the audience. This film is a mystery with zero staying power. Also, experienced Lifetimers will uncover the culprit and the motive before the reveal. This movie doesn't require your undivided attention, but save it for a rainy day and learn American Sign Language.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "If I Go Missing",
    "review": "Sloane goes live about the murder of Beverly Stevens. She was a serial killer's first victim. Sloane believes that if Beverly had her 'If I Go Missing' journal, then Beverly could have saved the killer's other victims. As Sloane signs out, her mother, Jessica, opens Sloane's bedroom door. She asks Sloane to join the family for dinner.<br/><br/>Sloane and Jessica join Jessica's sister, Abby, and Abby's daughter, Camilla, for dinner. Sloane asks if Camilla finished her journal, and Abby tenses. Since someone murdered Sloane's best friend, Katie, two years ago, Sloane has been hyper-focused on safety and true crime stories. Camilla interjects and says she is too busy with school to focus on the journal. Sloane and Camilla leave and walk toward their car. They see the new handsome neighbor moving into the home across the street.<br/><br/>Sloane arrives at work, and her new neighbor, Ethan, enters. Ethan feels uncomfortable and exits. She believes Ethan has the five classic traits of a serial killer: Charming, Manipulative, Narcissistic, Controlling, and A Lack of Empathy. She vows to keep an eye on him.<br/><br/>Sloane watches Ethan from her bedroom window and takes notes about the women coming in and out of his home. When a frequent customer goes missing, Sloane believes Ethan is responsible. She will capture Ethan and make him pay for his crimes.<br/><br/>This writer did a superb job of supplying multiple red herrings throughout this Tubi film. Sloane is a sad representation of the pitfalls of social media. While her behavior started as altruistic, it morphed into 'likes' and 'subscribers.' There could be a part two. However, the story doesn't need it. Your outrage will cause you to think critically before jumping into an online rabbit hole.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Unwrapping Christmas: Mia's Prince",
    "review": "Mia's friends, co-owners Olivia, Lily, and Tina, catch her daydreaming about her favorite literary character, Mr. Wedgwood. Mia and her grandmother flipped through the book, Christmas in Derbyshire, annually during Christmas. The women's store, All Wrapped Up, is sponsoring the town's Christmas Gala, and Mia is in charge of handling the contractors.<br/><br/>Mia leaves the store on her lunch break to visit her favorite place, Arthur's bookstore. He has been saving a book for Mia. It's a first-edition Christmas in Derbyshire, valued at $6000. Mia has been diligently saving her tips in a keepsake box. She plans on buying the book soon.<br/><br/>Mia goes through her Gala checklist when she hears a ruckus at her front door. It's her sister, Ashlyn, with luggage and her cat, Snowball.

He needs a last-minute gift wrapped before he goes to a costume party. He looks the way she imagined Mr. Wedgwood. She opens the door and wraps his gift using the Japanese style, Furoshiki. He offers to pay, but she rejects it. He leaves a $100 tip instead.<br/><br/>Mia recounts her story to Lily, and Lily is overjoyed until she asks for the man's name. Mia never asked, so Lily thinks she dreamed the encounter. She looks for the $100 bill to prove the man is real, but can't find it. She finds the money on the floor and turns to see the handsome man standing behind her. He introduces himself as Beau. His mother's book club needs an activity. So, he requests that Mia teach them Furoshiki. Mia believes her Christmas prince jumped off the page and into her life. But will she feel the same way when she uncovers that her prince is engaged?<br/><br/>This second installment of the Unwrapping Christmas franchise is similar to the first. Mia finds love while finding her voice. She lets her family push her boundaries, but doesn't understand that pitfall until she sees it reflected in Beau. Beau does everything to meet his family's expectations. This sacrifice brings the pair together. his film is a 2-hour escape for Hallmarkies while being evenly yoked with the first.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Little Girl in the Woods",
    "review": "Members of a grief support group go on their annual hike. Evie has the most experience, and the trip means everything to her. Her daughter, Rachel, died on this trail. Former pastor Jan, hiker Bea, and lovelorn Hope welcome their newcomer, nurse Maya, into the group.<br/><br/>They set up camp and turn in for the night. The bear steals Bea's backpack before leaving. In the morning, Evie discovers that Bea brought scented toothpaste on the trip, attracting the bear. But learning that Bea took the map earlier and left it in the bag with the satellite phone causes Evie to rage. If they don't check in, the rangers will send a search party for them. The search will be their fault and cost them thousands of dollars. Evie remembers seeing smoke. She wants to find those hikers and use their phone to alert the rangers.<br/><br/>The group stumbles upon an empty cabin and enters. Evie hears a thump under the floorboards and the women investigate it. They find a little girl named Alice living under the house. She wordlessly relays that she isn't safe. So they take her with them for protection. However, they are in danger. Alice's kidnappers consider Alice to be family. And they are ready to kill to get her back and keep their secret. Will the women make it out of the woods alive?<br/><br/>This film makes the most of its surroundings by having the actors traverse through rugged terrain and snow-covered grounds. They used natural light instead of a soundstage while providing sage advice for campers. The writer had a concrete understanding of wilderness and survival training. Seasoned Lifetimers can easily predict the story's conclusion and the unsurprising reveal. The characters offer astounding advice for dealing with grief, friendship, and healing. While the plot isn't strong, the guidance will renew you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
