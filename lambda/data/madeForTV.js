    "review":"Fifteen-year-old Kayla has trouble in school.  She is failing all her classes, and a group of boys chase, bully, and attack her daily.  Kayla pulled a school fire alarm to escape them, and the police sent her home.  A school counselor brings Kayla's parents into the principal's office for a meeting.  He suggests putting Kayla in a residential behavior health center, Appaloosa Mountain Girls Academy.  Kayla wakes up late for school the next day.  Instead of finding angry parents, she finds her bags packed with 2 hours to leave for the airport.<br/><br/>Seventeen-year-old Amanda hikes through the mountains with the Alaska Wilderness Girls Academy as part of her treatment.  She pretends to go to the bathroom and escapes.  They find her, strap her to a bed, and give her an ultimatum.  With this being her 3rd center, only one place will take her: Appaloosa.  The nurse tells Amanda that Amanda doesn't belong there.  But if she can keep her head down, Amanda can walk out when she turns 18 in 10 months.<br/><br/>Staff picks up Amanda and Kayla at the airport.  Amanda can see Kayla's excitement and knows Kayla is a newcomer.  She tells Kayla that this is hell and never let them see you cry.  It doesn't take long for the Dean, Ms. Connie, to show Amanda and Kayla her sadistic nature.  Amanda tells Kayla to find a reason to push through.  If not, the center will destroy your spirit.  However, Ms. Connie wants their unwavering obedience and she will risk their lives to get it.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this movie will turn your stomach.  Don't misunderstand that statement.  The acting, writing, and set designs are astonishing.  However, it's the abuse that's painful to watch.  They practice torture and cult techniques to break down the girls' individuality and turn them against each other.  In the end, you discover that these centers are grossly unregulated and use unproven treatments.  Prepare yourself if you have triggers.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lizbeth leaves her job at the women's shelter to pick up her daughters, and her stomach drops when her ex-husband, Greg, approaches.  Greg tells her that their custody agreement will end in 19 hours.  Now, his visits will be unsupervised.<br/><br/>The next day, Greg picks up their girls for 48 hours.  On their first night away, Lizbeth tries to call her children.  But no one answers.  When she attempts a pick-up at their school, the teacher says she hasn't seen the girls in days.  Lizbeth calls the police, and they confirm her worst fears.  Greg took their children.  After getting through Greg's shield of denial, Lizbeth proves Greg took their daughters on a one-way trip to Greece, and he doesn't plan on coming back.  She thinks the Hague Convention will be enough.  Over the next two years, Lizbeth will fight a country and Greg for her children and freedom.<br/><br/>There aren't enough glasses of wine to get you through this movie without being moved to tears.  Based on Pieces of Me: Rescuing My Kidnapped Daughters by Lizbeth Meredith, this film covers two years of emotional turmoil for Lizbeth and her two daughters.  In a system plagued with corruption, Lizbeth fights a losing battle.  But Lizbeth's biggest struggle is her daughter's mental state.  Each setback will break your heart and make you yell at the TV.  Don't let the year fool you.  While this happened between 1994 and 1996, it still happens today, and getting children back can be just as complex.  This film is an excellent production with detailed clothing, technology, and laws.  It will be a heartfelt favorite.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
