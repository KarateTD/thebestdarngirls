    "review":"Howie allows Kevin Garnett to borrow a precious, uncut black opal with his championship ring as collateral. He tells Kevin he needs the opal back in time for the auction. Howie takes Garnett's ring and pawns it for gambling money. He hopes the bet will cover his losses, payback bookies, and get Kevin's ring back, so he can get the opal. Once at auction, Howie believes the Opal will fetch $1,000,000. However, someone stopped his bet. Now, he must stay one step ahead while everyone is on his tail.<br/><br/>This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. You have no idea which way is up the entire time of the movie. There are no good guys or bad guys in the movie, only hustlers. Each time Howie is one step ahead, he gets knocked backward. Get ready for one huge roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

The betrayal, encouragement, and love within their sisterly bond will bring them closer together as they lose their sister.<br/><br/>This plotline is not given linearly. It moves between now and the past within the blink of an eye. So you have to pay attention to the subtle changes in the women’s appearances. Each actress brings everything to her role and leaves you in awe. This movie will make you curious to read the book and see how it differs from the movie. While it is a good watch, you won’t have an urge to buy it. One viewing is enough to appreciate its artistry.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 2018, the world at Fox News was not ready for the storm looming behind the hills. On-air talent Gretchen Carlson was meeting with her lawyers to create an argument for her harassment claim. She has found a way to sue Roger Ailes and not Fox News. When Gretchen comes forward, dozens will follow. Including Megyn Kelly. When everyone has to take sides, who can be trusted and who will be left standing?<br/><br/>Based on a true scandal, this movie should be seen as an outline of the events, not gospel. Their views on what happened and why can be derived from their real-life interviews. These women went from reporting the news to being a part of the story. The Fox News scandal will be a case study for years to come.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Each cat performs for Old Deuteronomy and she picks someone to go to the Heaviside Layer for a new life. As talented cats start to disappear, who will win the Jellicle Ball?<br/><br/>Based on the stage musical Cats which derived from Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the graphic and motion capture teams have done A+ work creating this film. Each cats’ essences, even down to the movement of their tails and their ears was perfectly in sync. The plot starts to slow down and the songs were not distinctive enough. The movie is fun for the whole family but only if you know the original play. Others will be lost in the plot.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
