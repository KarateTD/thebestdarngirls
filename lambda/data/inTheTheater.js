    "review": "Over the years, Riley became an excellent student, strong hockey player, animal lover, and caring friend. Her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - continue to share her core memories and store them in long-term storage. The vital memories form her beliefs. Each belief creates Riley's belief system and her sense of self, the newest section of her mind. Joy will do anything to protect the latest system.<br/><br/>Riley celebrates with her best friends Grace and Bree as the coach of the Fire Hawks, Coach Roberts, approaches them after winning a game. She wants them to come to her hockey camp to train. Her favorite player, Val, is on the team. Val started her first year and is a legend among high school players. Grace, Bree, and Riley accept the invitation.<br/><br/>Riley goes to bed the night before camp and dreams of meeting Val and practicing with her friends. As Riley turns in for the night, her emotions do the same. A beeping awakes Joy in the middle of the night. She and the other emotions walk over to the console and see the puberty light gently flashing. Then, it blares. The demo team rips out the console and updates it for the new guys, but Riley wakes up before they finish.<br/><br/>Riley's mother, Mrs. Andersen, enters Riley's room and expresses her surprise that Riley isn't ready for camp. Her emotions touch the console, and Riley cries, yells, and collapses in bed. They find a new emotion touching it. Anxiety introduces Riley's emotions to Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment.<br/><br/>The Andersens give Riley and her friends a ride to camp. Riley talks about their future together when Disgust notices a look on Bree's face. Grace feels the tension and blurts out that she and Bree will attend a different high school. Riley maintains her composure until her parents drive away. Val notices Riley's sadness, talks to her, and invites Riley to sit with her team. Anxiety takes over and defuses the situation by predicting possible outcomes and changes Riley's personality to give Riley the best conclusion. Joy tries to help, but her attempts make Riley look silly. Anxiety tells Embarrassment to grab Riley's old emotions after Joy makes another mistake. Anxiety tells the mind police to take them to Riley's Dark Secrets Vault. Then, Anxiety disconnects Riley's Sense of Self and sends it to the back of Riley's mind. They will use her new memories with second-generation emotions to build a new Riley. Can Riley's first-generation emotions return to Riley's mind before Anxiety takes over?<br/><br/>Riley and her emotions did it again. They cause the audience to laugh, cringe, cry, and breathe a sigh of relief. The writers added new sections of Riley's mind while taking fans through familiar territory. Riley breaks the rules, disregards her friends, and forces herself to practice when her other emotions are at the helm. Riley loses her Sense of Self for popularity. The movie explains how Anxiety works, helps, and harms people in a lovingly gentle way. The conclusion profoundly affects adults and teaches kids the value of emotions. You should see this movie in theaters today.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Bad Boys: Ride or Die",
    "review": "Marcus delivers a toast at a moment he thought would never happen: Mike's wedding. Marcus cries as he wishes Mike the best with his new bride, Christine. Marcus gets help from Captain Conrad's daughter, U.S. Marshall Judy, and granddaughter, Callie. Marcus dances the Wobble and suffers a heart attack. Captain Conrad assures Marcus that he won't die and gives Marcus a warning. Marcus wakes up with a new lease on life and is 100% fearless. As Marcus begs Mike to get him Skittles, Mike gets a news alert on his phone. The FBI found evidence that Captain Conrad was working with the drug cartels.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus run to headquarters to clear their captain's legacy, but Captain Rita and her boyfriend, Attorney General Lockwood, must follow the evidence. Judy enters and demands they find the real culprits. Mike offers to help, but she refuses because Mike's son, Armando, killed her dad.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus ride and contemplate their next steps when they get a video message from Conrad. He was looking into corruption after their ecstasy bust years ago. Now, he needs his Bad Boys to clear his name. He warns them to trust no one. Mike believes they must ask a cartel member to catch the corruption.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus visit Armando in prison. Armando states that Conrad was clean. Also, his mother, Isabel, didn't put Conrad on the list; someone added him. Mike and Marcus find Conrad's secret case files and pull Armando out of jail to go through them. They believe they have an advantage, but the culprit is one step ahead. To get through this, Mike and Marcus will need fate, AMMO, Reggie, and alligators.<br/><br/>For newcomers to the franchise, it helps to see the three previous films before watching this 4th installment. This chapter of the buddy-action-comedy will introduce a new version of Bad Boys, tie up loose ends, and show you another side of Reggie. Unlike the previous films, Mike is cautious and has panic attacks. However, Marcus is fearless and wild. Their switch, along with the action-packed fight scenes, make this movie entertaining. Be prepared to laugh, wince, and cheer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Summer Camp",
    "review": "Nora arrived at Camp Pinnacle because her parents wanted her to make friends. Nora hears Jane begging Mary to get out of the bathroom. Ginny barges into the bathroom and discovers Mary started her period. Ginny talks Mary through it and pulls Mary out. Later, Ginny sees Nora struggling at archery and assists. The counselors put Nora, Mary, and Ginny in a cabin together. The three remained friends.<br/><br/>It's their Camp reunion, and Ginny, a bestselling author, is excited to attend but worries her friends won't make it. Mary wanted to become a doctor. But she left school to become a wife and mother. She became an E.R. nurse later, but Ginny thinks Mary settled for her husband. Nora excelled in school and obtained multiple degrees. She dove deeper into work after her husband died. Ginny believes this reunion is what their friendship needs. It's so much more.<br/><br/>Each of these women stands their ground and finds their voice. Nora delves into work because it's safe but never ventures out for more. Nora learns her wants in marriage and friendship. Ginny assumes she has all the answers, but only because she doesn't let anyone else speak. After they grow and admit their faults, they ask one question: Am I The A. Hole. While the movie had the fun and raunchiness of camp, the bloopers were funnier than the film. The start and conclusion were entertaining, but the middle dragged. If this plot isn't for you, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga",
    "review": "Furiosa plucks fruit with her sister, Valkyrie, when she sees scavengers in their woods. Furiosa's home is an oasis, The Green Place, in the wastelands, and she has to protect it. One of the scavengers captures and kidnaps Furiosa. Valkyrie warns their mother, Mary. Mary finds Furiosa but gets captured by Dementus, the biker leader. Dementus sees Furiosa is in good health and demands to know her origin. Both refuse to talk. So Dementus makes Furiosa watch as he kills her mother.<br/><br/>Dementus sees his men are starving and orders Immortan Joe, ruler of the Citadel, to give his people more food and water. When Joe doesn't listen, Dementus captures the ruler of Gastown and brings him to the Citadel. Joe gives in to some of Dementus's requests and makes Dementus the new ruler of Gastown. However, Joe wants Furiosa as a future wife because she has never been sick. Furiosa must escape Joe, get revenge for Mary, and return to The Green Place.<br/><br/>This prequel has the action you expect from the Mad Max series while answering fanatics' questions about Furiosa. This installment tells you who kidnapped her, what happened to her arm, the start of her face paint, and how she developed into a War Rig commander and Imperator. Also, this movie, unlike its predecessor, is told in four parts - The Pole Inaccessibility, Lessons from the Wasteland, The Stowaway, and Homeward. And the director brilliantly connected the two movies for die-hard fans in the last scene. When there isn't an explosion to rely on, the dialogue and storytelling dulls.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Garfield Movie",
    "review": "Garfield waits for his father, Vic, to return but can't ignore his stomach after hours alone. Lonely, Jon looks out the window and sees Garfield's sad eyes. Jon opens the window and gives Garfield a few slices of pepperoni. Garfield decides to go with Jon because Vic never returned. Jon takes Garfield home and later adopts Odie.<br/><br/>Today, Garfield and Odie enjoy the good life, excluding Mondays. Garfield wakes up for his midnight snack and opens the fridge. Someone kidnaps Odie and Garfield before Odie cooks.<br/><br/>The kidnappers, Noland and Roland, hang Odie and Garfield by their feet and leave them there. Then, a masked cat cuts them down. Garfield recognizes the cat as Vic, his father. Garfield doesn't want to exit with Vic because Vic abandoned him in the alley. Jinx appears from the darkness and scares everyone. She ordered Roland and Noland to take Garfield and Odie to lure Vic out of hiding. When the city pound caught Jinx, Vic left her behind. Now, she wants Vic to steal a quart of milk - for each day she was in the pound. It will be a lot of milk because Jinx was in prison for over four years. She tells Vic to take Garfield and Odie with him to help. Can this heist repair this broken bond?<br/><br/>This movie has good intentions but doesn't spark laughter. It had physical, slapstick humor for kids. And it slipped in adult, non-sexual jokes. The plot's saving grace is explaining a father's love and sacrifice to the audience. Garfield feels abandoned, but he is never alone. However, that message loses its luster with the multiple product placements.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
