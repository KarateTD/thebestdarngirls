    "review":"A dozen people wake up in a field with bits in their mouths and locks on the bits’ buckle.  They have no idea where they are or how they got there.  They find a crate in the middle of the field with a crowbar by its side.  Only one man grabs the crowbar and opens it.  The man opens the crate and a pig wearing a shirt comes out.  The man pulls a rack filled with weapons.   As people come to grab a weapon, a young girl finds a key.  The key unlocks the bits.  They gather weapons and start to talk when shots ring through the air.  Only half make it out the field and into the woods.  The six don’t know they are part of a hunt.  Liberal elites have chosen them to travel to the manor and be hunted.  They made one mistake: Underestimating Crystal.<br/><br/>Based on The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell, this movie takes a swipe at everyone.  The Hunt is The Hunger Games and Kill Bill all combined into one political satire and mystery.  This movie shows the ugliness and prejudice in everyone.  Whether we like it or not.  If you have a weak stomach, there will be too much gore for you.  Who is the real snowball?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ray wakes up with no memory of his past and Dr. Emil by his bedside.  His body was donated by the military to Rising Spirit Technologies, or R.S.T., because his family didn’t claim his body.  Ray is R.S.T’s first fully revived candidate.  Ray feels normal but Dr. Emil cuts his hand and puts it under a microscope.  Ray can see nanites repairing his cut before it has a chance to bleed.  Now, Ray is superhuman.  KT sees Ray is having a hard time adjusting so she offers to help Ray remember which alcohol he likes.  As they take shots, Psycho Killer is played over the speaker.  It jogs an agonizing memory.  Before Ray died, Martin Axe drugged him and kidnapped his wife, Gina.  Martin wanted to know how Ray knew about the hostage situation in Mombasa.  Ray explains that he was following orders and never knew who leaked the information.  Martin believes Ray but kills Gina with a bolt gun anyway.  Ray tells Martin that Martin better kill him or Ray will end his life.  Martin takes Ray on his suggestion and kills Ray.  Ray doesn’t know the killer was planted in his head.  Dr. Emil is using Ray to eliminate former RST employees that are a threat to his business.  When Ray discovers the truth, he will need to gain control of his new augmented body and bring down his creator.<br/><br/>Based on the Bloodshot comics, this movie doesn’t hold a candle to the comic.  The plot is a mix of Deadpool and Frankenstein but it still doesn’t excite you.  The graphics are cartoonish, the action mundane, and the plot overdone.  Thank goodness for the comic relief Wilfred.  This lovable computer genius is the wingman or ‘guy in the chair’ every superhero needs.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"With a brand new guitar, Jeremy Camp leaves home for Calvary Chapel Bible College.  After some time on campus, he sneaks backstage to hear and get tips from musician Jean-Luc.  Not only did Jean-Luc give Jeremy tips, but he also let Jeremy tune his guitar.  As Jeremy switches out the guitar, he sees a beautiful girl in the crowd.  After the concert, he introduces himself to Melissa.  The next day, she sees him play guitar under a tree.  She invites him to a bonfire and tells him to bring his guitar.  At the bonfire, Jeremy is surprised to see Jean-Luc there with Melissa.  She explains her relationship with Jean-Luc is complicated.  Jean-Luc wants more from their friendship but she doesn't.  Unknown to Jean-Luc, Jeremy and Melissa start to date.  The couple breaks up after a few months because Jeremy is tired of being a secret.  During winter break, Jeremy gets a phone call from Jean-Luc.  Melissa was taken to the hospital and it’s bad.  Melissa tells Jeremy she has stage C3 cancer.  They removed a cancerous growth, the size of an orange, from her stomach and she will start chemotherapy soon.  To keep the love of his life, Jeremy asks Melissa to marry him.   He is inspired to write songs for and ask fans to pray for his wife.  With those decisions, Jeremy will find the miracle before the supernova.<br/><br/>Based on I Still Believe by Jeremy Camp, this movie is a moving tribute to Melissa and the legacy she wanted to leave behind.  She wanted Jeremy to use her story to make people believe in faith and hope, not lose it during hard times.  It may not have the same outcome as Breakthrough, it does give you a powerful love story within a deeper love story.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jack Cunningham drinks to wake up, in the shower, on the job, and a case to go to sleep at night.  Jack checks his messages and gets one from his old high school principal.  The principal wants him to coach the new boys' basketball team for Bishop Hayes High School.  The team hasn't had a good year since Jack played in 1995. The principal tells Jack to go home, think about it, and give him an answer in the morning.  Jack practices turning down the principal while drinking a case of beer.  With all his practice, Jack shows up the next morning. Jack sits on the sidelines and watches the boys play.  Jack can't fathom having so few players on the team.  They have to borrow players from the J.V. team just to practice.  Jack sees their best shooter can't make a 3-pointer and the best guy on the team doesn't talk. Their way back to the playoffs is his way back to life.  When his past comes back to haunt him, will the old Jack resurface?<br/><br/>This feels like an episode of Intervention without the confessionals.  You don't have a true understanding of how bad Jack's drinking is until he drinks a case of beer in a few hours.  There is a moment of parallel in the storyline. Marcus is begging to stay on the team after Jack kicks him off for being late and disobedient.  By the end of the film, Jack's drinking leads him to a car crash, breaking and entering, and missed practices.  He has to beg to coach the team like Marcus.  Seeing him beg for a second chance to fix his life will rock you to the core.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Emma.",
    "review":"Emma Woodhouse is a 21-year-old woman with no plans to marry.  She is described as handsome, clever, and rich.  She believes women only marry for money, employment, or consequence.  In her 21 years, she has never been distressed or vexed.  However, Emma loves playing matchmaker. When her friend, Harriet comes to visit, she comes with good news.  She met a suitor named Mr. Martin.  Mr. Martin wants to marry Harriet but Emma tells her he isn't good enough.  She must find a man that is above her station.  So Harriet refuses his proposal.  Emma believes Mr. Elton is better suited for Harriet and makes arrangements for them to meet. While Emma thinks she is doing Harriet a service, Mr. Knightley counters her.  He thinks Emma is spoiled, vain, and selfish. Also, he hates seeing Emma wait for Mr. Churchill to return her affection. Mr. Knightley believes Mr. Churchill is stringing Emma along.  Emma continues to wait but she will be challenged when Harriet has eyes for another man ... Mr. Knightley.  If that isn't enough, Mr. Churchill pops in for a surprise visit.  Then her unknowing rival Jane Fairfax is coming to visit.  Leaving Emma in the middle of two men with Harriet and Jane Fairfax standing in her way.<br/><br/>Based on Emma by Jane Austen, this latest adaptation is funny and accurate in the clothing, set design, and manners.  While you won't be doubled over in laughter, you will find a quick chuckle with side-eye glances, polite looks of disgust, and subtle verbal jabs with extreme etiquette. This is a good matinee movie if you like period pieces or Jane Austen. Everyone else should wait for Vudu.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
