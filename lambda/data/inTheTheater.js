    "review": "Pharmaceutical Representative Martin Kerbs sits in traffic while police try to move a dying dinosaur off the road. Since the escape of dinosaurs, most have died due to the current climate and disease. The remaining live near the equator because it resembles their natural habitat. He jumps when he hears Covert Ops Specialist Zora Bennett in the back of his car. She knows Martin is looking for her and wants to know why. He must collect DNA from three distinct dinosaurs to create life-saving heart medication. It's illegal for anyone to travel near the equator. So, this mission is top secret. Zora walks away until Martin offers $10 million. But he must recruit one more person.<br/><br/>Martin and Zora enter the museum while paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis helps box the exhibits. Martin tells Henry his plan, and Henry summarizes that they need Centurian dinosaurs. They need samples from aquatic Mosasaurus, terrestrial Titanosaurus, and avian Quetzalcoatlus. Henry mulls it over, but Zora appeals to his deepest desire: seeing the animals he admires in the wild.<br/><br/>Martin, Zora, and Henry travel to a small island near the equator. Zora sits with Duncan and runs a con on Martin. They get Martin to double his payment so Duncan and his crew can take them to the equator. They set sail from Ile Saint-Hubert to find the creatures. Before they get there, they hear a mayday on the radio. Reuben set sail with his two daughters, Isabella and Teresa, and Teresa's boyfriend, Xavier. A Mosasaurus capsized their vessel, and it's sinking. They save the family and bring them aboard the ship. They believe they are safe until the Mosasaurus attacks them. After a deadly battle, Teresa falls off the vessel while they collect the first sample. Her family and Xavier jump off to save her while Duncan and the remaining team shipwreck on Ile Saint-Hubert. Can both groups survive the island and collect the final two samples?<br/><br/>This film, like the first, lets the viewer's imagination scare them first. Similar to the latest movies, this picture offers new genetically altered dinosaurs. However, the main plot sticks to the classic creatures we love. This script has witty banter, jump scares, and heartfelt moments. The script gets murky with Reuben and his family. It only needs one family member for one critical scene. Otherwise, their subplot is a 30-minute filler. This new installment in the franchise subtly mentions the past films but doesn't rely on them. It's an improvement over the past, but nothing beats the first.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sonny finishes his race, collects his meager winnings, and leaves to find the next challenge. He hears a voice behind him and sees a familiar face, Ruben. Ruben and Sonny competed in the past, but now Ruben owns a racing team, APEX GP. However, APEX GP has yet to win a race. If APEX GP doesn't win, the board will remove Ruben. Ruben's best driver, Joshua, is highly skilled but young. Ruben wants Sonny to join his team and bring maturity to it. Ruben believes that Joshua and Sonny could win F1 and bring credibility to APEX GP. So Ruben leaves him a first-class ticket to their training track.<br/><br/>Joshua tries out their new car but notices some issues. Sonny arrives as Joshua reports his findings. Joshua's manager, Cash, pulls him aside. Joshua needs to make a good impression over the next few races. Cash believes APEX GP is going down. If Joshua ranks on the leaderboard, another team could open up a spot for him. Sonny thinks the team can win, but they must make changes to the car. Ruben agrees. While Sonny races to overcome his past, Joshua wants to keep his career. Can APEX GP survive with two men competing for the number one spot?<br/><br/>This film has the high-octane fun of Days of Thunder with witty banter. It pays respect to the intricacies and dangers of racing. The audience sees the split decisions, track sabotage, and teamwork in racing. The film uses F1 drivers and scenarios to increase the drama and urgency. The viewer will feel it in their chest as they get a cockpit view of the track. However, this film isn't solely about the race. It also covers espionage and sabotage, but the writers make the audience connect the clues of who is responsible. While the film is lengthy, it delivers an original competitive racing story.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "M3GAN 2.0",
    "review": "Gemma crusades to reduce children's exposure to technology and AI safeguards after creating a killer robot to help raise her niece, Cady. Gemma hasn't turned her back on technology. She and her team have created an exoskeleton to reduce workplace injuries and increase productivity.<br/><br/>Gemma rushes home after picking Cady up from school. She's late for an investor's meeting. The exoskeleton glitched and hit the investor. Someone hacked them. Then, CEO Alton enters Gemma's home and propositions her. He wants Gemma to work for him and add AI to the human brain. Gemma says no.<br/><br/>Gemma tucks Cady into bed and relaxes for the evening. The lights flicker, and a strange message comes to the TV, telling her to run. Gemma and Cady fight back until one man pulls out a badge. He's with the FBI.<br/><br/>Army Colonel Tim demands answers from Gemma. A few days ago, Tim sent a robot called AMELIA, Autonomous Military Engagement Logistics and Infiltration Android, to rescue a scientist. However, AMELIA killed him, removed her safeguards, and escaped. Since then, AMELIA has killed everyone who had a hand in her creation. He informs Gemma that her M3GAN program was the foundation for AMELIA. He assumes she created the robot and demands an explanation. During the conversation, Gemma checks her phone's notifications. It warns her that Tim is clueless and to ignore his threats. Tim leaves with her phone. She calls out to M3GAN, who appears as a hologram. M3GAN lived in the smart home's system for years, watching them. By M3GAN's calculations, any attempts to stop AMELIA will result in Cady's end. M3GAN wants to protect Cady by stopping AMELIA. But first, she needs Gemma to create a body for her. Gemma will do the one thing she swore she never would: create a better M3GAN. Can they put an end to AMELIA?<br/><br/>This sequel is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The script is funnier, cringier, and more thought-provoking than the first. It allows the audience to think about AI without getting preachy. The graphics department allowed M3GAN to keep her doll-like face while turning her body into the ultimate killing machine. This film is a laugh riot that delivers a few jump scares and a side of Maxwell you have never heard before.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Elio",
    "review": "Elio hides under the table, mourning the lost of his parents, as his aunt Olga orders food from the Montez Air and Space Museum cafeteria. Olga looks under the table, and Elio is gone. She searches the museum and finds Elio listening to a presentation about the Golden Record. He ponders if there are others out there. It will be a place he could finally fit in.<br/><br/>Elio stakes out places near the Montez Air Force Base to be abducted. One night, Bryce joins Elio on the beach with his hand radio. Bryce asks about the other club members when Bryce's friend, Caleb, joins them. Elio hears a strange signal coming from the radio, and Caleb pulls the radio from Elio's hands, and they fight. The device hits Elio in the eye, and all three boys return to the base.<br/><br/>Major Olga is furious because Elio skipped school and got into a physical altercation. She tells Elio to wait in her office so she can attend a short meeting. A contractor, Gunther Melmac, picked up a signal from outer space. It's the same sound Elio heard from his radio. Melmac believes it's aliens and is ready to send a signal back. Everyone leaves. Elio jumps out of the trash, records a message for aliens to abduct him, and sends it. It shuts down the base.<br/><br/>At her wits' end, Olga takes Elio to a summer academy to curb his behavior. Caleb and Bryce spot Elio's arrival, and Caleb plots his revenge. Caleb, Bryce, and two other boys pull Elio out of his tent. Elio opens his eyes and sees the world around him frozen. He wiggles out of the boys' clutches, and a green beam lifts him off the ground. Elio cheers as he floats to the ship.<br/><br/>Ooooo, a liquid supercomputer, greets Elio and introduces him to the leaders of the Communiverse. Ambassadors Questa, Helix, and Tegmen greet Elio, assuming he's the leader of Earth. They are willing to accept him as a member of the Communiverse but squirm over their second visitor, Lord Grigon. The won't welcome him. Grigon threatens to make them all pay before leaving. They prepare for a fearful retreat and inform Elio that he must return to Earth. Elio can't bear the thought of being alone again and offers a trade. He will broker a deal with Grigon. They agree to let Elio stay if he persuades Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. Will Elio save the Communiverse and find a place where he belongs?<br/><br/>This Pixar film covers acceptance and belonging while honoring a parent's sacrifice and understanding. Emotions aside, this film is visually splendid. The animators didn't use alien stereotypes. They created something new and unique. It's easy to see how this movie can grow and expand into a series on the Disney Channel. While the story will not make you cry, it does connect to the audience. There aren't any sly adult jokes, but this picture is funny. This film is confusing because it lacks a classic villain, leaving the plot more complex. Young viewers will enjoy it, but won't comprehend the message. Overall, Elio is an entertaining but elaborate film for the entire family. It has stellar visuals and a mid-credit scene.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Matchmaker Lucy meets with clients before returning to work and celebrating her 9th engagement. A day later, Lucy attends her clients' wedding. She mingles with the guests before the nuptials and collects business cards. She doesn't see the groom's brother, Harry, eavesdropping on her clever pitch to the single attendees.<br/><br/>After the wedding, Harry moves the place cards to sit next to Lucy. They discuss her job, love, and what people want. She offers to help him, but he wants her. Harry offers to get her a drink, and Lucy requests a Coke and a beer. Before Harry stands, a waiter, John, sets both drinks on the table. Lucy gawks at her ex-boyfriend before he retreats. Later, Lucy finds John at the loading docks, and they discuss the past. He offers her a ride, and she accepts before returning to the reception. Harry asks Lucy to dance with him, and she obliges. As they sway on the dancefloor, John looks on with regret. Harry is a handsome, wealthy man willing to use his resources to woo Lucy. Lucy will have to choose between John and Harry, but she believes she isn't good enough for either of them. Who will she choose?<br/><br/>This film settles into the dark corners of dating. It doesn't try to make one gender look better than the other. The movie forces the audience to reflect on themselves. It forces Lucy to look beyond the checklist and see her clients as more than math problems. Like 'Sex in the City', Materialists use New York as its backdrop. The sounds of the city become the backing track to the chaos. This picture leans more towards romance than comedy, so it's missing something you can't put your finger on. It's up to the viewer to decide if Lucy made the right choice.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
