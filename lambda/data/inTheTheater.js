    "review": "Venom makes Eddie a drink while the news plays in the background. The police issued a warrant for Eddie's arrest. They believed he murdered Patrick Mulligan. Eddie must leave town now. Before they go to New York, Venom needs a snack. They find dog fighters for Venom to munch. They don't see human and alien surveillance following them.<br/><br/>Doctor Teddy Payne gets a text message from General Rex Strickland stating they are bringing the subject to Area 51. She races to the military facility. Teddy looks Patrick in the eye and calls the alien inside him. Toxin warns Teddy and Rex that Knull is coming to kill everything on the planet, and the black one is the key. Rex sends the Air Force to find Eddie and Venom.<br/><br/>Venom and Eddie hitch a plane to New York. Venom envelops Eddie's body to comfort Eddie. Then, a Xenophage jumps on the plane and attacks. The Xenophage is looking for the Codex. When a symbiote returns its host from the dead, it and the host become one life force. That life force creates a key called the Codex. Knull sent the Xenophage to find the Codex. Knull created the symbiotes and Xenophages. However, Knull became evil, and the symbiotes imprisoned Knull with the Xenophages. The Codex is the only thing that can free Knull. The only way to destroy the Codex is if one of them dies.<br/><br/>Eddie and Venom travel the Nevada desert until Rex finds them and starts shooting. Venom takes form and attracts the Xenophage. Eddie and Venom escape together, but Eddie has innocent blood on his hands. Eddie and Venom must escape the San Francisco police, the Air Force, and Knull's Xenophage without one of them dying.<br/><br/>he final installment of the Venom series combines the first and second plots. The writers make several jokes, but you won't laugh out loud. The graphics flow and don't distract the viewer from the story. And the audience can feel the struggle and bond between Eddie and Venom. There is a mid-credit scene to expand this multiverse's MCU, but the post-credit scene answers a question no one asked. This film is a fitting end to the series, but it's equally good as the others.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Pharrell Williams welcomes a documentary crew into his home. But before he answers questions, he thinks the story should be in Lego. He doesn't feel that anything is new. We take what exists, break it apart, and create something different, just like the classic toy. Then, Pharrell talks about his early connection with music, especially Stevie Wonder. He bonded with the music because Pharrell has synesthesia. He sees and hears the music around him. His grandmother saw his potential. She told him God had a higher purpose for him, bought him a snare drum, and instructed him to join the band. He met Chad, Shay, Pusha T, Missy Elliott, and Timbaland. Pharrell's life will touch the world.<br/><br/>Pharrell was correct. His story could only be in Lego. You see the world through his creative lens. The film doesn't feel like a typical Behind The Music documentary. Each song is a different Lego structure that lights up and bounces when he shows it to others. In case you are wondering, it never changes perspective. The audience stays in the Lego world. Viewers will learn something new about the legendary producer while singing along to his greatest hits. He wants creativity to be celebrated and never boxed in. Parents should know there is some light swearing, but it doesn't dominate the film. Also, some classic music videos get the Lego treatment. This movie is a pure classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Saturday Night",
    "review": "It's October 11th, 1975, and an NBC Page hands flyers to attract an audience for the taping of a new show, Saturday Night. Producer Lorne Michaels smokes a cigarette outside and politely converses when he sees a flaming page drop from the sky. He walks into the building, and Dick Ebersol questions why Lorne requested llamas for the show. Then, Lorne's ex-wife, Rosie, warns Lorne that Jim Belushi hasn't signed his contract. Chevy Chase enters with his girlfriend, Jacqueline, and refuses to work with Belushi. Jim Henson hasn't got a script from the writers and feels they don't respect his muppets. Garrett Morris, a trained actor, wonders why Lorne hired him for the show while Andy Kaufman wanders around the set aimlessly. The host, George Carlin, hates the script and refuses to perform. So, David Tebet brings Milton Berle as a back-up host. The head writer, Michael O'Donoghue, clashes with NBC censor Joan Carbunkle. Lorne must cut down the program, get Belushi to sign, get the actors to stop fighting, ease Joan, and convince George to host before the show starts in 90 minutes. If David doesn't think the show is ready for a live performance, he will cut to a taped version of The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. Lorne's future rides on this one show. Can he get it together?<br/><br/>Amazingly, this show hit the air. Lorne had a keen eye for talent in front of and behind the camera. He discovered the best comedians and writers but didn't understand their personal and professional struggles. Also, no one understood the point of the show. Lorne's world is on fire as he learns NBC doesn't have faith in him. While the actors are hilarious, the behind-the-scenes antics are fun but not funny. This film is perfect for the matinee price but not for the kids.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Joker: Folie Ã  Deux",
    "review": "The guards at Arkham Asylum give Arthur Fleck a clean shave and suit before he meets his lawyer, Maryanne Stewart. Maryanne prepares Arthur for a conference with his court-appointed psychologist. The psychologists believes Arthur has a split personality that he calls Joker after suffering years of abuse. If they can get the court to accept it, Arthur will spend his life in a mental facility instead of a prison for murdering five people. The guards lead Arthur to B-ward, and he hears singing. Arthur peeks inside and glances at a beautiful woman with an angelic voice. Arthur finishes his psychiatric evaluation, but Maryanne knows this strategy is a long shot. Arthur goes back to his cell. During yard time, a guard, Jackie, got Arthur some time in the B-ward's music class. Arthur can't contain his excitement.<br/><br/>Arthur sits next to the woman. She tells him her name is Lee. He inspired her. She grew up in the same building as him and had an abusive father. She watched Arthur on The Murray Franklin Show and wanted Arthur to shoot him. Then, he did. That's when Lee felt seen for the first time. The guards pull Arthur away, but he is smitten with Lee.<br/><br/>Arthur watches District Attorney Harvey Dent give a press conference about Arthur's trial. Judge Herman Rothwax deemed Arthur fit to stand trial. And Harvey wants Arthur to get the death penalty.<br/><br/>B-ward's music class watches a musical. Lee gets up, walks to the piano, sets it ablaze, and sits in her seat. When people spot the fire, they run. Lee grabs Arthur, and they flee in the other direction. The guards grab Arthur and throw him into the hole until his trial.<br/><br/>One day, Lee awakens Arthur. She bribed a guard to let her into the hole to say goodbye to Arthur. However, she plans to be at Arthur's trial daily. She paints Arthur's face, and they make love in the hole.<br/><br/>Arthur enters the courtroom but looks back at the door during the opening statement. He beams with glee when Lee enters and sits in the back. After the first day of deliberations, Lee confronts Maryanne in the vestibule. Lee thinks Maryanne is mocking the Joker and losing the trial. Lee says the world is on Joker's side and will free him.<br/><br/>Lee goes to the holding cell and tells Joker that Maryanne will lose the trial. Maryanne meets with Arthur about the trial. He professes his love for Lee, and Maryanne laughs. She reveals that Lee is a liar. Her name is Harley Quinzel, and her parents are rich. Arthur confronts Lee about her lies, and she confesses. She lied because she wanted Joker to like her. She wants him to let Joker free. Arthur takes her advice and fires Maryanne. Joker will represent himself and make the world smile. Will he be found guilty and sent to death?<br/><br/>This musical sequel is an ambitious change from the first film. Arthur and Lee perform songs, together and apart, to express their feelings. However, the movie stays grounded when the real world bleeds into the music and dance. The costume designers ensured the world around Arthur was gloomy and gray. But Joker's world had spots of color. The storyline does an excellent job of recapping the first film. The plot slows down for the songs, and sometimes the music drowns out the actors. However, the film is worthwhile. The audience will watch Arthur Fleck's trial and Joker's birth.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Megalopolis",
    "review": "Architect Cesar Catilina is the chairman of the Design Authority and wants to use his invention, Megalon, to build a city called Megalopolis. Megalon is a bio-adaptive material that he believes is the future. However, Mayor Franklyn Cicero stands in Cesar's way. Cicero and Cesar confront each other during a press event. Cicero's daughter, Julia, watches the face-off from afar. She grows tired of Cesar embarrassing her father. She wants to expose Cesar.<br/><br/>Cesar returns home and asks his mistress, reporter Wow Platinum, to stop watching her interview with Hamilton Crassus the third, owner of Crassus National Bank.

Clodio decides to be a man of the people to gain their trust, become a politician, gain Hamilton's respect, and end Cesar. Can Cesar complete his vision with enemies surrounding him?<br/><br/>This movie brings Rome into the third millennium of America. The characters wear futuristic togas and laurels while celebrating debauchery and virginity. However, this movie is 1 hour too long. It tries too hard to be stunning and provocative but is confusing and disjointed. The cinematography is for the big screen, but the script is for streaming. The actors did a masterful job with what the writer gave them. But they couldn't save this film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
