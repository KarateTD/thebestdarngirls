    "review":"Old Dolio learned the art of the hustle from her parents, Theresa and Robert. They live in a run-down office that leaks suds once a week for $500 a month.  But they missed the last three months rent.  So, Old Dolio comes up with a plan.  They won a trip to New York, so they will fly together but pretend they don't know each other on the way back.  Theresa and Robert will pick up all three bags, and Old Dolio will declare her bag lost.  Since she insured the bag, the airport will send her a check for $1575 if they can't find it. Theresa and Robert change their plan when they meet Melanie on the flight back. Instead of Theresa and Robert picking up three bags, Theresa, Robert, and Melanie get the bags, while Old Dolio files the claim. For Melanie, they are having the Ocean's Eleven adventure she always wanted, but, to Old Dolio, Melanie is a liability.  Then, Melanie comes up with a new plan.  Often, elderly clients ask her to visit their homes.  She plans on complimenting their heirlooms and hopes they will offer it to her.  Next, she will pawn their heirlooms for money. During a heist, Old Dolio discovers the mark wants them to carry-on typical family life until he dies.  Seeing her parents act like real parents with Melanie leaves Old Dolio wanting more from them.  When Old Dolio hears Theresa call Melanie hun, Old Dolio offers Theresa all the insurance money if Theresa can call her hun too.  Theresa can't do it. It's just not them.  Melanie interjects and calls Old Dolio hun.  Melanie offers to do everything Old Dolio's parents didn't do for her if she gives Melanie the money. Old Dolio says yes, but Melanie knows Old Dolio is addicted to them.  And when they come around, Old Dolio will need another fix.  With $1575 on the line, you know they are coming back.<br/><br/>Robert and Theresa are neglectful, abusive, and heartless parents.  It's evident in all of Old Dolio's actions.  She hates to be touched, looked at, or loved by anyone.  In the first 15 minutes, you feel hopeless and sad for Old Dolio, her past, and her future.  This movie will hit a nerve for anyone who has grown up in an emotionally dysfunctional family.  Old Dolio has been a tool for her family's schemes, not their child. If you like an independent movie with a conclusion, see this one matinee.  But don't expect to laugh or cry.  Expect to leave with a better understanding of a loving family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Last Shift",
    "review":"At Oscar's Chicken and Fish in Albion, Michigan, Stanley works the night shift and does it with grace. After 38 years, Stanley is ready to leave and take care of his mother in Florida. Stanley's boss, Jasmine, told him the new employee's name is Javon.  Javon is on probation, the father of one, and doesn't have a direction in life. And he doesn't want to go to jail again, so he needs the job at Oscar's.  If he doesn't keep this job, he will go back to jail for the remainder of his sentence, 10 months.  Stanley's by the books, work at peak performance, and calm demeanor is in stark contrast with Javon's out of the box, minimal effort, and confrontational behavior.  As the two learn from each other and bond over frozen patty pucks, drunkards, and responsibilities, what will it take for them to turn on each other?  Money.<br/><br/>This movie covers a lot of topics in a short amount of time.  Topics like the wealth gap, capitalism, minimum wage, ageism, racism, white privilege, social perception, the probation system, and lying all within this short relationship.  There isn't a winner or a loser in this story, just a sad honesty. It doesn't end with flowers, song and dance, or a true conclusion. That is the hardest part to deal with when you leave the theater.  You want them to air out their feeling and resolve things with compassion or force.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Doug and Liz gather their things to head to Meena's graduation party.  Meena is the daughter of Doug's co-worker Javid, who works with Doug at a software company funded by government contracts.  Liz works for the state department and creates cryptography devices.  After the party, Meena's mother calls Liz, Meena is missing. The next morning, Meena is still gone, so Liz calls the police.  Liz and Doug go to Javid's home and get the shock of their lives; the FBI is searching his house, and they labeled Javid a suspect of terrorism. Inside, Javid has terrorist paraphernalia, recruitment videos, and pictures with grenade launchers. A week later, Doug is invited to a conference to discuss his religious blog. Liz tells Doug not to go because she has a feeling something is wrong about the timing.  But Doug wants to spread his message about religious tolerance, peace, and unity.  Doug lands in Cairo, and the interview is going great.  Until Doug says, \"Jesus is God.\" There is an audible gasp in the Muslim audience, and the show abruptly ends.  Doug rushes back to his hotel, locks the door, and calls Liz.  While on the phone with Liz, Doug hears banging on his door.  Three men burst through the door and kidnap him.  The leader, Ramzi, wants Doug to continue his blog in captivity while denouncing what he said on air. The State Department leaves her dumbfounded because they won't help, but they tell her the kidnappers moved Doug to Iran. So Liz decides to head to Iran to save her husband, but she doesn't know Iran charged Doug of spying for America.<br/><br/>Once the storyline is in motion, the action picks up.  This movie feels like an extended version of 24 with family lives on the line, double agents, and betrayals.  While the action is propelling the story forward, the storyline doesn't fall flat.  It keeps the drama going for Liz and Doug.  Liz works to find Doug while determining who she can and can't trust in Iran.  Doug tries to maintain strength in his faith while being tortured, manipulated, and accused. The storyline and action are both compelling and made for the big screen, however, you won't have an urgency to buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lucy works at an art gallery with her boyfriend, Max.  She helps Max with clients and their boss.  Before introducing Max to gallery party attendees, Lucy's coworker tells her Max's ex-girlfriend is in attendance. She sees them get too close and starts to freak out on stage.  By the end of the speech, Lucy has lost her job and her boyfriend. She jumps into Nick's car and starts explaining her sad story.  Nick tries to explain that he isn't her Uber, but Lucy doesn't listen.  To be nice, Nick takes her home. Inside, Lucy's best friends, Nadine and Amanda, are waiting to comfort her.  After days of moping, Nadine and Amanda suggest Lucy purges herself of her past loves by emptying her room.  Lucy keeps mementos of every past relationship.  From Max, she has a tie. With a garbage bag full of memories, she sees Max walking into a restaurant with his new girlfriend.

    "review":"When Adam was younger, he thought he had a problem with his eyes, then his ears.  He was seeing and hearing things that weren't there.  One day, a girl named Rebecca appeared. Adam describes her as a mix of Dalai Lama and Coachella.  Next, Joaquin appeared.  He is every dirty thought a teenager could have in his mind.  Then, The Bodyguard.  Whenever Adam feels threaten, he shows up to protect him.  Adam hides his delusions until senior year. When Adam tries to leave chemistry class, he knocks hot acid on his friend's arm.  The security guard holds Adam down.  Adam is diagnosed with schizophrenia and expelled from school.  His mother, Beth, with her boyfriend, Paul, try every drug possible, but nothing helps.  They put Adam on a drug trial and enroll him in a private catholic school. During his bathroom break, Maya walks in with another student and talks about their deal. Smitten, Adam wants to know more about her, but she quickly puts him in his place and tells him to keep his mouth shut about her side hustle. So, he asks Maya to help him with math. As the delusions disappear and his grades get better, Adam falls for Maya. He falls so much, Adam shows her his passion: Cooking.  When Adam cooks, he is at peace.  And Adam hopes to go to culinary school someday.  However, he doesn't disclose his diagnosis to her.  When the pills threaten his culinary future, Adam stops taking them.  Can he succeed without the drugs and keep Maya's love while keeping his diagnosis a secret?<br/><br/>Based on Words on Bathroom Walls by Julia Walton, this movie takes a real look at mental illness during the formable teenage years.  Its take on schizophrenia is similar to The Fault in Our Stars take on cancer.  The plot never villainizes Adam or his illness.  Adam states I am not the disease, I have a disease.  And he compares how society treats people with cancer compared to those with schizophrenia. For a better understanding, the movie takes you through the trials and tribulations of the family members during diagnosis and treatment.  Also, the film doesn't make medication the cure-all.  The plot discusses the physical and mental side effects of taking medication.  The ending is heartwarming but honest and realistic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
