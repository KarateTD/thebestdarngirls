    "mtitle":"The Boss Baby: Family Business",
    "review":"Thirty years since their last mission, Ted and Tim Templeton are all grown up.  Ted married Carol and became a stay-at-home dad for his two daughters, Tabitha and Tina.  Tabitha is a second-grader and accepted into the most prestigious elementary school in town, The Acorn Center. Ted is a CEO and doesn't come around much, but he does send lots of lavish gifts for Tim's family.  As Tim puts his girls to bed, Tabitha's new grown-up attitude leaves him feeling abandoned.  She doesn't want a song, hug, or a kiss good night, but she wants to be like her Uncle Ted.  As he leaves Tabitha's room, Tim hears a sound coming from Tina's bedroom and goes in to check it out.  It's Tina's toy phone, and Tim gets the shock of his life.  Tina can talk, and she is in the family business. Tina uses a recording teddy bear to manipulate Tim's voice and calls Ted feigning that Tabitha is injured.  Ted gets on his helicopter to come to his niece's aid.  When Tina gets Ted and Tim alone, she stuffs pacifiers in their mouths and takes them to Baby Corp.. Tina explains that Dr. Irwin Armstrong created a school that destroys children's childhoods.  Tim recognizes Dr. Armstrong because he runs The Acorn Center. She gives them a formula that makes them 30 years younger for 48 hours.  They will need to go to The Acorn Center and plant listening devices in Dr. Armstrong's office. While it sounds easy, Tim and Ted must overcome weird kids, detention, and their estrangement to save the children of the world.<br/><br/>Based on The Boss Baby and The Bossier Baby by Marla Frazee, the same message is inside a different plot.  As siblings get older, they often grow apart.  This change isn't because they stop loving each other. In their childhood states, they find each other, and Tim connects with Tabitha.  He sees that his little girl is growing up and pulling away, but she still needs him.  That moment will rock your core.  While it's not as funny as the first, it's an entertaining movie for the entire family. And you must see it from the beginning to get a recap of all the babies from the first movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Tony Lawrence heard about the upcoming Woodstock festival but realized it was missing key artists.  So, with his hustling skills and connections, he made half promises to managers and the city of Harlem about creating a festival at Mount Morris Park.  But with Maxwell House and Mayor John Lindsay backing him up, Tony Lawrence creates a festival with scores of acts and 300,000 attendees over six weeks. Learning that this cultural festival of jazz, funk, blues, pop, gospel, latin, and pop music would happen, several people came together to film it.  That film sat in a basement for 50 years, until now.  Watch as Questlove talks to spectators, culturalists, artists, and organizers to bring this history out of the darkness and into the light.<br/><br/>1969 was a historic year for all Americans because there were assassinations, political change, and a moon landing.  But there was a culture shift happening in Harlem.  The days of buttoned-up suits disappeared for dashikis and afros, and the music of this time reflected this shift within the small community.  And the Harlem Cultural Festival mirrored it all. Hopefully, with the popularity of this movie, the film's proprietors will release the concert in its entirety.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Zola",
    "review":"Zola works at a restaurant and waits on a petite blonde and her date.  The women openly flirt with each other before Zola goes to the back to put in the order.  Zola turns around to see Stefani, the petite blonde, standing in front of her. After a quick discussion, they remembered they danced at the same strip club.  They exchange numbers and social media accounts.  The next day, Stefani texts Zola about a club in Florida where her roommate made $5,000 in one night. When Zola acquires more about the trip, Stefani gives vague or no answers.  But Stephani convinces Zola to go.  Zola gets in a car with Stefani, Stefani's boyfriend, Derrick, and a driver, whose name Zola won't know for 48 hours. The driver leaves Derrick in the motel and drives the women to the club.  They dance and make good money.  Soon Stefani asks Zola to take a picture with her because they both look cute.  From that point on, Zola tells you to keep an eye on everything Stefani does.  Zola has no idea she has entered a life that she knew existed but never wanted.<br/><br/>Based on Zola Tells All: The Real Story Behind the Greatest Stripper Saga Ever Tweeted by David Kushner, this movie is a warning to listen to your inner voice.  Zola ignored several warning signs on her chase for money.  Soon, she enters into a world of pimps, abuse, and suicide.  And she is dependent on the danger to get her back to safety.  This movie is not for young children, tweens, or teens.  It displays an unadulterated and unfiltered view of nudity, abuse, and adult occupations. It's up to the viewer to determine if you believe Stefani or Zola.  It's hard to believe this world exists, but the tweets back it up.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"F9: The Fast Saga",
    "review":"Dom works on a tractor with his son, Brian, assisting him.  When Dom and Letty see a car driving up, they tell Brian to hide and grab their guns.  Then, they hear a familiar voice, Roman.  Roman, Tej, and Ramsey drop by, but it's not a social call.  They got a distress signal from Mr. Nobody as someone hijacked his plane and took it down. She, Roman, and Tej will visit the site in the morning, but they want Dom and Letty to come with them.  Dom turns them down, but later, Letty decides to go. In the morning, Letty, Ramsey, Tej, and Roman board the plane when they hear an American muscle car in the distance.  Dom changed his mind.  They find the crash site and uncovers a locked box that someone tried to cut open.  Ramsey uses her expertise to unlock the box and finds a hemisphere inside. Soon, Roman is between an armored truck and a landmine, and Dom is face to face with his brother, Jakob. If Jakob wants the hemisphere, then it must be dangerous and valuable.  Ramsey and Tej confirm Dom's suspicions.  If a person finds the other hemisphere and the access key to activate it, they will have override software for any object with a computer chip.  By uploading the software to a satellite, Jakob could take over nuclear arms and start World War 3. Luckily for them, Mr. Nobody left them a clue: Han.<br/><br/>The ninth installment to the Fast and Furious saga continues to push the boundaries of physics while making fun of the craziness.  Roman, Tej, and Ramsey discuss if they could be invincible after surviving a tank, a submarine, and a carrier plane.  While this movie has the antics viewers expect, the movie's focal point is healing the past.  Its opening scene starts with the death of Dom's father, Jack. These emotional moments ground the film back to reality for a few seconds. Stay past the first set of end credits for a peek at Fast 10.  And seeing the first eight movies helps.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway",
    "review":"All the people and the animals gather on the McGregor farm to watch Thomas and Bea marry. The animals have agreed that they can eat anything on the farm, but they can't touch Tom's tomatoes. But Thomas keeps a watchful eye on the rambunctious Peter.  One day, Bea gets a letter from Nigel Basil-Jones, a publisher that wants to distribute her latest book.  So, Bea and Thomas pack up the rabbits and meet with Nigel. Nigel promises to keep the integrity of the book but wants a label for the rabbits.  He labels Peter as the villain. Shocked, Peter walks away and finds Barnabas stealing peaches.  Barnabas recognizes something in Peter, then recollects that he knew Peter's father. The two go on a spree of chaos, and a pet store captures them.  But this was all a part of Barnabas's plan.  Once a little girl buys them and takes them home, Barnabas and Peter rob the family. Barnabas starts to talk about his grand plan but stops when he hears Bea and Thomas calling for Peter.  Back at the farm, Peter tells this family about Barnabas and his crew.  Peter wants to go back and help him with the big score.  Barnabas wants to rob the farmers market, not for fresh fruit but dried fruit. Peter is ready to take on the villain role and do bad things.<br/><br/>The sequel to Peter Rabbit and based on Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter makes fun of itself multiple times throughout the movie.  Anything you would call absurd, they do it before the scene plays out.  This prediction allows children to love the action while not being taken too seriously by adults. As you see the characters change in Bea's drawings, it will strike a chord in your heartstrings.  See this movie as a matinee with your kids for an easy laugh.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
