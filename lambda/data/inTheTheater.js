    "review":"Bobby dons a monkey mask and fights in the Tiger's Temple's underground bouts. After losing to King Cobra, Bobby argues with the owner, Tiger, over money. Bobby must have a longer and bloodier match if he wants more cash.<br/><br/>Bobby orchestrates people to pickpocket Queenie's wallet. Queenie is a restauranteur and criminal mastermind. Bobby walks to Queenie's restaurant and returns the wallet. Queenie offers him rupees for her troubles, but Bobby wants a job instead. He states that he is willing to do the job no one else wants and doesn't fear getting hurt. Queenie gives Bobby the dishwasher position and tells him to stay out of her business. Bobby crossed off step one of his deadly vengeance plan. Blood will spill.<br/><br/>This movie starts with Bobby's mother, Neela, telling him about Hanuman. It's necessary to watch the beginning because Bobby's story parallels this and explains why Bobby wears the monkey mask. This movie offers gritty action, point-of-view camera angles, and the hero's journey. The plot sprinkles Bobby's need for revenge throughout the story. This film has jerky camera angles. People who suffer from motion sickness should think twice before watching. Otherwise, this movie is for action fans with a worthwhile story and eye-popping imagery. See this movie today.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire",
    "review":"Kong fights off adversaries in Hallow Earth and tries to eat the carcass, but he has an injured tooth. Dr. Ilene teaches about the Titans to her students. The Monarch has several outposts on the Earth's surface and one on Hallow Earth. On the surface, Godzilla battles other Titans attacking the Earth. As Godzilla rests in the Colosseum, a scientist pulls Dr. Ilene aside to examine the latest signals. Others want to dismiss them, but the readings are too steady.<br/><br/>Ilene's daughter, Jia, became distracted in class and drew the same symbols on her paper and desk. Jia informs Ilene that something from Hallow Earth is calling her. Ilene looks closer at Jia's drawings and realizes they match the signals. Ilene takes the information to Bernie for help.<br/><br/>Bernie runs the Titan Truth podcast and posts about his work saving the world. Ilene asks Benie to look over the signals. The signals are a distress call from Hallow Earth and could cause Kong and Godzilla to collide again. Ilene rests until she hears that Kong is coming to the surface. She will travel to the Hallow Earth Access Point to stop Kong and take him back. And Bernie insists on going and filming the events for his podcast.<br/><br/>Bernie and Ilene arrive at the Access Point, and Jia walks to the observation deck. Kong rises to the shore, and Ilene spots the damaged tooth. Trapper, the Titan veterinarian, sedates Kong, removes the tooth, and implants a new one. While Kong relaxes on the shore, Godzilla collects power from nuclear plants worldwide. Ilene believes Godzilla is charging himself for round two. They must bring Kong to Hallow Earth and find the source of this signal before Kong and Godzilla battle again. Dr. Ilene, Trapper, Bernie, and Jia will open the door to a world undiscovered for thousands of years and awaken a monster that can bring forth the second ice age. Can they save the world for humans and the Titans?<br/><br/>This movie is proof that 2024 is the year of the sequels. Godzilla x Kong doesn't disappoint its core audience. It builds on the existing storyline while expanding its world and adding new Titans. The writers understand that viewers want action and stunning graphics. So, they deliver. The CGI team allowed Kong to have emotions without looking too human. They created the other animals and Titans beautifully. The fight scenes between Titans are astounding and equally comical. While the movie is action-packed, the overall theme is discovering where you belong. See this movie if you loved Godzilla vs. Kong. Also, watch it if you didn't. It is a fun time for everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love Lies Bleeding",
    "review":"Jackie meets JJ in his car and sleeps with him for a job. She takes JJ's business card and arrives in the morning to meet the boss, Lou Sr.. He gives Jackie a waitress job, and she humbly accepts the offer.<br/><br/>Louise, a.k.a Lou, manages Crater's Gym and notices a muscular, beautiful woman walk inside. Lou watches the woman, Jackie, work out until two men distract Lou. The gym members tell Jackie that Lou likes women and invite Jackie to accompany them. Jackie refuses and punches one guy when he gets aggressive. And he hits her back. Lou separates them and brings Jackie into her gym to ice her bruises.<br/><br/>Jackie admits that she wants to go to Vegas for a bodybuilding competition. Lou thinks Jackie can win but offers free steroids to give Jackie an edge. Jackie tells Lou about her new job, and Lou advises Jackie to quit. Lou Sr. is Lou's father, and she thinks he's a horrible person. They spend the night together, and Jackie confesses she is homeless. Lou lets Jackie stay with her.<br/><br/>Jackie and Lou meet Lou's sister, Beth, and Beth's husband, JJ, for a dinner date. When Lou sees Beth's black eye, she confronts JJ in the bathroom. She threatens JJ, but JJ tells Lou Jackie slept with him for a job. Lou can't hide her rage and screams at Jackie later. Then, Lou gets a call from a local hospital. Beth was beaten and unconscious. Lou visits Beth in the hospital and wants revenge. Jackie can't handle Lou's pain. She leaves the hospital, sneaks into Beth's home, and kills JJ. Lou gets rid of JJ's body, takes Jackie home, and cleans the crime scene. Lou wants to protect Jackie, but Jackie's rage and addiction are overcoming her senses. Can Lou keep Jackie out of jail?<br/><br/>This film starts as a mob family crime drama. It's shocking, sexy, and funny. The two leads are intriguing with their genuine backstories. Then, the script gets weird. You don't know if Jackie is hallucinating from the steroids or transforming. This movie starts with high potential but fizzles out with indie weirdness.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire",
    "review":"After capturing the Hell's Kitchen's Dragon Ghost, the Ghostbusters - Gary, Callie, Trevor, and Phoebe - meet with Mayor Walter Peck. Mayor Peck threatens to charge Gary and Callie with child labor crimes if they don't bench Phoebe. They return home to extract the ghost from the trap, but the containment unit takes a while to go green. Gary and Phoebe start to worry if the containment unit has enough room.<br/><br/>Nadeem enters Dr. Ray Stantz's store with several of his grandmother's items, looking for a quick buck. At first, nothing catches Ray's eye until he picks up a bronze orb covered in ancient glyphs. Ray scans it with a PKE meter, and it violently vibrates. The orb causes the wall around the containment unit to crack. Dr. Winston takes them to his secret lab. He has a containment unit several times larger than the one in the Ghostbuster's basement. Intern Lucky and Lars try to extract the ghost from the orb, but it protects itself with a layer of freezing ice.<br/><br/>They take the orb to a linguistic specialist, Dr. Hurbert Wartzki. He recognizes it from wall carvings in ancient tombs. It houses a ghostly deity, Garraka, who worked alongside a king to expand the king's empire. Garraka rose and started to freeze the world around him. A group known as the Fire Masters trapped Garraka in the bronze orb to protect the world from his wrath. The Ghostbusters must find a fire master to trap and destroy Garraka for good. If not, Garraka will raise a ghost army, bring forth the second ice age, and end humankind.<br/><br/>This sequel starts with a Robert Frost poem and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. It has jokes for older and newer fans of the franchise. While the script packs action in most scenes, the encompassing theme is family. The elder team reunites to help save the world. The current Ghostbusters are finding their groove as a blended family. Also, the Spengler kids are asserting their independence. Parents should be careful. The plot mentions a sex dungeon and hookers once. Also, it has one mid-credit scene. This film is intriguing, suspenseful, heartfelt, and funny.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The American Society of Magical Negroes",
    "review":"Aren can't generate interest in his yarn sculpture. So, the gallery owner cancels Aren's future art showing. Aren throws his art in the trash and walks to an ATM. Later, a drunken woman forgot her card in the machine and now screams someone stole it. Two men approach and assume Aren is the culprit. But the gallery bartender, Roger, jumps in and makes everything okay. The men and woman leave. Roger asks Aren to go with him to discuss what happened.<br/><br/>Roger noticed that Aren is uncomfortable around white people and becomes overly accommodating. He thinks Aren is the perfect fit for his company and offers Aren a job in client services. Gabbard teaches an introductory class about The American Society of Magical Negroes. Whenever a white person is secure, the world is safer for blacks. They'll all lose their magic if one doesn't put their client's needs first. Aren joins. The leader, Dede, accepts Aren and gives him a signature pocket watch.<br/><br/>Aren wakes up, and his pocket watch is ringing. Roger has his first assignment and wants him to come to work to gather intel. Aren stops at a coffee shop and bumps into a beautiful woman, Lizzie, spilling coffee on her. When Roger calls again, Aren excuses himself and leaves.<br/><br/>Aren's first job is for a graphic designer named Jason. Jason works at Meetbox, and his morale is dangerously low. Roger needs Aren to become his friend, uncover Jason's desire, and direct Jason toward that goal. During their first interaction, Lizzie walks past them. Lizzie and Aren stumble through their second encounter but remember to exchange names. Later, Aren learns that Jason admires and wants to be Meetbox CEO. Roger tells Aren to boost Jason's morale and give him the confidence to climb the corporate ladder. However, Aren notices that Jason's ascent comes at Lizzie's expense. So, Aren tries to spotlight Lizzie in Jason's eyes. Now, Jason wants Lizzie too. Roger tells Aren that Lizzie is off limits because dating her will put the client second and affect their magic. Now, Aren must help Jason get the job and the woman while suppressing his feelings. Can Aren? Should Aren?<br/><br/>This movie leans into the movie trope of the black person saving the day without giving insight into their struggles. The writer could create a searing critique of the films, but they make a comedy with a poignant moment of clarity for Aren and a twist ending. Aren is in a unique position because he doesn't acknowledge his discomfort, and he's bi-racial. Jason lived in a bubble of expected success. Lizzie, a person of color, wants to speak up but puts her desires second for the comfort of others. This film is funny and intriguing, but you won't need to buy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
