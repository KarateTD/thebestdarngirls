    "review":"Ray wakes up with no memory of his past and Dr. Emil by his bedside.  His body was donated by the military to Rising Spirit Technologies or R.S.T. because his family didn’t claim his body.  Ray is R.S.T’s first fully revived candidate.  Ray feels normal but Dr. Emil cuts his hand and puts it under a microscope.  Ray can see nanites repairing his cut before it has a chance to bleed.  Now, Ray is superhuman.  KT sees Ray is having a hard time adjusting so she offers to help Ray remember which alcohol he likes.  As they take shots, Psycho Killer is played over the speaker.  It jogs an agonizing memory.  Before Ray died, Martin Axe drugged him and kidnapped his wife, Gina.  Martin wanted to know how Ray knew about the hostage situation in Mombasa.  Ray explains that he was following orders and never knew who leaked the information.  Martin believes Ray but kills Gina with a bolt gun anyway.  Ray tells Martin that Martin better kill him or Ray will end his life.  Martin takes Ray on his suggestion and kills Ray.  Ray doesn’t know the killer was planted in his head.  Dr. Emil is using Ray to eliminate former RST employees that are a threat to his business.  When Ray discovers the truth, he will need to gain control of his new augmented body and bring down his creator.<br/><br/>Based on the Bloodshot comics, this movie doesn’t hold a candle to the comic.  The plot is a mix of Deadpool and Frankenstein but it still doesn’t excite you.  The graphics are cartoonish, the action mundane, and the plot overdone.  Thank goodness for the comic relief Wilfred.  This lovable computer genius is the wingman or ‘guy in the chair’ every superhero needs.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"With a brand new guitar, Jeremy Camp leaves home for Calvary Chapel Bible College.  After some time on campus, he sneaks backstage to hear and get tips from musician Jean-Luc.  Not only did Jean-Luc give Jeremy tips, but he also let Jeremy tune his guitar.  As Jeremy switches out the guitar, he sees a beautiful girl in the crowd.  After the concert, he introduces himself to Melissa.  The next day, she sees him play guitar under a tree.  She invites him to a bonfire and tells him to bring his guitar.  At the bonfire, Jeremy is surprised to see Jean-Luc there with Melissa.  She explains her relationship with Jean-Luc is complicated.  Jean-Luc wants more from their friendship but she doesn't.  Unknown to Jean-Luc, Jeremy and Melissa start to date.  The couple breaks up after a few months because Jeremy is tired of being a secret.  During winter break, Jeremy gets a phone call from Jean-Luc.  Melissa was taken to the hospital and it’s bad.  Melissa tells Jeremy she has stage C3 cancer.  They removed a cancerous growth, the size of an orange, from her stomach and she will start chemotherapy soon.  To keep the love of his life, Jeremy asks Melissa to marry him.   He is inspired to write songs for and ask fans to pray for his wife.  With those decisions, Jeremy will find the miracle before the supernova.<br/><br/>Based on I Still Believe by Jeremy Camp, this movie is a moving tribute to Melissa and the legacy she wanted to leave behind.  She wanted Jeremy to use her story to make people believe in faith and hope, not lose it during hard times.  It may not have the same outcome as Breakthrough, it does give you a powerful love story within a deeper love story.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jack Cunningham drinks to wake up, in the shower, on the job, and a case to go to sleep at night.  Jack checks his messages and gets one from his old high school principal.  The principal wants him to coach the new boys' basketball team for Bishop Hayes High School.  The team hasn't had a good year since Jack played in 1995. The principal tells Jack to go home, think about it, and give him an answer in the morning.  Jack practices turning down the principal while drinking a case of beer.  With all his practice, Jack shows up the next morning. Jack sits on the sidelines and watches the boys play.  Jack can't fathom having so few players on the team.  They have to borrow players from the J.V. team just to practice.  Jack sees their best shooter can't make a 3-pointer and the best guy on the team doesn't talk. Their way back to the playoffs is his way back to life.  When his past comes back to haunt him, will the old Jack resurface?<br/><br/>This feels like an episode of Intervention without the confessionals.  You don't have a true understanding of how bad Jack's drinking is until he drinks a case of beer in a few hours.  There is a moment of parallel in the storyline. Marcus is begging to stay on the team after Jack kicks him off for being late and disobedient.  By the end of the film, Jack's drinking leads him to a car crash, breaking and entering, and missed practices.  He has to beg to coach the team like Marcus.  Seeing him beg for a second chance to fix his life will rock you to the core.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Emma.",
    "review":"Emma Woodhouse is a 21-year-old woman with no plans to marry.  She is described as handsome, clever, and rich.  She believes women only marry for money, employment, or consequence.  In her 21 years, she has never been distressed or vexed.  However, Emma loves playing matchmaker. When her friend, Harriet comes to visit, she comes with good news.  She met a suitor named Mr. Martin.  Mr. Martin wants to marry Harriet but Emma tells her he isn't good enough.  She must find a man that is above her station.  So Harriet refuses his proposal.  Emma believes Mr. Elton is better suited for Harriet and makes arrangements for them to meet. While Emma thinks she is doing Harriet a service, Mr. Knightley counters her.  He thinks Emma is spoiled, vain, and selfish. Also, he hates seeing Emma wait for Mr. Churchill to return her affection. Mr. Knightley believes Mr. Churchill is stringing Emma along.  Emma continues to wait but she will be challenged when Harriet has eyes for another man ... Mr. Knightley.  If that isn't enough, Mr. Churchill pops in for a surprise visit.  Then her unknowing rival Jane Fairfax is coming to visit.  Leaving Emma in the middle of two men with Harriet and Jane Fairfax standing in her way.<br/><br/>Based on Emma by Jane Austen, this latest adaptation is funny and accurate in the clothing, set design, and manners.  While you won't be doubled over in laughter, you will find a quick chuckle with side-eye glances, polite looks of disgust, and subtle verbal jabs with extreme etiquette. This is a good matinee movie if you like period pieces or Jane Austen. Everyone else should wait for Vudu.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Cecilia has put her plan into place.  As Adrian sleeps, she moves the camera, turns off the alarm, and tracks him in bed on her phone.  She climbs over the cement barrier, runs through the woods and waits for Emily.  As she gets in Emily’s car, she drops the Diazepam she used to drug Adrian and gets in the car.  Emily drives off leaving Adrian behind.  Adrian finds the bottle on the ground and heads home.  Two weeks later, Cecilia is hiding out in James’s home with his daughter Sydney.  Walking to the mailbox causes Cecilia enormous anxiety.  She knows Adrian is waiting for her to let down her guard.  Emily tells her to relax because Adrian committed suicide.  Cecilia breathes a sigh of relief.  The next day, Cecilia gets a letter from Adrian’s brother Tom.  Tom is the executor of Adrian’s estate.  Adrian left Cecilia $5 million to be paid monthly in $100,000 installments without income or estate taxes.  One night, Cecilia gets a feeling that someone is around but sees no one.  She brushes it off and goes to sleep.  Cecilia is awakened to notice her covers on the floor at the foot of the bed.  She pulls the covers but they are stuck on something.  She stares to see footprints appear out of nowhere.  She snaps them and hears something fall to the floor and run. James tells her it’s all in her mind.  Then she remembers his threat.  If you leave me, I will find you.  You won’t see me but I will leave something behind to let you know I was there.  While no one else believes her, she knows Adrian has faked his death and found a way to make himself invisible.<br/><br/>That feeling of someone being in the room, someone watching you, or someone listening to you is a feeling we all know too well.  As the camera pans to an empty spot in the room, you will swear you can see Adrian standing there.  Being invisible allows each attack to be shocking.  This modern twist on The Invisible Man novel is a mix of The Invisible Man movie and Enough.  With strong acting, amazing special effects, and killer designs, the plot feels believable.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
