    "review":"In Chicago, Illinois, Mamie walks into a department store with new shoes to find her son, Emmett, looking at wallets. Emmett pleads to get the wallet with a woman's picture inside. Mamie agrees to buy Emmett the wallet for his vacation to Money, Mississippi. Before he goes, Mamie warns Emmett that the rules in Mississippi are different than in Chicago. He must be on his best behavior, not anger white people, and remain small.<br/><br/>As Emmett boards the train with his Uncle Preacher and his cousins, Mamie worries because this two-week vacation is the longest they have ever been apart. In Money, Emmett plays around while his cousins work the cotton fields. They stop at a local store to hang out and get some refreshments. Emmett goes inside, buys two pieces of gum, gives the cashier, Carolyn, the money, and compliments her. Emmett's cousins see Carolyn run for her gun, so they get into their cars and drive away. Two men come into Preacher's home and threaten him at gunpoint to hand over Emmett. They load Emmett onto the flatbed and have Carolyn confirm Emmett's identity. As several men hold Emmett down, they take him away.<br/><br/>In Chicago, Mamie gets a call from Uncle Preacher saying that Emmett is missing. Then, a friend comes in because a reporter called her with the news. Police found Emmett's body in a river, and he is dead. After fighting with Mississippi, Mamie meets Emmett's body at the same train station she waved goodbye to him. She falls apart.<br/><br/>Mamie and Gene meet the mortician, and Mamie demands to see Emmett's remains. The mortician suggests making Emmett look better, but Mamie tells the mortician that Emmett is perfect. She goes outside to the awaiting media and makes a call to action. Mamie decides to have a public viewing of Emmett, so everyone will know what happened and light a fire under Mississippi to charge the men responsible. This act is the first step of Mamie becoming a civil rights activist and sharing a mother's pain for future generations.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just about Emmett's injustice. It's about the pain, scrutiny, and humiliation Mamie suffered while bravely sitting and testifying during Emmett's murder trial. The director made a bold choice not to show Emmett's murder. However, viewers get a full devastating view of the aftermath. Everything, from hair to clothes to eyewear, was spot on for the period and backed up by photographs. Listen carefully to the news reports in the background. They report about the lynching of Reverand George Washington Lee and his verdict. While Emmett is in Mississippi, you see that Mamie has a nagging feeling that clinches around her. That feeling only a parent knows. This movie will move you to tears and shock you as Mamie gets assistance from T. R. M. Howard, Medgar Evers, and Myrlie Evers and ushers in the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Amsterdam",
    "review":"During World War I, Officer Harold Woodsman refuses to work with his squad leader because Harold believes he is a Jim Crow doctor that won't save him or his fellow soldiers. Their commander puts Dr. Burt Berendsen in charge of the battalion. They both get hit by shrapnel during a firefight in France, and Nurse Valerie works on them. Burt lost an eye in the firefight, so Valerie takes him to the best glass eye makers in town, Paul Canterbury and Henry Norcross. Harold and Burt can see that Paul and Henry are spies. They offer to help Paul and Henry in their missions. For a while, the three make a great team in Amsterdam. However, Burt wants to return to New York to be with Beatrice. Valerie and Harold follow, but Valerie leaves Harold with a Dear John letter days after they arrive.<br/><br/>Harold is a lawyer by 1933, and Burt is a veteran's doctor. Burt takes the cases that no one wants because the soldiers need less than reputable medication. Harold enters Burt's office and asks him to perform a back alley surgery for their captain, Senator Bill Meekins. Bill's daughter, Elizabeth, begs Burt to take the case. Elizabeth thinks someone poisoned Bill and wants Burt to perform an autopsy with Harold's forged paperwork. Elizabeth was right. When Harold and Burt try to tell her, Elizabeth runs away. Voze told Elizabeth that looking into Bill's death could get her killed. They try to get more information, but a hitman shoves Elizabeth onto the street, and a car runs her over, killing her. They go to the Voze's home and find Valerie. She is a Voze and is suffering from a nerve disorder. The three band together to find Bill and Elizabeth's killer. However, they will find a plan to bring down America.<br/><br/>Excellent movie with amazing actors. However, it is too long. You can cut an hour out of this film and get an understanding of the plot. Designers expertly select costumes, medical equipment, slang, and scenery for the age period. Viewers will leave this movie connecting the evildoer's goal and politics today. It's all about power and control, no matter who is at the top.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hector sneaks into the Show Me What You Got auditions and tries to wow the judges but fails. Hector goes to the pet store and asks for an exotic and cute but cheap pet. Then, Hector hears something singing in the back. Hector finds a singing crocodile, buys him, and takes it home. Hector names the crocodile Lyle and practices with Lyle day and night. Then, Hector begs for a stage. Hector owes the producer, so Hector puts up his house as collateral. Lyle knows every word and step. But when he gets on stage for the first time, Lyle freezes. Hector leaves Lyle in his attic and finds a new show on the road.<br/><br/>Eighteen months later, Josh moves into Hector's home with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Primm. He hears singing coming from the vent. Josh walks into the attic and sees Lyle dancing and singing. Josh screams, and Lyle jumps out of the window and into the street. Before Lyle can run again, Josh asks Lyle to help him find his home. The pair form a lasting bond while eating and singing. Mrs. and Mr. Primm discover Lyle, and Lyle instantly persuades them with his talent and caring nature.<br/><br/>Then, the Primms get a knock at the door. It's Hector. When he gave his home as collateral, he added a clause. He can live in the house 15 days out of the year. He sees Lyle has newfound confidence after singing in front of the Primms. So, Hector starts booking shows. But when animal control finds out about Lyle, can Lyle save himself, or will his talent go to waste?<br/><br/>Based on the book series by Bernard Weber, this movie is a cute, wholesome film for the family. You will dance in your seat and laugh at a crocodile out of the water. However, the songs are forgettable outside the context of the movie. The graphic designers made Lyle look authentic but not scary. Their design choices are visible when they add Lyle to the scene with real crocodiles. Younger viewers will learn about being brave and friendship.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Podcaster Bobby celebrates his 1,000,000th subscriber on his channel, The 11th Brick. Also, he is the executive director of the 1st LGBTQ+ Museum in New York City. Bobby meets hook-ups on Grindr and has a cynical view of relationships. Bobby goes to a bar after spending time with friends and sees Aaron on the dance floor. Aaron is a probate lawyer that loves CrossFit but doesn't use dating apps. During the middle of their discussion, Aaron ghosts Bobby in the club, but they meet at the bar. When Aaron disappears again, Bobby finds him and confronts him. Aaron tries to give Bobby his number, but Bobby walks away.<br/><br/>After a trying day at work, Aaron text messages Bobby. They have a flirty but awkward exchange and start to date but never make it official. Bobby doesn't feel like he is in Aaron's league. Aaron feels boring next to Bobby's thought-provoking ways. Bobby and Aaron are two strong men with strong opinions but plagued with self-doubt. Can they overcome themselves to love each other?<br/><br/>This movie is a raunchy and funny rom-com that makes fun of and plays into stereotypes. Aaron and Bobby belong to an ignored community, finding their footing within the world and themselves. With that said, Bobby calls out a significant point. There is a lot of LGBTQ+ history wiped out of American history. Some only hear about Stonewall Riots, but historical events should include every aspect of the person. Also, the writers openly chuckle at Hallmark pandering to the LGBTQ+ community. This film is an easy laugh with some hot and wild scenes for the open-minded.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bri's father, Lawless, is a rap legend in Garden Heights, and she aspires to be a rapper like him. However, he died when she was a baby. Her aunt, Pooh, got Bri a spot at The Ring, a rap arena owned by DJ Hype. Bri sells candy at school to classmates to help her mom. Her friends, Malik and Sonny, believe Bri has what it takes to make it in the music industry.<br/><br/>At her first rap battle, Bri's opponent remarks about her father and mother. Bri can't shake the feeling, so she chokes and leaves The Ring. When an officer sees Bri take something out of her bag and exchange it for money, he demands to see her bookbag. Bri refuses, so the officer grabs her and slams her to the floor. Teachers say Bri is aggressive, but Jay wants to know if the SROs will suffer consequences. The principal says the SROs behavior was inexcusable, but the principal will suspend Bri for a week during the investigation.<br/><br/>Bri uses the time to write more rhymes and gets another shot at The Ring. This time, Bri defeats a locally known rapper, Milez, and Milez's father, Supreme, takes notice. Supreme managed her father until the day Lawless died, but Pooh tells Bri to stay away from Supreme. Pooh and Bri go to the parking lot on cloud nine, but their good mood dissipates when they see Pooh's friend in an altercation with a rival gang. Pooh pulls out a gun and refuses to back down, so the gang leaves.<br/><br/>Pooh and Bri return to The Ring for the next battle, but DJ Hype bans Pooh and Bri for bringing a weapon. Instead of leaving, Bri battles a rapper in the parking lot and wins. In desperation, Bri messages Supreme on Instagram. Bri gets in the booth, but producers hate her single. So she makes a song talking about the rival gang, her family, and the SROs. This song will be Bri's first hit, but she doesn't understand that it's a statement that will anger the streets, her family, and her school.<br/><br/>Based on On the Come Up by Angie Thomas, this movie is a coming-of-age story with prose. This film, at first, feels like 8 Mile, but winning the battle isn't the story's goal. Bri has to find her voice and fight through the pain. She must thrive, not just survive. Bri learns the power of song, its effect on others, and the perils of playing the role. In the end, Bri finds her voice using her pain and stands up for herself and her family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
