    "review":"Buck is a dog who is too big for the house and too tame for the wild. After Buck destroys Judge Miller's important business meal, he makes Buck sleep outside.  During the night, a man calls Buck's name and offers him food.  When Buck runs to the food and eats it, the man traps him inside the box.  After days in the box, Buck wakes up in Yukon, Alaska. After escaping his abusive captures, Buck is bought by Perrault and Françoise.  They run a mail route through the Yukon river with sled dogs.  Perrault believes Buck will fit in nicely but Françoise doesn't.  Before Buck starts his journey he bumps into John. He travels for peace of mind.  His son died and John has not been able to cope.  Buck realizes John dropped his harmonica and runs to John to return it.  John heads off on a ferry up north and Buck starts his journey as a sled dog.  This chance encounter is the start of a call to the wild for them both.<br/><br/>Based on The Call of the Wild by Jack London, this live-adaptation is a feast for the eyes.  The CGI animators were able to give Buck full expressions without taking away his canine qualities.  The actors work well within the blank spaces and have great cued interaction with Buck. The movie is tame and full of heart.  Just like Buck.  While you won't add this movie to your collection.  It is worth seeing in the theaters to enjoy the beauty of Alaska and Buck.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Peter, Billie, and their two sons are ready to enjoy their ski vacation in Austria. For Peter, this getaway means a lot since his father passed away 8 months ago. After a day on the slopes, the family goes to a mountainside restaurant for lunch.  And they mull over what to have, they see snow coming down the hill fast.  At first, they watch in awe.  But as it comes too close for comfort, Peter grabs his phone and runs.  Billie stays with the two boys and hunkers down.  After the show clears, Peter comes back, sits down, and orders soup.  Billie is in disbelief.  She believes Peter abandoned his family to die.  Peter believes he saw they were ok and ran to get help.  Now, their marriage and vision of fatherhood are in limbo.<br/><br/>The Force Majeure by Ruben Östlund remake ramps up to important talks about marriage, family, and duty.  But it just falls flat at the end with even more questions.  While the leads give a strong performance, the script doesn't deliver the storytelling necessary to keep you engaged.  This movie should have gone straight to streaming or DVD, not the theaters.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Photograph",
    "review":"Michael travels to New Orleans to talk to people still affected by the hurricane.  During this interview with Isaac, he comes across several photos.  One photo is Christine, his former flame.  At some point, Isaac and Christine had a hot and heavy romance.  But Christine left for New York to pursue her dream of photography, leaving Isaac behind.  Isaac’s only regret is not going after her.  Michael can feel a story brewing in this tale of lost love and goes home to New York.  He finds Christine’s daughter Mae.  Mae tells Michael her mother died of cancer a few months ago.  But there is more to the story.  Christine left Mae a safe deposit box with 2 letters and photographs.  One envelope has Mae’s name, the other is blank.  Michael can’t get Mae off his mind and attends a museum event he knows she will be attending.  He tries to be smooth and ask her out.  They go out for dinner; then, talk about music and romance.  After the date, they see each other regularly.  While Mae feels she is doomed to repeat her mother’s mistakes, Michael believes their love can make it.<br/><br/>With nods to Kanye, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar, this movie tells the tale of two love stories.  One between Isaac and Christine and the other between Mae and Michael.  Changes in music, technology, and clothes help you bounce from one time period to another.  With each love story, you get the same message.  Mae and Christine aren’t bad at love; they are bad at communication.  This is a good date matinee movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Longclaw watched over young Sonic and told him to keep his powers a secret.  Then, he is spotted and the tribe of echidnas comes after him.  Longclaw throws a ring and it opens a portal to Earth.  She tells Sonic to stay hidden and never stop running.  She gives him a bag of rings and pushes him through the portal.  Ten years later, Sonic loves the town of Green Hills Montana and its people.  Especially, the Donut Lord, Pretzel Lady, and Crazy Carl.  Donut Lord is Tom Wachowski, the sheriff of Green Hills with aspirations of working for San Francisco PD.  The Pretzel Lady is Tom’s wife Maddie.  She is the local veterinarian.  Crazy Carl has reported a blue hair devil running in the forest at lightning speed.  No one believes him.  Sonic runs around town and quickly adds himself inside people’s everyday lives but he is lonely.  Playing baseball alone, he makes the home run and no one is there to cheer for him.  Upset, he runs around the bases as fast as he can and causes an electronic surge that blacks out the Pacific Northwest.  Fearing an alien invasion, the government hires Dr. Robotnik.  They know he is unhinged but he is the best at what he does.  Sonic sees he is about to be discovered and runs to Tom’s house to open a portal.  Tom hears the commotion in his shed and grabs Maddie’s tranquilizer gun.  Before Sonic throws the ring, Tom shoots Sonic in the leg.  Sonic becomes woozy and looks at Tom’s San Francisco T-shirt.  Sonic throws the ring and a portal to San Francisco’s Transamerica Pyramid opens up.  Sonic faints and his bag of rings falls through.  Sonic wakes up in an unlocked cage hearing Tom talk to Dr. Robotnik.  The pair manage to escape Dr. Robotnik.  However, for Sonic to be safe, he has to find his rings and create a portal to a new planet.  And he will need Tom’s help to get there.<br/><br/>Based on Sonic The Hedgehog video game, this movie shouldn’t be mistaken for just a kids' movie.  The writers understood that classic-gamer of the 1991 Sega Genesis console would be in their 30s and 40s now and watching this movie.  So they added a lot of humor for adults and classic game sound effects for the mature viewer.  Don’t worry parents, the jokes aren’t raunchy, just nostalgic. Also, the movie has Quicksilver moments from the blue-haired speed demon and a sneak peek for part 2.  This is a great matinee movie for the entire family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn",
    "review":"Harley Quinn quietly broke up with the Joker, got a job, and got a place. But Gotham doesn't know the volatile couple has ended their relationship.  She has kept it quiet because being the Joker's girlfriend has given her protection.  After hearing friends say she will always go back, Harley decides to make the break-up public by blowing up the Ace Chemical plant leaving her J chain behind. While investigating another murder scene committed by the Crossbow Killer, Detective Renee hears about the plant's explosion. With the plant in ruins, Roman wants his crew to bring Harley Quinn to him.  He gives his second-in-command, Victor, and his newly appointed driver, Black Canary, orders to get Cassandra Cain from lockup.  Cassandra Cain is a young pickpocket and Victor was her latest victim.  Inside his pocket was a 30+ carat diamond.  But Roman doesn't want the diamond, he wants the information etched inside.  It has the banking numbers to Gotham's wealthiest crime family. Roman agrees to give Harley a chance to find Cassandra but he won't make it easy.  He put a bounty on Cassandra's head for 1/2 a million dollars, giving Harley plenty of competition. Before the dust settles, Harley will be elbow deep in laxatives, will protect her sentimental objects, and will form the Birds of Prey.<br/><br/>Most of the history between Harley and Joker is explained.  But if you haven't seen the Suicide Squad, most of the subtle jokes will go over your head.  You will have to keep your eyes and ears open for these jokes.  Other clever jokes are thrown into the dialog and scenes. While watching these women kill, maim, and disfigure, they still have conversations about shoes, hair ties, and nail polish.  But DC fans shouldn't worry, Harley Quinn hasn't gone soft. This movie continues the darkness of DC comics with a world of guns, drugs, and blood.  See this movie in theaters to enjoy the choreography of the fight scenes.  And be on time.  Harley narrates her early life before the Joker, leading you to a deeper understanding of her flawed relationships.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
