    "review":"Grimmel thought he killed all but one of the Night Furies.   When he hears of Toothless's existence, he decides to use his Light Fury to bait and kill him.  Seeing that Berk is overpopulated with dragons and knowing of Grimmel's plan, Hiccup decides to find the hidden world his father, Stoick, talked about when he was a young boy.  There, the residents of Berk and their dragons can live in peace and safety with room for all.  The final installment of the How to Train Your Dragon franchise, answers all questions about their characters' future.  It is beautifully drawn and concluded, even though some jokes fall flat.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 5 years, the Systar aliens have changed Bricksburg to Apocalypseburg.  Now General Sweet Mayhem has kidnapped Emmet's friends to convince Batman to marry Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi.  Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.  This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Baker is faced with a moral dilemma when his ex-wife, Karen, ask him to kill her new husband Frank.  She doesn't want Baker to kill him for the abuse, she wants Baker to do it for their son Patrick.  Patrick and Baker share a unique connection.  When Baker gets a visit from Reid, Baker's world is turned upside down.  This is the most confusing movie since Inception.  You will leave the theater with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After finding Excalibur, Alex has 4 days to gather his knights, find a magical portal, and defeat King Arthur's evil half-sister Morgana.  If he loses, the world will be her slaves.  Don't miss the first 2 minutes for a brief King Arthur recap.  This movie wonderfully stitches together computer animation and the real world with lots of laughs.  See it with the family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

While you may not like the ending, it is honest.  This movie is beautifully shot but some things are lost in the audio choices.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
