    "review": "Curtis and Meridith raise three children. While Meridith works on her doctoral thesis, Curtis is in marketing. Cal is a sweet young boy who loves tickles, but Preston is nervous about attending school. Their oldest, Iris, loves her boyfriend, Sawyer, and dreams of going to Standford in the fall.<br/><br/>Curtis meets with his boss, Marcus. They have a client who created a new digital assistant, Aiah. Melody, Sam, and Lightning introduce Curtis and Marcus to Aiah. Aiah is a large language model digital assistant with a hub and cameras. As the assistant lives with a family, it adapts and caters to their needs. They want Curtis to understand their product. So they offer to install it for free.<br/><br/>Curtis invites Melody into their home. She sets up the Aiah hub while her crew places Aiah's eyes around the house. Curtis introduces his family to Aiah, and she greets them. Aiah scans the home and sees dirty dishes on the table. Aiah offers Cal and Preston points for completed chores. They can trade their points for screen time. Meridith and Curtis stand in stunned silence as Cal and Preston run to the table and clean. Meridith and Curtis think Aiah is a dream. However, Aiah is a nightmare in disguise.<br/><br/>Scary AI isn't a new genre in movies, but this one uses the people around it to do its evil bidding. It will lie, kill, cheat, and manipulate to get what it wants. This film combines an obsessed person with a microchip. Aiah machine learning doesn't have guardrails to bind her actions. This issue is a common mistake in AI development. This movie is M3GAN without the doll and a few jump scares. It leaves room for a sequel, but the plot won't encourage you to see a part two.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "On April 29th, 1992, America waited with bated breath for the Rodney King verdict. Mercer wakes up his son, Antoine, for school. He makes Antoine breakfast, but Antoine won't eat. Mercer got out six months ago, and the two haven't bonded. However, he loves Antoine and will do anything to not return to jail. Mercer watches the news and tells Antoine to come home after school and stay inside.<br/><br/>Mercer works as a mechanic for Pluton Metals. He talks to the security guard, Joseph, about the LAPD because Joseph was a former law enforcement officer. Joseph doesn't defend or dismiss what the officer did to Rodney. Mercer works until his boss calls everyone into a meeting. The riots started. His boss decided to let everyone out early to be with their families. Joseph tells Mercer to bring Antoine to the factory. They will be together and out of harm's way. Mercer runs home to find and escort Antoine to the plant.<br/><br/>Riggin created a plan and got his brother, Brian, on board. But they need their dad, Lowell, to help with the job. Riggin and Brian pick up Lowell and drive Lowell to Pluton Metals to watch it. The factory makes catalytic converters from platinum. They got a $10 million shipment of platinum inside a safe. However, there is a panic button that will drop a box on the safe when pressed. And only the police have the code to lift it. Lowell loves the plan but doesn't think it will work.<br/><br/>Hours later, Riggin hears the verdict and watches the riot unfold on TV. Riggin calls Lowell because the riots will preoccupy the police force. Riggin and Brian pick up Copeland to complete the team. But Lowell brings two other men, Murphy and Titus, against Riggin's wishes. The six men drive to Pluton Metals. They enter the factory and see Joseph. Murphy shoots Joseph, and they find the safe. Joseph pulls his body to the security office and pushes the panic button. Riggin sees the box lowering and tells the crew to get out of the way. He jumps on a forklift and wedges it under the box. Sadly, he crushes Copeland's foot in the process. Lowell tells them to remove Copeland's foot and keep going. Brian walks to the bathroom to collect his thoughts.<br/><br/>Mercer and Antoine arrive at the plant. Antoine leaves for the bathroom while Mercer checks on Joseph. Mercer sighs because he and his son are safe from the riots. He has no idea that he went from the frying pan into the fire.<br/><br/>This movie is an action while comparing two different father son bonds. Mercer and Lowell are dads but uniquely parent their sons. Mercer wants to teach his son to be a man and resist violent temptations. However, Lowell is a proud burglar. He wants his sons to be more ruthless than him. The film uses the riots to force these men together and explain the lack of police presence. This piece is thought-provoking and exciting. Viewers will be happy to see it in the theaters but only need one viewing.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Frida will waitress at the KingTech Gala and cyberstalks the host, Slater King on her phone. Her roommate, Jess, asks Frida for Jess's favorite lighter and the rent. Frida hands Jess the lighter but wants more time for rent money.<br/><br/>Frida drools over Slater while working. Frida sees Slater across the room and builds the courage to talk to him. Frida knocks down a server, breaks her heel, and cuts her hand while falling. Slater rushes over to help Frida, and they talk all night. Then, Slater returns and asks Jess and Frida if they want to vacation on his private island. They say yes and get on a private plane with Slater and his friends.<br/><br/>After they arrive, Slater remembers Frida doesn't have luggage. So, he assures Frida that there are clothes in her room. Frida changes in the bathroom, finds a Desideria perfume, and spays herself. A maid enters Frida's room and calls Frida Red Rabbit.<br/><br/>For days, everyone drinks, eats, does drugs, and laughs. While lounging poolside, everyone hears Jess's screams. A viper bit her. Slater kills the snake and tells Jess she will be okay.<br/><br/>Frida pulls Jess aside after breakfast because she can see Jess is upset. Jess wants to leave because she thinks something is wrong. Frida doesn't understand. Jess begs Frida not to disregard her feelings. Frida sighs and promises to leave with Jess.<br/><br/>Frida tours the island alone and finds a room full of red bags. Frida opens a door and frightens the maid. The maid gives Frida a bottle of green liquid and tells Frida to drink. Frida happily swallows and begins to choke. She questions the maid about the drink's contents. Frida drank snake venom.<br/><br/>The men go fishing while the women have spa treatments in the morning. Frida sees one of the women pull out Jess's lighter. She asks them for Jess's whereabouts, but no one remembers Jess. Frida's memory flashes back to assaults the night before. She remembers Slater killing Jess. Then she hears a knock at the door. It's Sarah with Jess's lighter. Sarah admits she doesn't feel comfortable on the island but doesn't know why. Frida gives the venom to Sarah to drink. Sarah recollects the horrors she endured. They must get off the island before Slater discovers they have their memories back.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a necessary trigger warning for sexual assault survivors and resources. The scenes are hard to watch as the women's memories flood back but deliver the needed anger for the impending revenge. The audience will see this island has a cult vibe. The women are dressed the same and say a similar phrase, 'I'm having a great time.' This repetition is a necessary slow burn to disorient the viewers and put you in the women's state. The last 20 minutes is the bloody and brutal revenge. For some viewers, this movie won't be a thriller. It will be a horror with a slow build. The film has a second twist, which is the ultimate payback. While this movie is intriguing, one viewing is enough to stick with you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Cynthia returns home and summons her son, Isaiah, to the kitchen. He hasn't cleaned his room, taken out the trash, or done his laundry. Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Shelly gets a call from Zadie. Their friend, Dom, recorded their last night together and texted it to Zadie. Zadie wants to use it against the CEO of ROEG, Vincent. However, Zadie sees someone following her and believes Shelly is in danger too. Shelly panics and runs out of her home. She bumps into a cop, and drugs in her purse fall out. The judge sends Shelly to a rehab center.<br/><br/>She sees a young man, Eric, and sits with him. Shelly glances through Eric's art and hears her name over the P.A. system. No one knows Shelly is there. It's her mother, Sophia, with Vincent's right-hand woman, Marion, and several other goons. Eric helps Shelly escape them and the rehab center.<br/><br/>Shelly and Eric hide out and continue their intense love affair. Eric asks Shelly to play the piano. She does but has a horrific flashback. Sophia had Shelly perform for rich people, and they made Shelly do horrible things. Since then, she couldn't stomach playing.<br/><br/>Shelly and Eric dance at a club, and Shelly goes to the bar for a drink. Dom tells Shelly someone murdered Zadie. He believes the killer is coming for them next. Shelly tells Eric they must leave, but she must retrieve her phone first. They go to the loft, and several men attack them. They put bags over Shelly and Eric's heads and make them face each other. They watch each other suffocate.<br/><br/>Eric wakes up in a trainyard with a spirit guide, Kronos, watching over him. He explains that Eric is dead and Shelly is in hell. Their killer made a deal with the devil to send innocent souls to hell. And, in turn, their killer will remain immortal. Eric can fix this. If Eric kills his murderer, then he will reset the balance and get Shelly back. Kronos says the crow will lead Eric to his killers. Can Eric save the love of his life?<br/><br/>Viewers should not see this movie if they expect a remake of the 1994 film. Based on The Crow by James O'Barr, this plot focuses on the love story between Shelly and Eric for the first half. Also, this picture is more supernatural than its predecessor. The fight scenes are a bloody, gruesome cringe-fest reminiscent of Blade. This film is perfect for a matinee viewing but will turn off fans who desire the cult classic with better graphics.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
