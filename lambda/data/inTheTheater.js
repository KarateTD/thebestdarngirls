    "review":"After his basketball career ended, Derrick Taylor started a sports PR firm with his friend Rafe.  Derrick and Rafe are at the top of the sporting world, and Derrick wants to start a family with Tracie. Derrick and Rafe travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, and Derrick tells Rafe he is having problems in his marriage. Rafe grabs Derrick's hand and takes off his wedding ring.  Rafe says for tonight, Derrick is single, and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  At the next bar, Derrick sees a beautiful woman and introduces himself as Darren, and she introduces herself as Val. They dance and end up in bed. They go for round 2, then he gets his phone and leaves.  At home, things are better than ever between Tracie and Derrick until someone breaks into their house.  Derrick fights the man off, but the burglar leaves him with bumps and bruises.  He tells Tracie to call the police, and to Derrick's surprise, the officer in charge is Val.  She gets joy out of watching Derrick squirm as she dances around telling his wife.  This game isn't the only game Val likes to play.  As she manipulates Derrick, someone will betray him, the body count rises, and he will have to reclaim his name.<br/><br/>This movie starts like Fatal Attraction but ends more like a gangster movie.  Val plays the puppet master with Derrick and her ex-husband.  You understand she is a femme fatale, but you don't know her ultimate goal until halfway into the movie. And don't worry, this movie doesn't end on a cliffhanger.  Everything is tied into a neat bow when the credits roll.  This film is a decent date, matinee movie, but for 16 and up.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Army Ranger Captain Artemis listens to the last recording of the missing Bravo team.  She and her Alpha team work for the Joint Security Operations and only stand a few clicks from the Bravo team's last known whereabouts.  As they approach the destination, they see a storm ahead.  Since it's unlike any storm they have seen in the desert, they believe it's a diversion to hide hostiles.  They ready their guns and head towards the lightning storm.  Soon the storm whips their humvees like a can down the street, and the team like rag dolls.  After their vehicles hit the ground, the desert is now a dune. Until they figure out where they are, they will move forward and keep their eyes open.  Dash stops the caravan after seeing an enormous array of bones coming out of the ground. Then an arrow flies through the sky and hits one of the bones, releasing red dust.  They start to fire on the arrow's origin, but something comes out of the ground.  A monster they have never seen and have no way to defeat.  They don't know where they are, are ill-equipped, and are in danger. Can the team make their way home?<br/><br/>Based on the Monster Hunter video game, this is a movie meant for the big screen.  With larger than life monsters, the graphic designers stayed honest with the source material. With any monster movie, you get a few jump-scares, along with Predator and Alien moments.  While this movie is perfect for IMAX, you can skip Dolby.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sol and Jennifer cross paths but never see each other until she walks into a sports bar with friends on their way to dinner.  David approaches Jennifer and her friends with two of his friends.  Before David can start his crushed pinky toe story, Sol walks away to get more drinks, and Jennifer isn't far behind. Sol invites Jennifer to go running the next morning. They end their run, and Sol takes her to the local merchants' market. Jennifer discovers Sol, a digital marketer, has a passion for cooking.  She asks Sol to cook for her now.  Or never.  As time goes by, Jennifer can see Sol's not happy at his job, but he wants financial stability.  So she asks Sol to move in and lighten his financial load.  Even though they are living together, Sol worries he can never be a chef because he didn't go to culinary school.  Jennifer has a bright idea.  She invites their friends over for Thanksgiving dinner.  By the end of the night, Sol puts in his 2-week notice.  Now, Sol is a chef at Gigi's, Jennifer's cousin's, restaurant and is in love. So much so, he proposes to Jennifer, and she says yes.  She can't wait to spend the rest of her life with Sol, but that time could be cut short.  Sol's stomach pains have worsened, and a biopsy revealed cancer.  When Sol falls apart, can Jennifer keep him together?<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, it doesn't take much to see where this film goes.  Reminiscent of 2 Hearts, this movie isn't a tear-jerker but a warning to live and do better. In a state of self-sacrifice, he wants to give Jennifer an out.  But she refuses.  Her love for him goes before and beyond wedding vows. You know the pain of impending doom is there. This is a love story that accomplished more in a short time than many do in a lifetime.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1994, Renato and his father, Flavio, loved to spend time together being mischievous. They played with remote-controlled airplanes, annoyed the townspeople, and solved riddles.  Then, the Mexican market crashed, and the work dried up.  Flavio left his wife, Tere, and Renato to make money in America and send it back to them.  Renato watched Flavio walk away and never saw him again.  Today, Renato is a highly respected engineer that runs a thriving aeronautics company. He gets a call from Katherine, and she tells Renato that she and Flavio are married, Flavio is sick, and they are living in Chicago.  Katherine asks Renato to visit Flavio before he dies.  Renato has no plans to visit his father because he is getting married in 5 days and he doesn't want to see him.  Pam, Renato's fiancé, tells him to see his father and make peace because it may help him connect with his future stepson, Emilio.  With Pam's encouragement, Renato flies to Chicago to see Flavio. Flavio is overjoyed to see his son again, but Renato feels only pain.  Then another man walks into the room. As recognition sets in, Renato can't believe what he heard, the man called Flavio 'dad.'  Flavio introduces Asher to Renato.  Flavio wants to explain what happened to him to Renato and Asher, so Flavio created a scavenger hunt to tell his story.  Flavio tells his sons 'Eloise' has all the answers and hands them an envelope with the name Evaristo on it and a key inside. In the middle of the night, Katherine calls.  Flavio died. Pam convinces Renato to go on the scavenger hunt to get the answers Flavio couldn't give, but he needs to be home in time for their wedding.  What's the worst that can happen?<br/><br/>This not-yet-buddies comedy packs a lot of emotion in less than 2 hours.  When Renato sees Asher, he sees everything he hates about American and his father. Asher, on the other hand, wishes he could be Renato because Asher always felt weird and out of place. Both men want the father the other had.  And Flavio's clues lead his sons on a journey to learn what happened to him and why he stayed in America.  He never excuses his actions.  Flavio only explains and asks for forgiveness.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Croods: A New Age",
    "review":"Guy, much to Grug's chagrin, joined the Croods as they search for Guy's Tomorrow. Grug worries Guy will pull Eep away from the pack, but Ugga tells him that's the natural order. Guy and Eep confirm Grug's fears after he overhears them in the sleep-pile.  Grug gives Eep a rock with their picture and asks her to join him, and start a new pack.  Eep says yes, and Grug leaves the sleep-pile and finds something new.  He wakes up the family and brings them to a high fence.  They knock a hole in the barrier and see rows of fresh food and beautiful flowers.  Before the family gorges, Grug welcomes them to Tomorrow, and now, the pack can stay together, forever.  Then Grug sees something he hasn't seen in a long time, a sweet fruit he called a banana.  Just as he grabs it, it sets off a trap, and a net pulls the entire Crood family up a tree.  Two figures emerge and poke the family with sticks but see similarities. Then, introduce themselves as Phil and Hope Betterman.  After further inspection, they see Guy and hug him.  Before Guy's parents died, the Bettermans were friends with his family, but after the tar killed them, the Bettermans lost track of Guy.  They bring the Croods to their treehouse and introduce the Croods to their daughter, Dawn.  As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
