    "review": "Elio hides under the table, mourning the lost of his parents, as his aunt Olga orders food from the Montez Air and Space Museum cafeteria. Olga looks under the table, and Elio is gone. She searches the museum and finds Elio listening to a presentation about the Golden Record. He ponders if there are others out there. It will be a place he could finally fit in.<br/><br/>Elio stakes out places near the Montez Air Force Base to be abducted. One night, Bryce joins Elio on the beach with his hand radio. Bryce asks about the other club members when Bryce's friend, Caleb, joins them. Elio hears a strange signal coming from the radio, and Caleb pulls the radio from Elio's hands, and they fight. The device hits Elio in the eye, and all three boys return to the base.<br/><br/>Major Olga is furious because Elio skipped school and got into a physical altercation. She tells Elio to wait in her office so she can attend a short meeting. A contractor, Gunther Melmac, picked up a signal from outer space. It's the same sound Elio heard from his radio. Melmac believes it's aliens and is ready to send a signal back. Everyone leaves. Elio jumps out of the trash, records a message for aliens to abduct him, and sends it. It shuts down the base.<br/><br/>At her wits' end, Olga takes Elio to a summer academy to curb his behavior. Caleb and Bryce spot Elio's arrival, and Caleb plots his revenge. Caleb, Bryce, and two other boys pull Elio out of his tent. Elio opens his eyes and sees the world around him frozen. He wiggles out of the boys' clutches, and a green beam lifts him off the ground. Elio cheers as he floats to the ship.<br/><br/>Ooooo, a liquid supercomputer, greets Elio and introduces him to the leaders of the Communiverse. Ambassadors Questa, Helix, and Tegmen greet Elio, assuming he's the leader of Earth. They are willing to accept him as a member of the Communiverse but squirm over their second visitor, Lord Grigon. The won't welcome him. Grigon threatens to make them all pay before leaving. They prepare for a fearful retreat and inform Elio that he must return to Earth. Elio can't bear the thought of being alone again and offers a trade. He will broker a deal with Grigon. They agree to let Elio stay if he persuades Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. Will Elio save the Communiverse and find a place where he belongs?<br/><br/>This Pixar film covers acceptance and belonging while honoring a parent's sacrifice and understanding. Emotions aside, this film is visually splendid. The animators didn't use alien stereotypes. They created something new and unique. It's easy to see how this movie can grow and expand into a series on the Disney Channel. While the story will not make you cry, it does connect to the audience. There aren't any sly adult jokes, but this picture is funny. This film is confusing because it lacks a classic villain, leaving the plot more complex. Young viewers will enjoy it, but won't comprehend the message. Overall, Elio is an entertaining but elaborate film for the entire family. It has stellar visuals and a mid-credit scene.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Matchmaker Lucy meets with clients before returning to work and celebrating her 9th engagement. A day later, Lucy attends her clients' wedding. She mingles with the guests before the nuptials and collects business cards. She doesn't see the groom's brother, Harry, eavesdropping on her clever pitch to the single attendees.<br/><br/>After the wedding, Harry moves the place cards to sit next to Lucy. They discuss her job, love, and what people want. She offers to help him, but he wants her. Harry offers to get her a drink, and Lucy requests a Coke and a beer. Before Harry stands, a waiter, John, sets both drinks on the table. Lucy gawks at her ex-boyfriend before he retreats. Later, Lucy finds John at the loading docks, and they discuss the past. He offers her a ride, and she accepts before returning to the reception. Harry asks Lucy to dance with him, and she obliges. As they sway on the dancefloor, John looks on with regret. Harry is a handsome, wealthy man willing to use his resources to woo Lucy. Lucy will have to choose between John and Harry, but she believes she isn't good enough for either of them. Who will she choose?<br/><br/>This film settles into the dark corners of dating. It doesn't try to make one gender look better than the other. The movie forces the audience to reflect on themselves. It forces Lucy to look beyond the checklist and see her clients as more than math problems. Like 'Sex in the City', Materialists use New York as its backdrop. The sounds of the city become the backing track to the chaos. This picture leans more towards romance than comedy, so it's missing something you can't put your finger on. It's up to the viewer to decide if Lucy made the right choice.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Li practices Kung Fu in a dojo owned and operated by his uncle, Shifu Han. A student runs in and warns Han that the director, his niece Dr. Fong, is there. She got a job in New York. She and Li will move there and start a new life. Han urges Dr. Fong to let Li continue his training, but she refuses. She makes Li vow to never fight again.<br/><br/>After Dr. Fong and Li move into their New York apartment, Li leaves to find dinner and toilet paper. He walks to Victor's Pizza and orders a stuffed crust. Victor tells Li to find a strip mall. However, Victor's daughter, Mia, offers a softer approach.<br/><br/>After school, Li walks home and sees Mia arguing with a vendor. Li admits his first day was complex. They cross paths with a Kung Fu dojo, and Li freezes and stares into the storefront window. The owner, O'Shea, reminds Mia that Victor owes him money. Mia warns Li to stay away from that dojo. They make an exchange. He will teach her Mandarin if she shows him around New York.<br/><br/>During their first lesson, Li and Mia take the train. They bump into Mia's ex-boyfriend, Conor. He sucker-punches Li as Mia disembarks the train. Conor is the reigning Karate champion and trains at O'Shea's dojo. Conor will defend his championship in the 5 Burroughs Tournament.<br/><br/>Later, Li sees three men harassing Victor, and Li fights them off. Victor, a former boxing champion, asks Li to teach him Kung Fu. A fight is coming up, and O'Shea's thugs will be in attendance. If Victor beats them, he will earn enough money to pay O'Shea. The fight starts well, but O'Shea's fighter throws a dirty punch, landing Victor in the hospital. Li falls into a deep sadness.<br/><br/>Han learns about Li's suffering, so Han travels to New York. He encourages Li to enter the tournament and win the prize money for Victor. However, the competition focuses on Karate, not Kung Fu. To help Li, Han must find Daniel and persuade him to train Li in seven days. Can Li win the competition and add another branch to Miyagi's tree?<br/><br/>The film opens with Mr. Miyagi teaching Daniel the history of Karate. It's a recap of Mr. Miyagi's importance to the franchise. The fight scenes are nearly perfect and include training techniques from the original films. The violence may be too much for younger viewers, but the graphics and commentary give the audience a video game feel. The script handles humor with emotional topics with ease while teaching important life lessons about perseverance, respect, and strength. This film will revitalize the franchise.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "IMF agent Ethan Hunt sits in a private bunker when he gets a VHS tape directly from President Erika Sloane. Since Ethan did not return the cruciform key in his last mission, the Entity has roamed free on the internet. Without intervention, it will have the world's deadliest forces under its control. The world has two choices. They can become a slave to the Entity or shut down the internet. However, the latter would ensure worldwide chaos. President Sloane gently demands that Ethan turn himself and the key over to her.<br/><br/>With Paris's tip, Ethan and Grace travel to London to find Gabriel. Gabriel gets the drop on them, and they wake up bound. Gabriel admits that the Rabbit's Foot wasn't a biological weapon. It was a device that could give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape and meet with Luther and Benji. Luther hands Ethan a device with malware. If Ethan attaches the device to the Entity's source code, it will infect the Entity, and they can trap it.<br/><br/>Paris takes Ethan to a capsule that Gabriel used to communicate with the Entity. Ethan lets the Entity into his mind, and it discovers a plan of attack. However, Ethan sees the plan too. The Entity plans to escape to the Doomsday Vault in South Africa.<br/><br/>Ethan finally falls in line and turns himself over to the President. However, he urges President Sloane not to arrest him because the Entity knows Ethan is the only one with the power to stop it. She writes a note, seals it, grabs the key, and slips it to the guard. She demands that the guards take Ethan to his cell. The guards take him to an awaiting helicopter and give him the key and the note. Now, Ethan must find the location of the source code, retrieve it, and capture the Entity in South Africa. If not, the Entity will fire the world's nuclear weapons. Can Ethan move in the shadows one more time and save the world?<br/><br/>This eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers a heart-pounding thrill ride with unthinkable missions, setbacks, heartbreak, and breathtaking action. The stunts and graphics are smooth and don't distract from the plot. The film doesn't rely heavily on humor because it focuses on the emotional aspect. It does use a similar setup for two scenes. However, they don't feel redundant. Unlike other films, this picture has three nerve-racking moments running simultaneously. Don't be surprised if you hold your breath. It is one of the best Mission: Impossible films of the series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Lilo and Stitch",
    "review": "The Grand Councilwoman called an emergency meeting of the United Galactic Federation. Scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba created an alien he calls Experiment 626. It's bright, indestructible, and can evade capture. Councilwoman imprisons 626. 626 escapes before the Councilwoman makes it to the ship's deck. He lands in Honolulu, Hawaii. She plans to vaporize the planet until Agent Wendell Pleakley stops her. Earth is a habitat for the endangered mosquito species. Grand Councilwoman tells Wendell and Dr. Jumba to travel to Earth and capture 626 before he wreaks havoc on the planet.<br/><br/>Lilo arrives at her hula recital late and jumps in place. Another dancer, Myrtle, teases Lilo during the performance, so Lilo pushes Myrtle off the stage. When Nani arrives, Lilo is gone. Nani rushes home to apologize, but Lilo locks Nani outside. Nani grabs a brick to break a window when their caseworker, Mrs. Kekoa, arrives. She gives Nani three tasks to complete in four days, or Nani will lose custody. Lilo agrees to be better. Then she sees a shooting star. She pushes Nani out the door and wishes for a best friend.<br/><br/>Lilo's shooting star was 626's crash landing. Unfortunately, 626 runs into oncoming traffic. Then, a tour bus knocks him out. The driver assumes 626 is a dog and brings it to the animal shelter. Soon after 626's arrival, Dr. Jumba and Agent Wendell enter Earth's atmosphere. And CIA Agent Cobra Bubbles searches the woods to discover who or what left a crater.<br/><br/>Nani's neighbor, Tūtū, takes Lilo to the animal shelter. Lilo plays with the dogs and finds a cage with bent wires. She looks around, and a blue dog says hi to her. Lilo believes her shooting star wish worked. Lilo's latest friend will turn her world upside down and test Lilo's understanding of Ohana.<br/><br/>This live-action remake uses the original as its foundation but adds believable aspects to the film. Fans of the original can spot the differences. These changes don't feel like much. However, it changes the direction of the story. The plot centers around Ohana, but the conclusion is more realistic. The graphics between Stitch and the other animated characters are vivid, life-like, and true to the original. Also, the designers took a lot of time perfecting the moments between Stitch and Lilo. However, Stitch's interactions with other humans can be disjointed and bothersome. Disney adaptations have been hit-and-miss in the past, but this film is a gold standard.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
