    "mtitle":"80 for Brady",
    "review":"In 2017, Lou, Betty, Maura, and Trish got together to watch the New England Patriots in the NFL Conference Championship game. The true-blue friends celebrate the Patriots beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and plan to get together at Lou's house for Super Bowl LI. They watch the Pats Nation and hear the hosts are sponsoring a giveaway for Super Bowl tickets.<br/><br/>Maura still feels the loss of her husband and wants to get away from her home. Trish wrote Gronk fan fiction using her dog's name as a pseudonym. Betty is a retired math professor that constantly proofreads her husband's textbook manuscript. Lou started her love for Tom Brady the day he came off the bench and played in his first NFL game. She was going through chemo, and her friends came over to help. Seeing Tom overcome gave her the strength to keep fighting. However, Lou went to her oncologist for a checkup and now avoids the doctor's calls. Lou worries her cancer is back and wants to have a good time with her friends in case it's the last time.<br/><br/>Maura, Betty, and Trish come to Lou's house because Lou has a surprise. Lou won the tickets, and they are going to the Super Bowl. After breaking an unconscious Maura out of the retirement home, the women fly to Houston, Texas. During breakfast, they decided the most responsible person, Betty, should keep the tickets. Betty puts them in her strap-on, and they leave for the Super Bowl Experience. Betty can't ignore her grumbling stomach and enters Guy Fieri's hot wing eating contest. Betty puts down her strap-on and wins the contest. The friends eat in Guy's trailer to celebrate Betty's win. Trish tells them about the party, and they decide to go after Guy tells them he is going.<br/><br/>The women meet new friends, play poker, get high, and dance at the party. Lou asks for her Super Bowl ticket to go without them in the morning. Betty realizes she left the strap-on at the contest. They will lie, fight, and dance to get their tickets back and make it to the Super Bowl.<br/><br/>This film is Golden Girls mixed with a PG-13 Girls Trip, centered around the 2nd best comeback in Super Bowl history. At the plot's core is a tale of friendship during hardship. Each woman battles personal issues differently. This movie is purely funny, but it's not for younger viewers because of drug use and mild sexual language. However, older teens and adults will laugh without Hangover-style humor. And let's not forget the shout-out for Broadway Cares. This film is great for the theater, but you won't watch it again until it's free on cable.<br/><br/>* out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Knock at the Cabin",
    "review":"Wen catches grasshoppers to study them. She sees a man, Leonard, approaching in the distance. Leonard apologizes for meeting under these circumstances, but he and his friends need to talk to Wen's parents. He tells Wen to tell her parents to let them in the cabin. After seeing three more people walking up with weapons, Wen runs back to the dwelling to alert her fathers, Eric and Andrew. They look out the window and see four people with handmade weapons surrounding the house. Andrew and Eric attempt to barricade the home, but Leonard, Sabrina, Adriane, and Redmond break inside. Andrew attacks Redmond and almost takes him out. Amidst the battle, Eric suffers a concussion. When Eric wakes up, the home invaders have tied him and Andrew to chairs, and Sabrina bandages his head wound.<br/><br/>Leonard explains that someone chose their family to make a sacrifice. One member of the family has to kill another to stop the apocalypse. Each member of Leonard's group will ask Eric and Andrew to choose. And for each no, thousands will die. In the end, the world will die except for Eric, Andrew and Wen. They all had visions of the apocalypse leading them to the cabin. Eric thinks they are part of a religious cult, but Andrew believes they are a hate group trying to convert them. Leonard asks them if they will choose a sacrifice. Eric and Andrew's answer will start a horrific 24 hours. Is it real?<br/><br/>Based on The Cabin at the End of the World by Paul Tremblay, the premise for the movie is a long-standing morality question. Can you sacrifice one person you love for humanity? Eric and Andrew's 'nos' have a direct consequence, but they believe the TV broadcast are deep fakes or expertly timed. With M. Night Shyamalan's movies, viewers expect a twist. However, the anticipated twist falls flat. The plot does a tremendous build-up with stellar performances, but it alters the book's ending. The performances, especially Dave Bautista, are outstanding. They make this movie worthy of the big screen.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Missing",
    "review":"June attempts to adjust to her mother, Grace, dating Kevin. Kevin and Grace decided to take a vacation to Columbia. However, June is upset the trip overlaps Father's Day. June's father, James, died from a brain tumor when she was a young child. Although June is 18, Grace asked her friend, attorney Heather, to look in on June occasionally. Grace and Kevin leave in an Uber, and June kicks off a slew of alcohol-fueled parties.<br/><br/>After a week, June gets a reminder to pick up Grace and Kevin from the airport. June sets up her camera, makes a sign saying 'Welcome back from prison mom,' and waits. June waits for hours, but Grace and Kevin never show. Grace calls Heather, and Heather sends Grace an international missing persons form and calls FBI Agent Park who can assist. Agent Park informs June that the United States doesn't have jurisdiction in Columbia. June calls Grace and Kevin's hotel and asks for their whereabouts. With the help of Google translate, she uncovers that Grace and Kevin left without their luggage. June looks at photos of the hotel online and sees security cameras. June decides to find Grace with or without anyone's help. She will uncover Kevin's lies, Grace's secrets, and the dark side of internet sleuthing.<br/><br/>This film echoes the same heart-pounding mystery you get from Searching, but viewers don't need to watch the previous movie to watch Missing. Viewers see the family did have a close relationship before James died, but teen rebellion drove a wedge between them. The film's technology use helps guide viewers through June's thought process. June finds locations, translates languages and uses live streaming to find her mother. With June's camera focused on her, you see the dread as she discovers more horrific information. Be ready to yell at the screen and cheer in relief. If you like Searching, you will love its standalone sequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"House Party",
    "review":"Kevin is a single father living with his parents. They plan to retire soon and sell the house. So they remind Kevin that he needs to find a new place to live. He works for a cleaning service, but it doesn't pay enough for Kevin to find a new home. Kevin loads his daughter, Destiny, in the car when three men, YTD, pull up and threaten him. They are upset because Kevin's friend, Damon, stole their cousin's chain during a party.<br/><br/>Damon lives with his aunt, but she's threatening to throw him out if he doesn't pay his rent on time. He promotes parties on his social media to attract more attendees. She asks how much he gets paid, and he doesn't. She reminds Damon that partying without pay is partying. Damon leaves to join Kevin at work.<br/><br/>Damon arrives at the cleaning job at a huge mansion, but no one will say who owns the home. Kevin tells Damon he needs $10,000 to pay for Destiny's school and get a place. Then Kevin tells Damon that YTD fired them and questions Damon about the chain. Damon denies taking the chain but wants to throw a party. Then, Kevin's high school crush, manager Venus, calls. The last client has a video of Damon and Kevin manhandling statues and doing drugs on the property. Venus tells Kevin that the boss will fire them on Monday.<br/><br/>After Damon looks around the home, he discovers it belongs to LeBron James. After listening to Kevin's woes, Damon thinks they can make the money they need in one night. They can give the boss fake keys after cleaning, charge a premium for the party, party, clean up, and return the real keys without anyone noticing. This party will put their promotion business on the map. Easy enough, right?<br/><br/>This reboot references the original material and has some of the main cast for fans of the cult classic. The script starts funny and gets crazy. However, the plot gets extremely weird. It becomes unnecessarily violent and bloody and turns into a mix of The Lovebirds and Gladiator. Finally, the movie jumps to its original plot and provides comical and caring moments. This disturbing sequence was unneeded with the slew of cameos, a koala, and plenty of damage. This film is for fans looking for something new, not a blast from the past.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Plane",
    "review":"Captain Brodie Torrance prepares his crew to fly from Singapore to Hawaii on Trailblazer 119. Brodie talks to the flight crew before loading the passengers. There will be 14 passengers, three flight attendants, and the co-pilot, Samuel Dele, on the flight.<br/><br/>Samuel looks at the Doppler report and sees the flight plan has them going through a storm. Brodie asks the Trailblazer rep if they can fly around it. The rep believes the storm will be over once they get there and says no. Fight attendant Bonnie walks into the cockpit as the rep leaves. She informs Brodie that RCMP Officer Knight wants to talk to him about a passenger. Officer Knight will use the flight to transport a prisoner, Louis Gaspere, back for a murder charge.<br/><br/>The plane takes off without issue, and the attendants make their rounds. They hit the storm and tell the passengers to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts. Lightning strikes the plane and takes out the electrical system. Brodie and Samuel fly blind and without communication with air traffic control. Brodie fears he needs to make a water landing but sees land on the way down.<br/><br/>Brodie breathes a sigh of relief when they land on the remote island but knows it will be a while before help can find them. Samuel thinks it will be longer because he discovered they are in Jolo. Jolo has no police, and criminals and separatists run the island and population. Brodie remembers seeing a structure on the way down. He hopes it will have a phone. When two passengers volunteer, Brodie lies and says Louis asked to go. Brodie hopes to signal for help. However, a villager spotted the plane going down and told Datu. Datu runs the local gang and orders his men to find the aircraft to collect supplies and hostages. Landing the plane was only half the battle.<br/><br/>If you watch the trailers, you will anticipate the crazy moments. But don't let that distract you from the setup. Every ounce of the beginning is necessary for the plot. Also, you get an insight into crisis management. This movie will make you wait with bated breath until you know everyone is safe. You won't have the urge to buy this movie, but you won't regret seeing it in the theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
