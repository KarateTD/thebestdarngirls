    "mtitle":"The War with Grandpa",
    "review":"After several incidents, Sally leaves work early, drives to her father's, Ed, home, and asks him to live with her family. Sally and her husband, Arthur, have three children, Mia, Peter, and Jenny.  Sally and Arthur need to make room for Ed. Peter doesn't understand why he has to give up his room because Ed can stay in the attic.  Sally explains the stairs will be too much for Ed.  So, Peter will move, and that's final.  The next day, Peter's friends tell him he has rights, and he should fight for them. Peter's friends tell him to declare war to get his room back.  So, Peter writes a Declaration of War and slips it under Ed's door. It states Ed has 24 hours to vacate the room, or he will suffer the consequences. Twenty-four hours later, Peter makes the first strike.  After the second strike, Ed is ready for battle, but he calls Peter to make Rules of Engagement.  First, no collateral damage.  Second, no telling. Peter and Ed use tools, food, and their friends to fight the battle, but who will win the war.<br/><br/>Based on The War with Grandpa by Robert Kimmel Smith, this movie is full of hijinks and fun.  While the two go to war, they try to have peace talks along the way.  Whether it's with a neutral third party or on a boat, they do try to make peace.  However, Peter learns the cost of war and why war goes on for so long. The sweetest moment in this movie is during the war.  Ed discovers someone is bullying Peter, and during their war, Ed comes to his defense. This movie is clean fun for older kids and adults.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Yellow Rose",
    "review":"Rose begs her mom, Priscilla, to let her go to the Broken Spoke Bar in Austin with her friend, Elliot.  Priscilla, knowing her daughter will be 18 soon, agrees. They dance, sing, drink, and meet country singer Dale Watson.  As Elliot drives back, Rose falls asleep. Rose wakes up and sees ICE taking Priscilla away.  Priscilla yells to Rose to find the letter, while Elliot pulls Rose away and they drive off in his car.  Rose tells Elliot to pull over, then reveals her biggest secret.  She and her mom are illegal.  Her mother believed her father's status would trickle down to them.  But when he died, Priscilla learned that was not true. The next day, Elliot takes Rose back to the Inn.  She sneaks in to find the letter Priscilla told her about during her arrest. Inside the envelope is cash, a necklace, and instructions for Rose.  Priscilla instructed Rose to go to her aunt Gayle's home and use the paperwork to have Gayle take power of attorney, then start the citizenship paperwork.  However, Rose will learn that blood isn't enough to make a bond, but friendship and kindness can do anything.  Rose will use the music she creates to build those bonds.<br/><br/>Set to the pain and struggle of country music, Rose's life mirrors so many undocumented children living in the United States today.  The writers are careful not to get too political or place the blame on one person. Rose, like her song states, runs with no place to go.  She has no home, no family, and no country.  But she uses her pains, lessons, and friendships to sing the country music she loves.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Old Dolio learned the art of the hustle from her parents, Theresa and Robert. They live in a run-down office that leaks suds once a week for $500 a month.  But they missed the last three months rent.  So, Old Dolio comes up with a plan.  They won a trip to New York, so they will fly together but pretend they don't know each other on the way back.  Theresa and Robert will pick up all three bags, and Old Dolio will declare her bag lost.  Since she insured the bag, the airport will send her a check for $1575 if they can't find it. Theresa and Robert change their plan when they meet Melanie on the flight back. Instead of Theresa and Robert picking up three bags, Theresa, Robert, and Melanie get the bags, while Old Dolio files the claim. For Melanie, they are having the Ocean's Eleven adventure she always wanted, but, to Old Dolio, Melanie is a liability.  Then, Melanie comes up with a new plan.  Often, elderly clients ask her to visit their homes.  She plans on complimenting their heirlooms and hopes they will offer it to her.  Next, she will pawn their heirlooms for money. During a heist, Old Dolio discovers the mark wants them to carry-on typical family life until he dies.  Seeing her parents act like real parents with Melanie leaves Old Dolio wanting more from them.  When Old Dolio hears Theresa call Melanie hun, Old Dolio offers Theresa all the insurance money if Theresa can call her hun too.  Theresa can't do it. It's just not them.  Melanie interjects and calls Old Dolio hun.  Melanie offers to do everything Old Dolio's parents didn't do for her if she gives Melanie the money. Old Dolio says yes, but Melanie knows Old Dolio is addicted to them.  And when they come around, Old Dolio will need another fix.  With $1575 on the line, you know they are coming back.<br/><br/>Robert and Theresa are neglectful, abusive, and heartless parents.  It's evident in all of Old Dolio's actions.  She hates to be touched, looked at, or loved by anyone.  In the first 15 minutes, you feel hopeless and sad for Old Dolio, her past, and her future.  This movie will hit a nerve for anyone who has grown up in an emotionally dysfunctional family.  Old Dolio has been a tool for her family's schemes, not their child. If you like an independent movie with a conclusion, see this one matinee.  But don't expect to laugh or cry.  Expect to leave with a better understanding of a loving family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Last Shift",
    "review":"At Oscar's Chicken and Fish in Albion, Michigan, Stanley works the night shift and does it with grace. After 38 years, Stanley is ready to leave and take care of his mother in Florida. Stanley's boss, Jasmine, told him the new employee's name is Javon.  Javon is on probation, the father of one, and doesn't have a direction in life. And he doesn't want to go to jail again, so he needs the job at Oscar's.  If he doesn't keep this job, he will go back to jail for the remainder of his sentence, 10 months.  Stanley's by the books, work at peak performance, and calm demeanor is in stark contrast with Javon's out of the box, minimal effort, and confrontational behavior.  As the two learn from each other and bond over frozen patty pucks, drunkards, and responsibilities, what will it take for them to turn on each other?  Money.<br/><br/>This movie covers a lot of topics in a short amount of time.  Topics like the wealth gap, capitalism, minimum wage, ageism, racism, white privilege, social perception, the probation system, and lying all within this short relationship.  There isn't a winner or a loser in this story, just a sad honesty. It doesn't end with flowers, song and dance, or a true conclusion. That is the hardest part to deal with when you leave the theater.  You want them to air out their feeling and resolve things with compassion or force.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Infidel",
    "review":"Doug and Liz gather their things to head to Meena's graduation party.  Meena is the daughter of Doug's co-worker Javid, who works with Doug at a software company funded by government contracts.  Liz works for the state department and creates cryptography devices.  After the party, Meena's mother calls Liz, Meena is missing. The next morning, Meena is still gone, so Liz calls the police.  Liz and Doug go to Javid's home and get the shock of their lives; the FBI is searching his house, and they labeled Javid a suspect of terrorism. Inside, Javid has terrorist paraphernalia, recruitment videos, and pictures with grenade launchers. A week later, Doug is invited to a conference to discuss his religious blog. Liz tells Doug not to go because she has a feeling something is wrong about the timing.  But Doug wants to spread his message about religious tolerance, peace, and unity.  Doug lands in Cairo, and the interview is going great.  Until Doug says, \"Jesus is God.\" There is an audible gasp in the Muslim audience, and the show abruptly ends.  Doug rushes back to his hotel, locks the door, and calls Liz.  While on the phone with Liz, Doug hears banging on his door.  Three men burst through the door and kidnap him.  The leader, Ramzi, wants Doug to continue his blog in captivity while denouncing what he said on air. The State Department leaves her dumbfounded because they won't help, but they tell her the kidnappers moved Doug to Iran. So Liz decides to head to Iran to save her husband, but she doesn't know Iran charged Doug of spying for America.<br/><br/>Once the storyline is in motion, the action picks up.  This movie feels like an extended version of 24 with family lives on the line, double agents, and betrayals.  While the action is propelling the story forward, the storyline doesn't fall flat.  It keeps the drama going for Liz and Doug.  Liz works to find Doug while determining who she can and can't trust in Iran.  Doug tries to maintain strength in his faith while being tortured, manipulated, and accused. The storyline and action are both compelling and made for the big screen, however, you won't have an urgency to buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
