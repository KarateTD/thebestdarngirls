    "review": "Cooper smiles as his daughter, Riley, dances and sings to her favorite artist, Lady Raven. As they wait in line to scan their tickets, Cooper notices officers with high-powered rifles.<br/><br/>They settle into their seats as Lady Raven performs for 20,000 people. Cooper spots police officers taking men out of the audience. Cooper enters the bathroom stall, pulls out his phone, and checks on Spencer. Spencer is the person Cooper chained in a basement. Cooper gleams as Spencer pulls his chains, cries, and begs for help.<br/><br/>During the intermission, Riley wants concert merchandise. The vendor, Jamie, loves Cooper's example. He offers to find another shirt later if Cooper returns in 10 minutes. Cooper pulls Jamie aside and asks why the arena has a vast police presence. Jamie whispers that the concert is a trap. The FBI discovered that 'The Butcher' would be there. The Butcher is a notorious serial killer who dismembered a dozen victims. They have SWAT covering every exit, FBI profiler Dr. Josephine Grant in The Butcher's head, and they will stop every man.<br/><br/>Cooper tests the security. He sees a drunken girl wobbling near a staircase. He bumps into her, and she falls. Arena security runs to her aid, but SWAT doesn't move. Cooper has to find a way out of the trap without tipping off Riley. Can he make it out?<br/><br/>This movie builds slowly for 15 minutes to allow the audience to see Cooper's bond with Riley and Riley's admiration for Lady Raven. Viewers will notice little quirks in Cooper's character before he sits with his daughter. It's not until Cooper looks at his phone that you understand the depths of his depravity. Cooper maneuvers around the arena with precision, finesse, and dumb luck. With this director, you expect a twist. However, there are several that will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you root for Cooper.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Harold and the Purple Crayon",
    "review": "Harold uses his imagination and a purple crayon to draw the world around him as a narrator dictates his actions. He wonders if he illustrated his friends, Moose and Porcupine, then who drew him. The narrator explains Harold's creator is him. He is Harold's old man. Harold wants to meet the 'old man,' but the narrator tells Harold they can't meet because he lives in the real world.<br/><br/>Harold wakes with a list of questions for the 'old man,' but he doesn't respond. He draws a door to the real world and walks through. Harold stands awed by his three-dimensional form and Moose's human body. They find older men but not theirs. So, Harold draws a bike and peddles in the middle of the street.<br/><br/>Terry drives while talking to her boss on the phone with her son, Mel, in the back seat. She reaches to recover her dropped phone, and Mel screams. Terry swerves to miss two men on a bike. They fall to the grass, and Terry's tire blows. As Terry calls roadside assistance, Harold draws her a tire that manifests. Mel sees this and remains mum. Terry allows Moose and Harold to stay in her garage apartment for the night.<br/><br/>Harold and Mel talk that night, and Harold shows Mel the magic behind his purple crayon. Harold breaks the crayon in half and gives a piece to Mel. In exchange, Mel offers to help Harold find his old man. After an exhaustive search, Harold finds a flyer for the library.<br/><br/>Mel finds the head librarian, Gary, reading excerpts from his book in a nearly empty room. Mel rolls his eyes and asks for help. Gary jokingly suggests they sky-write a message with a phone number. Harold runs outside with Mel and Moose and begins to draw. Gary looks out the window and sees Harold's plane come to life. He runs to the shelves and finds Crockett Johnson's book. Gary wants Harold's crayon and will do anything to get it.<br/><br/>Based on Harold and the Purple Crayon by Crockett Johnson, this comical movie has charming qualities while entertaining a younger audience. It glorifies the power of imagination as Harold draws a tire, skate ramp, and puma. Harold is on a quest to find his narrator but finds his purpose. He embraces other's imagination and leads with kindness. However, he is a rule breaker. This film is for Harold fans, fantastical plot lovers, and families.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Fabulous Four",
    "review": "Marilyn met Lou in their first year of college. Marilyn was the life of the party, and Lou focused on her pre-med studies. After graduation, they left and moved to New York. They met Alison, a wild child, and Kitty, a nature goddess. The four women became best friends and thought they would be together forever.<br/><br/>Recently, Marilyn moved to Key West to restart her life after her husband, John, died. Six months later, Marilyn calls Alice with exciting news. Marilyn's boyfriend, Bradley, wants to get married this weekend. And she wants Lou, Kitty, and Alice to be her bridesmaids. Alice is gleeful but knows Lou won't go because Lou and Marilyn had a falling out in New York.<br/><br/>Alice drives to Kitty's house, and they plan to trick Lou into attending. They tell Lou they entered her in a raffle for a Hemingway Cat, and she is a winner. However, they must be at Hemingway's House in Key West, Florida, to retrieve her prize. Lou boards the plane with an empty cat carrier.<br/><br/>They arrive at the AirBnB, and Marilyn bursts out the door to greet them. She stands in shocked silence when she sees Lou, and Lou mirrors Marilyn. Lou keeps her composure as they walk to the back patio. Marilyn gives Kitty and Alice a box. They open and get confetti and a message, 'Will You Be My Bridesmaid?' Lou can't believe Marilyn found a new husband so soon. John was perfect, especially since Lou was dating him first. Lou met John in college and fell in love. When Marilyn saw John, they eloped. Lou became a doctor and never found love. Can Marilyn and Lou fix their friendship when history repeats itself during this bachelorette trip?<br/><br/>This raunchy and funny movie follows women around Key West during a bachelorette excursion. These friends aren't your average grandmothers. Kitty grows cannabis and makes edibles from her plants. Alice parties and loves fast. Marilyn found a second life on TikTok. She performs for her audience daily. Lou is a successful heart surgeon, but her broken heart plagues her today. As the women walk around Key West in a haze, you may believe these are two women arguing over a dead man. However, the final act reveals so much more. That last scene saves the movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Deadpool and Wolverine",
    "review": "Wade Wilson wanted more from his life because Vanessa asked him to cut out the nonsense. He uses Cable's time-traveling device to join a superhero team, but they reject him. Wade returns to his timeline and sells cars with Peter for 6 years. Deadpool is a thing of the past. Wade bikes home and finds a surprise birthday party waiting for him. He answers a knock at the door and assumes the uniformed people are strippers. They are the Time Variant Authority or TVA. They rip the wig off Wade's head and pull him into a portal.<br/><br/>Wade wakes up at a table with Mr. Paradox at the opposite end. Mr. Paradox introduces Wade to the TVA and the Sacred Timeline. Mr. Paradox warns Wade that his timeline will end because an 'anchor being' died. He grows tired of waiting for the timelines to parish. Mr. Paradox is building a Time Ripper to destroy Wade's timeline but will allow Wade to move to another and spare his life. Wade assumes he's the anchor being, and Mr. Paradox laughs. Wade's timeline's anchor is Wolverine. Wade can't stomach the thought of losing his friends. He steals Mr. Paradox's TemPad and jumps through timelines to find a replacement Wolverine.<br/><br/>Wade returns with a suitable Logan and demands Mr. Paradox return them to his timeline. Mr. Paradox laughs because this version of Logan ended his universe. Mr. Paradox sends them to the Void. He expects Cassandra Nova and Alioth to finish the job. Wade and Logan must put their issues aside to leave the Void, stop Mr. Paradox from using the Time Ripper, and save Wade's timeline.<br/><br/>This movie reaches across universes and production studios to fulfill every fan's fantasy. The opening sequence starts with blood, guts, violation, and NSync. Then, Wade travels through the timeline and finds a host of Wolverines. They will surprise and humor you. The team-up in the Void is legendary and finishes several characters' stories while staying true to Deadpool. The graphics hold hidden gems amongst the gore and make your stomach churn with Cassandra's powers. The music covers all genres and is perfectly inappropriate. This film will surpass your expectations and remind you why you love this franchise. See this before anyone spoils the surprises. Also, there are post- and mid-credit scenes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Twisters",
    "review": "Kate, Javi, and their friends prepare Dorothy 5 for a flight. Javi adds his sensors while Kate has a super absorbent polyurethane mixture. Kate theorizes that the mixture will soak the moisture in the tornado and tame it before it can destroy property and kill people. As Javi watches with his computer, the tornado touches down while Kate and their friends attempt to exit its path. However, Kate emerges from the storm alone and scarred.<br/><br/>Kate works in New York predicting tornadoes from meteorology readings. Surprised, Kate sees Javi after five years apart. After the deadly incident, Javi moved to Miami and joined the military. He worked on state-of-the-art wind imaging equipment, and the military made a portable version. They can use the machines to create a 3D tornado image and wield the data to help others. Kate agrees to return to Oklahoma for one week to help him find the best tornado.<br/><br/>Kate meets Javi's sponsored crew, including Scott. He hands Kate the tablet and asks for directions to the nearest upcoming storm. Then, locals come to the rest stop to meet the Tornado Wrangler, Tyler. Tyler is a content creator with over one million followers. She tells him nothing about herself and gives him her prediction for the best tornado. Tyler knew Kate was lying. So, he cuts off Javi and Javi's crew. But Kate gets another hunch and follows another path. Then, Kate gets spooked. She tells Javi they are in the wrong position. He packs the vehicle and drives to another location, but they are too far, and can't triangulate with his crew. As Tyler drives past, he chastizes Javi and Kate. Kate sees the devastation, gets a renewed sense of urgency, apologizes to Javi, and wants to help. Javi smiles because his sponsor, Riggs, will be happy with more accurate data. However, Tyler warns Kate that she can't trust Riggs or Javi. Can Kate put her fears and suspicions aside to help people in Tornado Alley from suffering her fate?<br/><br/>This movie is for the big screen. It will make your breath quicken when the tornado rips through town and eats everything in its path. Unlike its predecessor, this film shows more devastation and destruction. This movie has a love triangle between Javi, Kate, and Tyler. It will be obvious who will win Kate's heart, so the romance takes a back seat to the special effects. The graphics make Twisters worthy of the big screen, but you will wait for streaming to watch it again. Also, you don't have to see the first.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
