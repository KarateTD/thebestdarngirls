    "review": "Mickey Barnes started a macaroon shop with his friend Timo. Mickey discovered that Timo had borrowed money from a local loan shark when the shop folded. The loan shark threatened to kill them if they didn't pay back his money. So, Mickey and Timo joined a group of passengers on the flight to Niflheim. The flight will leave Earth to start a new colony under the guidance of the failed politician, Kenneth Marshall, and Kenneth's adoring wife, Ylfa. Without any special skills, Mickey signs on as an Expendable.<br/><br/>Expendables are reprinted people. Niflheim scientist scan their bodies and store their memories. The technology is illegal on Earth. However, scientists can use expendables to test the atmosphere, medicine, and food on the ship and the new planet. If the person dies, the scientists will reprint them. While the technology is legal off Earth, one law remains true everywhere: no multiples. They will destroy any multiples along with their memories.<br/><br/>Mickey arrives on the ship and notices everyone fawning over Kenneth and Ylfa except Nasha. Nasha is a security officer, and they fall in love. Mickey 17 goes on an expedition into Niflheim's caverns with other explorers. They find unknown creatures and panic, causing a cave-in. Kenneth names the unknown inhabitants Creepers. Mickey falls through the ice, and Timo finds him. However, Timo leaves Mickey 17 to die because they will reprint Mickey. Mickey waits for the Creepers to eat them and pray they take big bites. However, the Creepers don't eat him and kick Mickey 17 out of the lair. Mickey 17 hitches a ride back to Niflheim and lies in his bed. He jumps when he sees Mickey 18. Mickey 17 doesn't want to kill Mickey 18, but Mickey 17 knows Kenneth will end them permanently when he discovers they are multiples. Can Mickey 17 survive before someone finds them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Mickey7 by Edward Ashton, this movie is 45 minutes too long because it changes course at the 1-hour mark. This film switches from a comedy about a man with horrific luck to a story about overthrowing a dictatorship. Then, the message changes from dictatorship to colonization. This film feels like a bait-and-switch. The saving grace is the plot's humor and the graphics. The writer finds ease in laughing at the macabre. The Mickey's onscreen interaction is seamless and doesn't distract. The cinematography is worth regular pricing, but the script is for the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Waitress Mildred Burke is a single mother who works in her mother's diner. However, Mildred never wants to be ordinary. She dreams of being a wrestler, but every state bans women in the squared circle. Mildred and her mother, Bertha, attend a wrestling match and watch Billy Wolfe win.<br/><br/>Billy and his son, G. Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie. He offers to train her the next day.<br/><br/>Mildred arrives at the carnival, and Billy and G. Bill sit outside the ring. To prove her worth, Billy has Mildred face a man. She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Witch Gray Alys uses her powers to escape death by hanging. The church enforcer, Ash, demands her soldiers find Gray Alys because she could start a revolution. Gray Alys retreats to her home and waits for customers. The Queen and her counsel, Jerais, arrive at Gray Alys's home. She wants Gray Alys to help her become a shapeshifter. Gray Alys must find a werewolf in his lair during the full moon. Then, skin it and bring the pelt to the Queen to wear. Jerais stays behind after the Queen leaves. He pays Gray Alys with a timepiece and tells her to fail the Queen. Gray Alys can't refuse.<br/><br/>Gray Alys uses her powers to enter the werewolf's mind and discovers it's living in Skull River. The people only talk of one man surviving the trek, Boyce the Hunter. She offers Boyce Jerais's timepiece if he takes her to Skull River. The catch is she must get there in 5 days.

Will Ash find Gray Alys before Gray Alys and Boyce reach Skull River?<br/><br/>Based on a short story by George R. R. Martin, this epic fantasy film contains magic and mystery but promises that it's not a fairy tale. The plot has a Shakespearean level of drama while providing several twists. The visual effects team provides a gray and red color scheme to accentuate the apocalyptic backdrop to the story. It's visually stunning and action-filled with a splash of romance. This film is a love letter to fans of this genre. It is an instant cult classic that will go over the heads of outsiders.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Last Breath",
    "review": "Chris Lemons spends time with his fianc√©e, Morag, planning paint colors for their baby's room. Morag expresses concern about Chris's job as a saturation diver, but Chris thinks it's cool. He reassures Morag that everything is okay before driving to Aberdeen Harbour. Chris greets friends on the ship and learns from fellow diver Duncan that they have a new Captain. Then, teammates tell Chris that 'Vulcan' is joining them on this dive. The divers meet with their coordinator, Craig. Craig divides the divers into four teams of three. Duncan, Chris, and the 'Vulcan' - whose name is Dave - are on team A..<br/><br/>The men spend time in the pod while the crew pressurizes it to prepare for their dive. After some time, each team makes the dive in their pod. They will take turns repairing the gas pipeline. They dive, and Craig chooses Team A to go to the subsea manifold first. Chris and Dave will dive while Duncan monitors their umbilical cables and air levels from above. Duncan opens the hatch, and the water rushes inside. He knows it's a sign of a 20-foot swell above. Craig confirms Duncan's suspicions, but the team continues.<br/><br/>While Chris and Dave work on the manifold, they don't know what's happening above until the umbilical cable retracts without Duncan's assistance. The thrusters on the ship failed, and the vessel, connected to their pod, drifts further into the sea. Dave and Chris climb the manifold as the ship pulls. Then, Chris's umbilical cable snags on the manifold. Duncan warns Chris that his cable will snap under the strain. Knowing that the vessel will pull him before he can help Chris, Dave tells Chris to climb the manifold after the cable breaks. He can't save Chris if he can't find him. His cable breaks. Chris falls, and the ship pulls Dave away. Dave rejoins a somber Duncan. They can't rescue Chris until the vessel stops drifting. Chris has 10 minutes of air before he dies. Can the vessel's crew stop the drift so Dave and Duncan can return to save Chris?<br/><br/>Based on the Last Breath documentary, this movie only gives the audience a brief moment to understand the characters and their work. However, it's enough to have you waiting with bated breath as they count down Chris's air supply. Your heart will drop when the countdown changes from time with air to time without it. The camera work doesn't make you the diver but turns you into a fish in the ocean. You swim around the divers while they work and struggle. This film will take you through a roller coaster of emotions without crass humor. This film is a must-see in theaters.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
