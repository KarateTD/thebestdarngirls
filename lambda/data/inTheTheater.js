    "review":"Manny worked odd jobs in LA in 1926. He got an elephant to studio executive Don Wallach's party and helped keep tabs on attendees. Manny's boss tells him to ignore Elinor St. John because she is a gossip journalist. Sidney Palmer plays the trumpet with his band while avoiding the depravity around him. Lady Fay Zhu performs a song and picks a beautiful woman in the audience to kiss. Manny takes a smoke break and sees a woman, Nellie, crash into a statue. Manny pretends to know Nellie and sneaks her into the mansion. Someone pulls Manny aside because a woman, Jane Thorton, overdosed, and they want to get her out without the other partygoers knowing. Manny's boss remembers that Jane has to be on the movie set at 8 am. There is no way Jane will be ready on time, so the boss runs to the ballroom, spots Nellie wildly dancing, and chooses Nellie to replace Jane. Outside, actor Jack Conrad gets into an argument with his wife, and she leaves him at the mansion. Jack walks in and orders every alcohol on the menu.<br/><br/>Manny wakes up in a mansion filled with trash and unconscious bodies. His boss tells him to take Jack home because he is too drunk to drive. After getting Jack comfortable, Jack hires Manny to be his assistant on set, and Manny accepts. He returns to the mansion to find Nellie leaving in the stolen car she crashed the night before. He declares his love for her, and Nellie drives away to her first acting gig. Hollywood will bring out the best and worst in all, but one change will redirect the course of their careers: sound in movies.<br/><br/>Most viewers today don't understand the complexity of making a silent film. This movie shows every step of filming, lighting, stunts, and painting words for the screen. Next, the audience will see Hollywood's difficulties after pivoting to talking films. This movie spends most of its time tearing Hollywood apart, but the last 5 minutes are a love letter to everything it accomplished. While the movie is fun, it's far too long. The editor could cut an hour out of the film and tell the same story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody",
    "review":"Whitney Houston sings in the church choir led by her mother, Cissy Houston. She tells Whitney to sing all the words accurately, learn the melody, and use her head, heart, and gut. On stage, Cissy and Whitney are perfect, but off stage, Whitney hides from her parents' arguments. She and her brothers do drugs to escape the yelling matches.<br/><br/>One night, Cissy looks at the crowd and sees Clive Davis in the audience. She pretends to lose her voice and demands Whitney sing in her place. Whitney blows Clive away, and he believes Whitney is the voice of a generation. Clive wants to sign Whitney to a record deal immediately and invites her to his office. Cissy wants Whitney to sign without pause, but her father, John, wants Whitney to think twice. Whitney signs. In the elevator, her parents tell her that she needs to be America's princess to succeed in the business. This contract is the first step in the rise and fall of Whitney Houston.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't offer any new information about Whitney Houston. However, it gives viewers an insight into her relationship with Robyn and Clive Davis. If you are looking for more Whitney and Bobby gossip, watch the Lifetime movie. The actors do a magnificent job of re-enacting her videos, performances, and on-stage flare. But you will leave with the feeling of attending a Whitney concert with behind-the-scenes footage. And nothing more.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish",
    "review":"Puss In Boots throws a party in the governor's mansion and invites the town without the governor's knowledge. Puss attempts to escape when the governor returns, but his party wakes a giant monster. Sadly, the bell Puss used to defeat the giant fell on Puss, killing him. Puss wakes with a veterinarian examining him. He tells Puss that he's run out of lives and needs to retire from adventures. The veterinarian gives Puss the address for Mama Luna's Cat Rescue. Puss goes to a bar to drink his cares away when a wolf sits next to him. Puss is fearless until the wolf draws blood. Puss's life flashes before his eyes, and he runs away. He buries his signature garb and retreats to Mama Luna's.<br/><br/>Puss slowly adjust to life as a house cat named Pickles and finds a dog hiding their. One day, Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family come to Mama Luna looking for Puss. They find his buried clothing on the property and assume Puss died. Puss overhears them talking about stealing a map to the falling star and can't believe it. The falling star can grant one last wish, and Puss desires the map to find the star. He wants to wish for nine more lives.<br/><br/>Two thieves stole the map for Big Jack Horner. He collects magical relics for his private display.

Puss doesn't know that Jack, Goldi, the Bears, and the wolf are hot on their trail.<br/><br/>This sequel incorporates excellent animation with fantastic storytelling. It's unnecessary to see the first film or the Shrek movies to understand Puss In Boots. This movie expands on the legend of Puss and introduces new characters with ease. As you watch, notice each time they take a shot at Disney and Pixar movies while acknowledging Mary Poppins and Terminator. This film is excellent for the whole family while teaching an appreciation lesson to children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Avatar: The Way of the Water",
    "review":"It's been ten years since the Na'vi kicked humans off Omaticaya, but a few stayed. Dr. Norm and Dr. Max remained because they sided with the Na'vi and continued their studies. The humans left Spider behind because he was too young to go into cryostasis. He is the son of Colonel Miles and loves to be in the Pandora rainforest with Jake and his family instead of other humans. Jake and Neytiri have four children, Neteyam, Kiri, Lo'ak, and Tuk.<br/><br/>During date night, Jake and Neytiri notice an extra star in the sky. The humans are back. They create a massive fireball to destroy several habitats. However, Jake prepared the Na'vi, and they are battle ready. Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak go to Jake and Miles's last battle site. They find Na'vi in full camouflage and guns. The humans cloned Na'vi bodies and implanted a person's personality and memories in the bodies. Now, Colonel Miles is a walking Na'vi Trojan horse.<br/><br/>After a standoff between Jake and Miles, Miles takes Spider, and Jake runs with his kids. Staying will bring more devastation to her people, so they must leave their life behind. Jake and his family travel to the water and meet with Tonowari. He leads the reef people of Metkayina with his wife, Ronal, by his side. Jake and his family must learn the way of the water to survive on the reef. And they need to study it quickly. Cloning Na'vi isn't the only thing humans desire. However, Miles's need for revenge is his driving force to hunt Jake and his entire family with a captive Spider assisting.<br/><br/>The sequel to Avatar expands the cinematic world by introducing the reef people. Viewers get new animals, plant life, and customs in this new environment. This movie has a lengthy running time, but it doesn't feel 3 hours long. The audience is so immersed in the scenes and culture that you don't mind. The animators did a magnificent job blending real people with motion-capture characters. The moment Tonowari and Ronal discuss Jake and his family staying is the best-animated scene, and it had zero words. Tonowari and Ronal give each other stern looks, loving eyes, and a plea. You will laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer throughout the movie. This film goes beyond what fans expect and is worth the 13-year wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Violent Night",
    "review":"Santa Claus stops at a bar in England and drinks before delivering presents to nice boys and girls. But people's growing greed and selfishness leave Santa jaded about the holidays. He gets in his sleigh and heads into the night.<br/><br/>In Connecticut, Jason waits for his estranged wife, Linda, and their daughter, Trudy, with a gift for his mother, Gertrude. Trudy admits she's sad because Jason didn't take her to see Santa and make her Christmas wish. They arrive at Gertrude's massive estate, and Jason's sister, Alva, is there with her son, Bert, and boyfriend, Morgan. Alva accuses Jason of sucking up to Gertrude for the business, but Jason ignores her.<br/><br/>Later that night, Jason still feels guilty for Trudy missing Santa. So he wraps up a walkie-talkie with earbuds and gives it to her. He tells Trudy it's a magic walkie-talkie that can communicate directly with Santa. As Trudy sleeps, the adults argue about the company, Christmas gifts, and money. They don't notice the catering staff has guns and kills security. A man called Scrooge enters and demands cash from Gertrude. Sources told Scrooge that Gertrude stole $300,000,000 from the government and hid it in a vault on the property. Until they get the money, Scrooge and his accomplices will hold the family hostage.<br/><br/>Upstairs, Santa eats cookies, drinks Bourbon, and sits in a massage chair. He hears the commotion downstairs and tries to escape. However, his magic isn't working. Frosty, a henchman, spots Santa and gets into a bloody battle. As Santa looks for another way to escape, he hears a sound coming from the closet. He finds the other walkie-talkie and answers Trudy. She tells Santa she's in danger and begs for help. Santa checks his scroll and sees she's on the nice list. He tells Trudy not to worry because Santa is coming to town.<br/><br/>So what if Bad Santa, John Wick, and Kevin McCallister worked together to stop the murderous Wet Bandits? Well, watch this movie and find out. The audience knows this is the real Santa at the beginning, but he has issues. And his skull-crushing origin story tells the darkness behind the red suit. This movie isn't for the faint of heart. It's for the Die Hard Christmas fans that want to break out of the Christmas rom-com rut. The fight scenes are stellar, and the Christmas magic isn't sappy or cliché. Step away from the ordinary and have a blood-and-guts Christmas.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
