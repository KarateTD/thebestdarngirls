    "review":"Michael Morbius created another origami animal as Dr. Nicholas walked into the room with a new patient, Lucien.  Michael calls him Milo, like all the other ones before him.  They live in a hospital for children with unique blood disorders.  They need to have their blood cleaned three times a day.  During an 'oil change,' Milo's machine stops working, and he passes out.  He opens Milo's pump and fixes it with a pen spring.  Dr. Nicholas believes Michael is a genius and wants Michael to apply to a gifted school.  Michael says yes.  Today, Michael won a Nobel Peace Prize for creating artificial blood.  But he turned it down.  While the blood benefitted so many, it failed to cure his ailment.  However, Michael believes he has a new solution: vampire bats.  He tells his colleague, Dr. Martine, that he wants to mix animal DNA with human DNA.  Michael is ready for human trials, but he knows it's illegal.  So Michael goes to Milo for ship funding to conduct his experiments on international waters.  Milo gives Michael anything and everything that he needs.<br/><br/>On the ship, Michael finds the right mixture.  He asks Martine to inject the serum into his spine.  A guard comes into the room and starts to harass Martine.  She verbally condemns the guard but realizes Michael is gone.  She enters the room with the guard and sees Michael on the ceiling.  The guard shoots, but Michael dodges the bullets and attacks.  After killing several men and drinking their blood, Michael finds Martine unconscious.  He covers her up, calls mayday, and jumps off the ship.  FBI agents, Rodriguez and Stroud, haven't seen a case like this since San Francisco.<br/><br/>Back at Horizon, Michael goes to his lab and tests his new abilities.  He can fly, has increased strength, and can use echolocation, but there is a downfall.  Michael desires human blood every 6 hours.  He tried to use artificial blood.  As his body adapts, Michael needs the fake blood more often.  When Milo sees Michael healthy, he thinks Michael has a cure.  Milo begs, but Michael refuses to give it to him because he doesn't want Milo to become a monster.<br/><br/>When Michael awakes, he hears the staff saying an orderly exsanguinated and died.  Michael can't remember if he did it, so he attempts to leave.  Stroud confronts Michael.  Although Michael could run away, he refuses because he believes he hurt the orderly.<br/><br/>In jail, the guard tells Michael his lawyer is there for a visit.  Michael sees Milo walk through the doors and smiles.  Michael explains everything, and Milo believes Michael is innocent.  Milo leaves and promises to come back.  Michael finds a blood bag and Milo's cane after Milo walks out of the cell.  Michael knows that Milo stole his serum, took it, and faked his illness in the cell.  Now, Micheal has to become Morbius, find a fix, and stop Milo before Milo kills more innocent people.<br/><br/>This origin story gives viewers the same feeling as the Eternals.  The plot fully introduces you to a new character in the MCU, but you didn't get much else.  The graphic designers took dramatic risks to help viewers experience Morbius's echolocation and flying powers.  This risk will translate well in future films.  Also, the director used old-school horror movie tactics to depict the murder scenes.  You never see the killing.  Just aggressive hand movements and blood.  Of course, you need to stick around because there are two end credit scenes.  This film is essential for the next phase.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Lost City",
    "review":"Beth calls Loretta Sage multiple times for the final chapter of The Lost City of D..  It's a 20-book franchise featuring the romantic adventures of Dash and Dr. Lovemore.  Beth knows writing became complicated after Loretta's husband, John, died.  Loretta used her love of dead languages and John's archeology exploits to add authenticity to her novels.<br/><br/>Before Loretta's Q and A, Beth tells Loretta to relax, don't be boring, and don't use big words.  Then Beth drops a surprise.  Alan will join Loretta for the Q and A and the upcoming book tour.  Alan portrays Dash on the cover art for Loretta's books, and he dons a wig and takes off his shirt for fans.  Loretta tells Beth that she plans to kill Dash and end the series.  Alan follows Loretta because he wants to know why and how Loretta will kill his character.  When she doesn't give Alan an answer, he snaps and calls her a human mummy.  Alan feels guilty about his insult and goes after Loretta.  When he walks out of the hotel, he sees Loretta trying to get out of a black SUV with three men inside.<br/><br/>Abigail Fairfax is an eccentric billionaire who wants to prove his worth by finding the crown of blood.  He has a section of a scroll with markings, and he wants Loretta to translate it.  He found the actual lost city and bought the island.  He will keep Loretta until she translates the scroll and guides him to the crown.<br/><br/>When Beth and Alan discover Loretta is gone, Alan calls Jack.  Jack is a trainer and CIA agent.  Beth sends Loretta's position to Jack, and he promises to find Loretta.  But Alan doesn't want to wait.  So, Alan joins Jack on Jack's mission to rescue Loretta.  Alan hopes to convince Loretta that he is more than a pretty face.<br/><br/>During their mission, Jack and Alan find Loretta.  Before they pull Loretta away, Loretta steals Abigail's scroll.  When Abigail notices the missing artifact, he sends his henchmen to find Loretta, get the scroll, and kill her friends.  Can they escape the jungle with the crown, or will they fall prey to Abigail's desires?<br/><br/>This film is an action-adventure film with a Hallmark movie in between.  However, it provides lots of underhanded jokes and sly comments.  Loretta and Alan have great on-screen chemistry.  However, Loretta has to learn that she judges Alan quickly and harshly.  And she spills this resentment on to her fans.  This movie is an easy watch, but you need to pay attention to get all the jokes.  And stay for the first set of end credits to get a wanted return.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars",

    "mtitle":"The Batman",
    "review":"It's Halloween.  And while most of Gotham celebrate candy and debauchery, Bruce Wayne uses his mask for vengeance against the city's underbelly.  Batman has looked over the citizens with Lieutenant Gordon and his signal for two years.  Someone killed mayor Don Mitchell, wrapped his head in tape, cut off his thumb, and wrote 'No More Lies' on him.  The killer, The Riddler, left a card for 'The Batman' with a cipher inside.  The Riddler vows to kill more people and unmask the corruption in Gotham.  Batman uncovers pictures of the mayor with a young woman, that is not his wife, coming out of the Iceberg Lounge.<br/><br/>During questioning, a waitress walks into the room.  She freezes when she sees the photos.  The waitress goes to her apartment that she shares with the young woman, Annika, from the images.  The waitress promises to help Annika getaway.  After changing clothes, the waitress gingerly leaves the apartment through a window.  She goes to the mayor's home, an active crime scene, finds a hidden safe and cracks it.  She pulls out Annika's stolen passport when Batman grabs her.  The waitress is Selina Kyle, Catwoman.  Batman worries about the cat burglar and follows Selina back to her apartment.  Annika and their phones are gone.  Selina tells Batman that she will find answers in the 44 Below Club.  It's a private club within the Iceberg Lounge where the crooked politicians and cops hang out.  Batman knows this will be a target-rich environment for the Riddler, so he devises a plan for him and Selina to work together.  In 7 days, Batman will learn that his mask can inspire hope, create resentment, and reveal dark aspirations.  And all roads lead to Arkham.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best Batman movies since The Dark Knight.  It provides action, mystery, a few jump-scares, and intensely emotional moments.  This movie assumes you know Batman's backstory.  While the story and acting were impressive, the running time made the movie drag.  Don't be surprised if you wonder 'is this the end' several times.  The end credits will tempt you to stay, but there are zero spoilers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Fifteen years ago, Nate and his brother, Sam, tried to steal Magellan's map.  It was the first map of the world with a secret to where Magellan and his crew hid billions in gold.  A security guard catches them and turns them over to the nuns at the orphanage.  This is Sam's third strike, and he must leave the orphanage to meet with a judge.  Sam goes upstairs to get his things, and Nate follows.  Nate sees Sam about to escape, and Nate begs him not to leave him.  Sam gives Nate a ring, a lighter, a letter, and a promise to return.<br/><br/>Today, Nate is a bartender with a lot of historical knowledge and sticky fingers.  He lifts a bracelet from a customer when a man, Sully, gives him praise.  Nate refuses to work with Sully, and Sully leaves.  Nate checks his pockets, and Sully's business card is in the bracelet's place.  Nate breaks into Sully's home and finds Sully waiting for him.  Sully notices that Nate stopped at the map on the wall before looking for the bracelet.  Then, Sully tells Nate the map is authentic, like the treasure.  To get it, they need two crosses because they're the key.  Sully already has one, but the other will be in an auction.  Nate doesn't want to be a part of the plan, but Sully mentions Sam.  Sully thinks that finding the treasure will lead to Sam.  Nate will quickly learn that there is no honor among thieves.<br/><br/>Based on Uncharted for Playstation, this movie is how game adaptations should be from this point forward.  It was funny, captivating, and suspenseful.  This film was Indiana Jones and National Treasure with a bit of Goonies.  It's no surprise that the mid-credits scene gives sequel hints.  Some action sequences feel like watching a high-resolution video game.  The film never gets slow or bogged down with unnecessary love stories.  Enjoy this adaption on the big screen for maximum viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jackson Briggs works in a gas station's sandwich shop while waiting to hear about his diplomat security application.  Jackson suffered a traumatic brain injury that may result in headaches, blurred vision, and seizures.  Although he got a clean bill of health, Jackson can't connect with Commander Jones on the phone to confirm his work detail.  He gets a call from Jones with unfortunate information that his fellow ranger, Riley, died.  Jackson goes to a local pub to celebrate Riley's life, drink, and talk to someone in charge.  Jones accuses Jackson of buying his medical clearance and drives away.<br/><br/>In the morning, Jones finds Jackson, grabs Jackson by the ankles, and pulls Jackson out of his truck.  Jones tells Jackson to come to Fort Lewis for a mission.  If Jackson completes it, Jones will approve Jackson's application.  Riley's family wants his K-9, LuLu, to attend his funeral.  Jackson remembers LuLu as a badass that loved Grey's Anatomy.  He steps into the cage to pet a muzzled LuLu.  At first, LuLu is calm.  Then, Jackson touches her ears, and she snaps.  This behavior makes LuLu a poor candidate for adoption.  So after the funeral, the military will put LuLu down.  Jackson gets LuLu into the car and starts the 1500 mile journey to Riley's funeral and LuLu's death.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a veteran pushing to get back into duty.  LuLu is a mirror for Jackson's inner turmoil.  She has extreme anxiety, which causes her to pant heavily.  As Jackson accepts LuLu's trials and tribulations, he forgives his own.  The director wonderfully shot moments between Jackson and LuLu to convey all possible emotions.  Enjoy this movie about a veteran and a handler.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
