    "mtitle": "Deadpool and Wolverine",
    "review": "Wade Wilson wanted more from his life because Vanessa asked him to cut out the nonsense. He uses Cable's time-traveling device to join a superhero team, but they reject him. Wade returns to his timeline and sells cars with Peter for 6 years. Deadpool is a thing of the past. Wade bikes home and finds a surprise birthday party waiting for him. He answers a knock at the door and assumes the uniformed people are strippers. They are the Time Variant Authority or TVA. They rip the wig off Wade's head and pull him into a portal.<br/><br/>Wade wakes up at a table with Mr. Paradox at the opposite end. Mr. Paradox introduces Wade to the TVA and the Sacred Timeline. Mr. Paradox warns Wade that his timeline will end because an 'anchor being' died. He grows tired of waiting for the timelines to parish. Mr. Paradox is building a Time Ripper to destroy Wade's timeline but will allow Wade to move to another and spare his life. Wade assumes he's the anchor being, and Mr. Paradox laughs. Wade's timeline's anchor is Wolverine. Wade can't stomach the thought of losing his friends. He steals Mr. Paradox's TemPad and jumps through timelines to find a replacement Wolverine.<br/><br/>Wade returns with a suitable Logan and demands Mr. Paradox return them to his timeline. Mr. Paradox laughs because this version of Logan ended his universe. Mr. Paradox sends them to the Void. He expects Cassandra Nova and Alioth to finish the job. Wade and Logan must put their issues aside to leave the Void, stop Mr. Paradox from using the Time Ripper, and save Wade's timeline.<br/><br/>This movie reaches across universes and production studios to fulfill every fan's fantasy. The opening sequence starts with blood, guts, violation, and NSync. Then, Wade travels through the timeline and finds a host of Wolverines. They will surprise and humor you. The team-up in the Void is legendary and finishes several characters' stories while staying true to Deadpool. The graphics hold hidden gems amongst the gore and make your stomach churn with Cassandra's powers. The music covers all genres and is perfectly inappropriate. This film will surpass your expectations and remind you why you love this franchise. See this before anyone spoils the surprises. Also, there are post- and mid-credit scenes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Kate, Javi, and their friends prepare Dorothy 5 for a flight. Javi adds his sensors while Kate has a super absorbent polyurethane mixture. Kate theorizes that the mixture will soak the moisture in the tornado and tame it before it can destroy property and kill people. As Javi watches with his computer, the tornado touches down while Kate and their friends attempt to exit its path. However, Kate emerges from the storm alone and scarred.<br/><br/>Kate works in New York predicting tornadoes from meteorology readings. Surprised, Kate sees Javi after five years apart. After the deadly incident, Javi moved to Miami and joined the military. He worked on state-of-the-art wind imaging equipment, and the military made a portable version. They can use the machines to create a 3D tornado image and wield the data to help others. Kate agrees to return to Oklahoma for one week to help him find the best tornado.<br/><br/>Kate meets Javi's sponsored crew, including Scott. He hands Kate the tablet and asks for directions to the nearest upcoming storm. Then, locals come to the rest stop to meet the Tornado Wrangler, Tyler. Tyler is a content creator with over one million followers. She tells him nothing about herself and gives him her prediction for the best tornado. Tyler knew Kate was lying. So, he cuts off Javi and Javi's crew. But Kate gets another hunch and follows another path. Then, Kate gets spooked. She tells Javi they are in the wrong position. He packs the vehicle and drives to another location, but they are too far, and can't triangulate with his crew. As Tyler drives past, he chastizes Javi and Kate. Kate sees the devastation, gets a renewed sense of urgency, apologizes to Javi, and wants to help. Javi smiles because his sponsor, Riggs, will be happy with more accurate data. However, Tyler warns Kate that she can't trust Riggs or Javi. Can Kate put her fears and suspicions aside to help people in Tornado Alley from suffering her fate?<br/><br/>This movie is for the big screen. It will make your breath quicken when the tornado rips through town and eats everything in its path. Unlike its predecessor, this film shows more devastation and destruction. This movie has a love triangle between Javi, Kate, and Tyler. It will be obvious who will win Kate's heart, so the romance takes a back seat to the special effects. The graphics make Twisters worthy of the big screen, but you will wait for streaming to watch it again. Also, you don't have to see the first.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot",
    "review": "First Lady Donna Martin is happy with her family in the small town of Possum Trot. Her husband, Reverand W.C. Martin, leads the Bennett Baptist Church. They have two children, Ladonna and Princeton. However, Donna's mother, Murtha, wants Donna and W.C. to have more children. Murtha, the mother of 18, returns home and dies. Donna falls into a depression for months. After arguing with W.C., Donna leaves the house and travels to the ruins of her childhood home. There, she sees a group of children playing and hears God speak to her. Donna calls her sister, Diann, and asks Diann to attend an adoption seminar.<br/><br/>Social worker Susan explains that 70% of the children suffer from poverty-induced neglect. The other 30% suffered severe abuse. She shows Diann and Donna images of the other 30%, and the pictures call both to act.<br/><br/>A brother and sister come to Susan's office with heartbreaking stories. Susan exhausts all her options. Donna jumps at the chance to help and welcomes them into her home. W.C. preaches to their congregation about their adoption, the excuses not to adopt, and the bible's most notable adoption. It inspires 22 families to adopt. However, the people can't afford to come to Susan for the classes. They ask Susan to host it in their church. This small town will make a lasting imprint on the children, Texas, and the system, but it won't be easy.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't make adoption look effortless. However, the families in Possum Trot never give up. The writers don't depict adoption as a magic bullet to fix these children's long-term hardships. It's the first step of many. When W.C. and Donna see the town falling apart and second-guessing their choice, they lean on each other with group prayer and outreach. They recap the children and townspeople today at the conclusion before asking the audience to help. It will assist viewers make an informed choice about adoption. But hopefully, it will spark a passion for others to follow Possum Trot's lead.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Despicable Me 4",
    "review": "Gru and 3 of his minions attend Gru's high school reunion at Lyc√©e Pas Bon, School of Villainy. Gru isn't there to meet old friends. He is working undercover for the Anti-Villain League to catch Maxime Le Mal. Maxime reminds his former classmates about his affinity for cockroaches. He admires them so much he turns himself into a hybrid: half man, half roach. Gru gives the secret phrase, and the AVL runs in, fights, and captures Maxime.<br/><br/>Gru spends time with his wife, Lucy, and daughters - Margot, Agnes, and Edith. However, the newest addition, Gru Jr., maintains an icy demeanor around his father. The family plans for the day when they get a visit from Silas Ramsbottom. Silas warns Gru that Maxime vowed vengeance against Gru before escaping prison. The AVL wants Gru and his family to move to a safe house in Mayflower until they catch Maxime.<br/><br/>Gru and Lucy want to help the girls settle into their new lives, but Margot and Agnes face difficulties. Gru tries to start a conversation between the neighbor's daughter, Poppy, and Margot, but Poppy ignores them. Later, Poppy tells Gru she knows his real identity and will expose him if Gru doesn't help her. Gru must help Poppy to keep his away from Maxime's clutches. Can he do it?<br/><br/>The fourth film in the Despicable Me franchise leans on slapstick humor to entertain the audience. Gru Jr. is the only character with growth in this installment. This movie is about Gru saving Gru Jr. and gaining Gru Jr.'s trust. Viewers will laugh because Gru Jr. is as devious as his father and delights in irritating him. Gru doesn't think his son loves him, but Gru Jr. is his father's son. The final song offers easter eggs for Minions and prequel fans. Also, the film doesn't have post- or mid-credit scenes. This movie won't be your favorite, but your kids will laugh.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Inside Out 2",
    "review": "Over the years, Riley became an excellent student, strong hockey player, animal lover, and caring friend. Her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - continue to share her core memories and store them in long-term storage. The vital memories form her beliefs. Each belief creates Riley's belief system and her sense of self, the newest section of her mind. Joy will do anything to protect the latest system.<br/><br/>Riley celebrates with her best friends Grace and Bree as the coach of the Fire Hawks, Coach Roberts, approaches them after winning a game. She wants them to come to her hockey camp to train. Her favorite player, Val, is on the team. Val started her first year and is a legend among high school players. Grace, Bree, and Riley accept the invitation.<br/><br/>Riley goes to bed the night before camp and dreams of meeting Val and practicing with her friends. As Riley turns in for the night, her emotions do the same. A beeping awakes Joy in the middle of the night. She and the other emotions walk over to the console and see the puberty light gently flashing. Then, it blares. The demo team rips out the console and updates it for the new guys, but Riley wakes up before they finish.<br/><br/>Riley's mother, Mrs. Andersen, enters Riley's room and expresses her surprise that Riley isn't ready for camp. Her emotions touch the console, and Riley cries, yells, and collapses in bed. They find a new emotion touching it. Anxiety introduces Riley's emotions to Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment.<br/><br/>The Andersens give Riley and her friends a ride to camp. Riley talks about their future together when Disgust notices a look on Bree's face. Grace feels the tension and blurts out that she and Bree will attend a different high school. Riley maintains her composure until her parents drive away. Val notices Riley's sadness, talks to her, and invites Riley to sit with her team. Anxiety takes over and defuses the situation by predicting possible outcomes and changes Riley's personality to give Riley the best conclusion. Joy tries to help, but her attempts make Riley look silly. Anxiety tells Embarrassment to grab Riley's old emotions after Joy makes another mistake. Anxiety tells the mind police to take them to Riley's Dark Secrets Vault. Then, Anxiety disconnects Riley's Sense of Self and sends it to the back of Riley's mind. They will use her new memories with second-generation emotions to build a new Riley. Can Riley's first-generation emotions return to Riley's mind before Anxiety takes over?<br/><br/>Riley and her emotions did it again. They cause the audience to laugh, cringe, cry, and breathe a sigh of relief. The writers added new sections of Riley's mind while taking fans through familiar territory. Riley breaks the rules, disregards her friends, and forces herself to practice when her other emotions are at the helm. Riley loses her Sense of Self for popularity. The movie explains how Anxiety works, helps, and harms people in a lovingly gentle way. The conclusion profoundly affects adults and teaches kids the value of emotions. You should see this movie in theaters today.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
