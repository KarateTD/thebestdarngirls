    "review":"Pilot Mills, from Planet Somaris, embarks on a 2-year exploratory mission in space. Typically, his missions last six weeks, but his daughter, Nevine, is ill, and this mission pays three times his salary. During the mission, Mills wakes up to sirens blaring because debris from a meteorite hit the ship, and the aircraft goes into manual mode. Mills crash lands on an unknown planet and assesses the damage. Everyone in cryosleep died, and several escape pods got damaged except for 2, which are missing. He decides to end his life but thinks about Nevine. Then, his detection device picks up a distress beacon from a cryopod. He finds a young girl, Koa, alive inside the pod, but it's failing. He walks Koa to his aircraft and notices a massively large footprint. He sees a reflection of light in the distance. His device says it's one of the missing escape pods, and the pod is 15 kilometers away.. Mills wants to take Koa to the escape pod and coordinate a rendezvous point for a rescue crew to find him. Mills doesn't know that the unknown planet is Earth - 65 million years ago.<br/><br/>Mills is a man facing an unfathomable situation. He is on a planet he doesn't know, with a kid who speaks a different language, and dinosaurs surround him. They deal with tar pits, quicksand, cave-ins, and a dislocated shoulder. The plot doesn't have unnecessary love stories, drama, or altruistic speeches. It's 15 minutes of setup followed by action. The director made a risky choice to display a portion of a fight scene between Mills and a dinosaur on the handheld device. Viewers got a 3D pixelated fight that amps the suspense. The plot reveals two other secrets: Mills's reason for wanting to end his life and a ticking clock. You may not want to buy this movie, but it's worth the price of admission and a few jump scares.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Nathan gets a call from his superior. Thieves broke into a lab in Johannesburg and stole something worth $10 billion. However, they don't know what the thieves stole, but they call it 'The Handle.' Nathan must create a team and uncover the buyer, seller, and what the thieves stole. The fallout will be catastrophic if The Handle falls into the wrong hands. Nathan knows the best person for the job: Orson Fortune.<br/><br/>Nathan goes to Morocco to convince Orson to take the job. Nathan hired J.J. and Sarah. J.J. can do, fire, and drive anything. Sarah is a tech-savvy con artist. Orson asks if John is coming. Sadly, Mike, the leader of another team, poached John from Nathan. Nathan collected intel that the deal's broker is Greg, but Greg keeps the seller and the buyer apart. Greg's courier will bring the item to Madrid and give it to Greg.<br/><br/>Orson, Sarah, and J.J. cover the airport and spot the courier with an alligator case. However, something is off. Orson realizes someone is working their job at the airport. They grab the courier and the briefcase and pull them into a van. They open the case and find an encrypted hard drive. Sarah starts to clone it when the courier has a heart attack. He tells him where to meet Greg. If they don't deliver the drive, Greg will kill the courier's wife. The man dies, but Orson sees the second team. It's Mike's team.<br/><br/>Now, they are in a race to get to Greg. Luckily for them, Greg has a fascination with celebrities. And his favorite is Danny Francesco. Sarah discovers that Greg is having a charity auction on a boat. With Danny by their side, they will get an invite. They have to convince Danny to go. Then, they can find the buyer and seller, return the drive to their government, and save the world.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is a master's class in sound engineering because the action flows on beat with Nathan's footsteps down the hall. In Guy Ritchie form, the cast of characters gets a quick introduction and background. Then, you get steeped into a sexy and funny mystery with guns, explosions, and terrorists. This strategy worked for The Gentleman, but it falls incredibly flat here. This film follows this director's formula but is dull, unamusing, and unimaginative. This movie is for Netflix, not the big screen.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cocaine Bear",
    "review":"Andrew C. Thorton the second drops bags of cocaine from a plane onto the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in 1985. Andrew straps the final duffle to his harness and prepares to jump out of the plane. However, Andrew knocks himself unconscious on the airplane's door and dies. Knoxville resident, Fred Myers, finds Andrew's body and alerts the police. Detective Bob discovers Andrew works for Missouri dealer Syd and summarizes there are more drugs around the area.<br/><br/>Syd calls Daveed to the local restaurant. Syd wants Daveed to find his missing cocaine and take his son, Eddie, with him. And Syd must get the drugs back before the Columbians start asking questions. Daveed locates Eddie at a bar and convinces him to come to the forest to find the cocaine.<br/><br/>Sari informs her daughter, Dee Dee, that they won't paint the falls this weekend. Once Sari leaves, Dee Dee's friend, Henry, comes to the house. Dee Dee has a new plan. They will skip school and go to the forest so she can paint the falls without Sari. The school calls Sari, and she returns home and finds Henry's backpack. Inside, Sari finds a map of the falls and heads to the forest after them.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to anyone, a black bear found several kilos of drugs and ate them. Now, an apex predator is high on cocaine, and Dee Dee, Henry, Sari, Eddie, Daveed, and Bob are all headed in its direction. This doped bear will leave a trail of blood, guts, bones, and drool that no one will forget.<br/><br/>Viewers must prepare to laugh from beginning to end with amusing jump scares. While the plot is nothing like the real story, it uses the legend as its premise. Parents should understand this film is not for young kids. The editor added real news clips to the movie to bring you back to the period with the 'Say No To Drugs' and 'This is Your Brain On Drugs' campaigns. It also includes the report of Fred finding the body. Of course, the bear isn't flawless CGI, but that helps viewers see the movie as a comedy instead of pure horror. See this movie in theaters if you need a good laugh with your jump scare. And it has two post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Pastor Chuck Smith and his wife, Kay, sit on the couch and listen to news reports about hippies. He thinks they need a bath, but their daughter, Janette, believes her father should be more open-minded since his church has a handful of members. Janette drives and sees a hitchhiker, Lonnie, with Jesus painted on his cape. Janette talks to Lonnie and demands Lonnie talk to Chuck. Janette convinces her father to give the hippie a chance, and Lonnie persuades him. He describes hippies as sheep without a shepherd, but they seek the basic principles of the bible. Chuck invites Lonnie to speak at his church.<br/><br/>Greg attends military school and likes to draw and take photos. After school, Greg goes to a park and takes pictures of a pretty girl, Cathe. She calls Greg a square, but he wants to prove he's not. So she invites him to The Happening, and he attends. After one weekend with Cathe, Greg leaves his school behind and follows her into the hippie lifestyle. However, Cathe changes when her sister almost overdoses on drugs. Cathe attends Calvary Church because she heard about the new preacher Lonnie welcoming hippies with a new inclusive message. Greg leaves Cathe behind until he almost dies in a car accident while high on drugs. Lonnie asks Greg to come to Calvary, and he does. However, Greg leaves because he worries religion will be his next high. Cathe assures Greg it will be different, and they walk back inside. These three men will start the Jesus Revolution, but can the church withstand the persecution?<br/><br/>Based on Jesus Revolution: How God Transformed an Unlikely Generation and How He Can Do It Again Today by Greg Laurie and Ellen Vaughn, the audience watches a church return to its roots. It welcomes everyone, washes feet, and adds music to the repertoire. As the church builds, you will love it and be inspired. Nevertheless, the church changes as Lonnie's ego grows larger. This movie feels like it wants to start a new Jesus movement, but it's too long. Within the first hour, viewers will begin looking at their watches as the plot focuses on the relationship between Greg and Cathe, not Chuck, Lonnie, and the church.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Scott enjoys the spoils of being an Avenger. Hope took over the company, PymVanDyne, after her father, Hank, stepped down.<br/><br/>Scott finishes his latest book signing when he gets a phone call from jail. The police arrested Cassie during a protest. Scott and Hope bail Cassie out of jail, and he scolds her actions. Cassie informs Scott that she has been working on something big. During Scott's five years away, Cassie studied Hank's notes and created a quantum sonar to map the Quantum Realm. As Cassie explains how it works, she turns it on. Cassie mentions that the device is a two-way radio, and Janet, Hope's mom, is petrified. Janet demands Cassie turn it off. But when Cassie doesn't listen, Janet breaks it. The device turns itself on and sucks Janet, Hank, Hope, Cassie, and Scott into the Quantum Realm.<br/><br/>Cassie and Scott land in the territory of the Quantum Realm's freedom fighters. Veb gives them an ooze to help them understand the locals while Jentorra and Quaz question them. The ruler took over their land and built his empire on their friends' bones. They know the ruler will come looking for Janet because Janet betrayed him. And the ruler will bring MODOK after Cassie and Scott if they know Janet.<br/><br/>Janet, Hank, and Hope land in the city where everyone remembers Janet as a rebel. Janet's old ally, Krylar, comes to the bar to let Janet know things changed after she left. Now, he works for the ruler, Kang The Conqueror. The sheer panic on Janet's face causes Hope to demand answers. Janet tells Hope that Kang crash-landed in the Quantum Realm on her farm. He was stranded because his Multiverse Power Core broke on impact. Janet helped Kang and made a friend. When she put it into his aircraft, she discovered it was a neurotransmitter that allowed her to read his thoughts. She saw what he did and what he planned to do. Janet ripped out the core and enlarged it to an unusable size. Janet knows Kang will need Pym Particles to fix the core and complete his mission. Scott has them in his suit. Janet, Hank, and Hope have to stay together, find Cassie and Scott, and escape; before Kang finds them, gets the particles, and conquers worlds across space and time.<br/><br/>This movie provides a 10-minute recap and an update on Scott's life before the action starts. Then the plot forges ahead to introduce a side of the Quantum Realm viewers haven't seen and a few new characters. Before seeing this movie, you should watch Avengers 3 and 4, Ant-Man 1 and 2, Doctor Strange 2, and Loki to understand the Quantum Realm, the multiverse, the blip, and Kang. The computer graphics team created a new world with unique creatures, buildings, and machines. The writer injected enough humor to relieve the tension but not so much that it took away from the script. And the portrayal of Kang is a masterclass in bad-guy acting. His most dangerous moments are during his calmest speeches. He is a captivating character that has a definite future in the MCU. While 3D isn't necessary, there is a mid-credit and post-credit scene. Of course, this isn't the best MCU film, but a strong start for phase five and the best Ant-Man film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
