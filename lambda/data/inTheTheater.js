    "review":"Max is invited to a kissing party with the popular kids, including his crush.  Max requests for the invitation to be extended to his friends Thor and Lucas.   The cool kids decide to let them all come.  Now, Max has one big problem: he has to learn how to kiss.  After several failed attempts to learn kissing, they use Max's dad's drone to watch Thor's neighbor kiss her boyfriend.  She spots the drone and takes it out.  Max has to get the drone back or he will be grounded and can't attend the party.<br/><br/>As a warning, if you can't handle seeing kids curse, drink, and play with adult toys, this isn't the movie for you.  This coming-of-age story is just as raunchy as Superbad.  And with everything being so over-the-top, the resolution was the most honest and heartfelt of anything in this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bernadette has been slowly falling apart since she lost her desire to design.  Now, her husband Elgin is worried she is suicidal.  On the other hand, her daughter Bee believes her mother just needs space.  After a call from the FBI, Elgin orchestrates an intervention.  During the intervention, Bernadette escapes and goes missing.  Elgin believes she will come back on her own but her daughter wants to look for her.  So, where'd you go, Bernadette?<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the title.  This isn't a mystery of where did she go physically but mentally.  You always know where Bernadette is located but not what originally caused her to lose her love of design.  If you are into cynical humor and personal growth stories, see this one matinee.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"47 Meters Down: Uncaged",
    "review":"Nicole, Alexa, and Sasha convince Mia to go on an underwater cave diving excursion.  The girls are impressed by all the Mayan statues and markings.  After a cloud of dust is kicked up, the girls lose sight of each other.  Alexa is elated to find Ben.  Just as he gathers all the girls to leave, a shark eats him. Freaking out, the girls try to leave, but their only known way out caves in.  Now, they are stuck underwater with less than 50% oxygen in the tank.  They must find a way out or die.<br/><br/>A sequel that is not a sequel is the best way to describe this movie.  Unlike the first, being 47 meters down isn't the problem.  Just sharks.  By taking out this element, the movie is not a sequel.  It is more a cross between Crawl and Deep Blue Sea.  It even has a Sam Jackson moment.  If you are a fan of shark week, see it matinee.  Otherwise, wait for Redbox.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Zack, a 22-year-old with Down Syndrome, escapes the retirement home in the dead of night.  The next morning, he hides in a boat.  Soon, the boat starts to move.  Tyler, a fisherman, has jumped in the boat and sailed off to avoid Duncan and Ratboy.  Tyler stole their crab haul and burned $12,000 of materials.  Tyler docks his boat in deep marshes and turns off the boat.  Then, he hears Zack throwing up.  Tyler silences Zack and escapes Duncan and Ratboy.  Tyler wants to leave Zack behind until he learns Zack is an outlaw like him.  Now, on his way to Florida, Tyler promises to help Zack achieve his dream: To go to Salt Water Redneck Wrestling school and become a professional wrestler.  It will be tough because Tyler's nurse, Eleanor, will move heaven and earth to find him.  Ratboy and Duncan will go through fire and brimstone to find Tyler.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that will have you smiling when you leave the theater.   Each character finds a flaw in how they looked at the world and grow together.  This movie is safe for tweens and teens.  It will teach then kindness, friendship, and respect.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Brian wants to continue his deferred dream of being in the NFL.  But the new law to fit paroled sex-offenders with an ankle monitor has cut that dream short again.  Seven years ago, with bad legal counsel, he pleaded no contest to rape charges.  He was told he would get probation.

This story will inspire you to join in the fight with the California Innocence Project.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
