    "mtitle":"Haunted Mansion",
    "review":"Doctor Gabbie and Travis move to New Orleans to turn a large mansion into a bed and breakfast. After noticing a lot of unexplained incidences, they both leave. But they later return and call Father Kent to perform an exorcism on the home. Father Kent attempts to clear the home but fails, so he researches others who can help. He discovers that Ben, an astrophysicist, created a camera lens to capture spirits in images. Father Kent asks Ben to bring his camera to Gabbie's home and take pictures for $2,000.<br/><br/>Upon arriving, Ben noticed his camera's battery died. But he goes to Gabbie's doorstep anyway. Gabbie warns Ben that if he enters the home, it will change the course of his life forever. He takes a few fake photos, scribbles fraudulent notes, and tells Gabbie the house is free from ghosts. Ben goes home, but a ghost follows him there. The ghost tells Ben to go back. Ben returns with a working camera to discover that Father Kent lives there because the ghost forced him to return too. They get more resources. First, they find a historian, Professor Bruce, to dig up the home's past owners and what happened in the home. Next, they need a psychic, Harriet, to learn what the ghosts want. With their dream team, can they clear the house to free themselves from it?<br/><br/>Based on Haunted Mansion, this standalone sequel mixes strong themes of grief and loss with well-timed humor and horror. The movie is the embodiment of New Orleans, where funeral parades turn sadness into joy. Yes, it has a few jump scares, but it's equivalent to Scooby Doo with Disney-quality animation. It's fun but more appropriate for older kids and adults because it delves into serial murder and mentions a mistress. There are zero post-credit scenes, but it ends with a New Orleans-style party. This movie is gentle about death while being funny and a little scary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Barbie",
    "review":"Barbie lives in her dreamhouse. She takes a waterless shower, eats her perfect pretend breakfast, and floats to her car. Barbie goes to the beach to relax, and Ken waits for Barbie to notice him. Ken asks to visit Barbie's house, and she invites him to her blowout party with choreography.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Barbie's party until Barbie asks them if they think about death. She laughs it off and continues dancing. In the morning, Barbie wakes up tired, her waterless shower is cold, and the pretend breakfast isn't edible. Barbie confesses that something is wrong, and the other Barbies tell her to go to Weird Barbie.<br/><br/>Barbie goes to Weird Barbie and tells her everything that happened. Barbie's little girl in the real world is sad, and it affects how she plays with Barbie. Barbie doesn't understand how this could happen because playing with Barbie made the lives of real girls perfect like her. Barbie heads to the real world with Ken stowing away in the backseat. She will find her girl, help her, and return to Barbieland with her body and mind in tack. However, the real world will change Barbieland in ways Barbie never dreamed, but Ken always imagined.<br/><br/>This movie starts with all the pink, butterflies, and glitter you expect from Barbie. It has all the Barbies you remember as a little child, even discontinued Barbies like Midge, Growing Up Skipper, and TV Barbie. When she enters the real world, she sees it isn't perfect. And little girls aren't thanking her for making a difference. Ken sees the human world and loves it. Men are working, driving big cars, and focusing on each other. The real world has a lasting effect on both of them.<br/><br/>As the trailer says, this film is for people who love and hate Barbie because it focuses on Barbie's issues while addressing her contributions. During the trip to Barbie, Barbie talks to her owner, Sasha, and Sasha's mother, Gloria. Gloria gives a speech to Barbie, who is having an existential crisis, and it will make you sigh with understanding and exhaustion. You leave this film with your eyes open, your feelings heard, and loving Barbie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Oppenheimer",
    "review":"J. Robert Oppenheimer sits in front of a security hearing board because he wants to maintain his security clearance. He recounts his life before and during his government work under scads scrutiny. He teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and dedicates time to the California Institute of Technology. Oppenheimer crosses paths with Ernest Lawrence, Jean Tatlock, and his future wife, Katherine Puening.<br/><br/>General Leslie Groves seeks out Oppenheimer to work on the Manhattan Project but worries Oppenheimer's communist ties will delay his clearance. Oppenheimer assures Groves that he only has an academic interest in the party, not a devotion. Oppenheimer wasn't sure about creating the Atomic Bomb but wanted to end World War II. So he agreed to do it because the only scientist in Germany with Oppenheimer's knowledge was Jewish. They know Hitler won't give him funding.<br/><br/>Oppenheimer convinces Groves to create a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with places to pray, shop, and attend school. Oppenheimer and his researchers work before the town is complete, and William L. Borden enters with startling calculations. His math proves the Atomic Bomb could cause an explosion in the atmosphere and create a chain reaction that destroys the world. Oppenheimer asks Lewis Strauss to introduce him to Albert Einstein. He gives Albert the calculations, and Albert confirms them. Oppenheimer must continue his work with the constant threat of annihilation hanging over his head. And he will bring death to thousands if it works as expected. Can Oppenheimer accept the applause and responsibility of being a modern-day Prometheus?<br/><br/>The director made this movie with extreme precision for the period, the scientists, and their struggles. If you pay close attention, this historical film has the drama of a daytime soap opera. This movie follows Oppenheimer's life before, during, and after the Atomic Bomb. It acknowledges his flaws and brilliance throughout his career. Also, it addresses some controversies and conspiracies that surrounded him. This battle is compelling because it's between two competitive, intelligent, and petty men. This movie covers ample history, but it's not for children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1",
    "review":"Days ago, Ethan got a message to find his ally Ilsa Faust and obtain the missing half of a cruciform key. After giving Ethan his instructions, Eugene Kittridge loses contact with Ethan. Kittridge sits in a classified meeting with Director Denlinger and his advisors and reveals information about Impossible Mission Force. Kittridge explains that experimental Artificial Intelligence meant to hack digital information went rogue and became self-aware and self-learning. They call it the Entity, the biggest threat to the world. They need Ethan to destroy it because other world powers know about the Entity and seek to harness it for global domination. Ethan must remain resilient against his past to secure the world's future. But can Ethan risk the ones he loves?<br/><br/>Based on the TV series, this Mission Impossible installment is the seventh in the franchise and lives up to the crazy stunts and spine-tingling drama of the previous six. The writers inject the right amount of humor at the most opportune moments. New fans don't need to see the previous movies to understand this film. The plot sticks to AI and Machine Learning fears in other films, but the action sets it apart. There are zero mid-credit or post-credit scenes. And yes, it ends on the perfect cliffhanger. Fans of the franchise won't be disappointed and will look forward to part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny",
    "review":"Indiana Jones and Basil Shaw battle the Nazis to recover the Lance of Longinus on a Nazi plunder train. However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist JÃ¼rgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half. Jones takes Helena to the school's archives and removes the machine from a hidden drawer. When CIA operatives distract Jones, Helena grabs the Dial and runs away.<br/><br/>The operatives work for Voller, who now hides as a NASA scientist on the recently-successful Apollo 11 project. They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
