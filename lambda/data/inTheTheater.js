They just need one thing: the address.<br/><br/>This is not a \"coming-of-age\" movie.  These woman are strong, smart, and liked.  They just forgot to have fun.  Their friendship and world views will be tested.  And you will laugh at every milestone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

After 20 minutes under water and 25 minutes of rescue efforts, the nurses stop working to allow John's mother to say her goodbyes.  As she prays for God to save her son, his heart starts beating again.  She will need her faith, her family, and her pastor to get her through as she prays for her son.<br/><br/>This movie will have you in tears.  While it shows John's journey, it doesn't sugar coat his mom's struggles.  She appeared to be a rock but she was pushing others away.  Also, this movie give insight to John's experience after his survival.  See it with the whole family..<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

But when she looks past his facade, can she resist is charms?  What will it costs Tessa to have Hardin in her life?<br/><br/>This movie is twilight without vampires.  Nothing really sets it apart from other teen angst movies.  Since it is book one in a 4 book series, the movie ends on a cliff hanger.  If you are a fan of the genre, see it matinee.  Otherwise, wait for Redbox..<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Lionel is surprised the letter writer about the Sasquatch, is the Sasquatch.  He offers to give Lionel proof of his existence, if Lionel takes him to meet is cousins:  The Yeti of the Himalayas.<br/><br/>This movie is only fun for the first and last 10 minutes.  The rest of the movie is boring.  Even the amazing graphics can't save this film.  Wait for cable.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jordan wakes up in her 13 year old body with no idea of how to get back.  Her assistant, April, has to run Jordan's company while creating a new app for her biggest client in 48 hours.  And to make matters worst, Jordan must enroll in the same school she was bullied in as a teen.  Jordan must find her authentic self or be stuck at 13 forever.<br/><br/>This movie, inspired by Big, has several laughs but few are memorable.  The moments that stick out are the duet with April and Jordan, and a bonding moment between Jordan and Trevor.  This is a good one to catch in the theaters but you won't have an urge to buy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
