    "mtitle": "Rob Peace",
    "review": "Robert DeShaun Peace sits on the porch and waits for his father, Robert 'Skeet' Douglas, to pick him up. Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Borderlands",
    "review": "Long ago, an alien race known as the Eridian created a vault on Pandora. It has power and knowledge inside. But only a person with Eridian blood can open it with three keys. Atlas, the CEO of Atlas Corporation, believes his daughter, Tiny Tina, is an Eridian descendant. Atlas sends his soldier, Roland, to save Tina and bring her to him. Roland goes rogue and saves Tina with the help of an imprisoned psycho, Krieg.<br/><br/>Bounty Hunter Lilith brings her latest catch to a bar on the planet, Cytherea. Atlas has his men deliver a message. He wants Lilith to find Tina and hands her a beacon to summon him when she does. Atlas pays her, and she agrees.<br/><br/>Lilith arrives on Pandora and shoots something in the distance. It jokingly screams because it's an indestructible robot named Claptrap. Lilith wants to leave the robot behind until she learns it can access the ECHOnet. Lilith gives Claptrap a photo of Tina and asks it to scan the net for any sightings. Claptrap quickly locates Tina.<br/><br/>Lilith drives to Tina's last location and uncovers her hiding spot. When Tina discovers Lilith is there to return her to Atlas, Tina and Krieg attack. Their battle alerts Atlas's army to their position. Roland rides in and grabs Tina, Lilith, Krieg, and Claptrap.<br/><br/>Tina explains that Atlas doesn't love her. He only wants her because she can open the vault. When she does, he will use the knowledge to create weapons. Lilith decides to help Roland and Krieg save Tina. Can these scoundrels save Tina from Atlas and find the vault to save Pandora before Atlas takes control?<br/><br/>The movie has comical moments but won't make you laugh out loud. It has action but nothing new. Also, the twist is very predictable because the script plants blaring clues. This film is for the video game lovers who don't skip the dialog. It's a new adventure in a vibrant world but a forseeable premise. The only reason to see this movie in theaters is for the graphics and fight scenes. Otherwise, wait for a streaming service.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "It Ends With Us",
    "review": "Lily Bloom returns to Plethora, Maine, to attend her father's funeral. Her mother, Jenny, asks Lily to give the eulogy. Lily stands before the mourners and says nothing. She can't think of one kind thing to say about the man who abused her mother. Lily runs out of the church, drives home to Boston, and finds a rooftop with a view.<br/><br/>Lily sits on the ledge when a man, Ryle, enters and kicks the furniture. They share naked truths. Lily admits she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Then Ryle admits he wants to sleep with Lily but warns he is a one-night guy. Lily is a relationship girl and leaves.<br/><br/>Lily gets the keys to her new shop and starts throwing the junk away. She wants to turn the space into a flower shop in a few weeks. A woman, Allysa, enters and questions Lily about the Help Wanted sign. Allysa receives a call from her husband, Marshall. She alerts Lily that her brother is coming with Marshall, and they are wearing onesies for free beer. Stunned, Lily learns Ryle is Allysa's brother. After a few meet-ups, Ryle wants to try having a relationship with Lily.<br/><br/>Jenny wants to try a new restaurant named Root and asks Lily to join. Ryle accompanies Lily, and they order drinks. Lily sees a memorable scar on the waiter's hand. It's Atlas. Lily excuses herself from the table and sneaks away to talk to Atlas. They update each other on their lives and relationships.<br/><br/>Days later, Ryle makes frittatas to celebrate his upcoming ground-breaking surgery. They drink mimosas, kiss, and laugh until they smell burning food. Ryle grabs the food without oven mitts and swears. Then, Lily is on the floor with a black eye. She pushes Ryle away, and he cuts his hand. He kisses her and says it was an accident. She believes him.<br/><br/>Ryle told Allysa how great the food at Root was. Now, she wants to try it. As Marshall chats, Atlas sees Lily's eye and Ryle's bandaged hand. Atlas walks away from the table without a word. Lily runs to the bathroom to panic, and Atlas follows her. He demands that she leave Ryle. Lily exits the bathroom, and Ryle is standing there. Atlas and Ryle fight, Atlas orders Ryle to leave immediately, and Lily follows. She promises not to see Atlas or his eatery again. She hopes this eases Ryle's concerns. However, it's the start of a dangerous yet familiar path.<br/><br/>Based on It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover, this movie delves into the mind of an abuse survivor. Lily grew up watching her dad hurt her mother. She knows the warning signs and excuses but doesn't see them in her relationship. The script allows the audience to fall in love with Ryle and Atlas by showing the past and the present. The movie doesn't have Lily's internal monologue as she finds ways to defend Ryle's behavior. So, when viewers see the abuse first, they see it through Lily's delusion. If you are someone who pored over the book, you will notice sweeping changes. However, the core of the story is there.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Trap",
    "review": "Cooper smiles as his daughter, Riley, dances and sings to her favorite artist, Lady Raven. As they wait in line to scan their tickets, Cooper notices officers with high-powered rifles.<br/><br/>They settle into their seats as Lady Raven performs for 20,000 people. Cooper spots police officers taking men out of the audience. Cooper enters the bathroom stall, pulls out his phone, and checks on Spencer. Spencer is the person Cooper chained in a basement. Cooper gleams as Spencer pulls his chains, cries, and begs for help.<br/><br/>During the intermission, Riley wants concert merchandise. The vendor, Jamie, loves Cooper's example. He offers to find another shirt later if Cooper returns in 10 minutes. Cooper pulls Jamie aside and asks why the arena has a vast police presence. Jamie whispers that the concert is a trap. The FBI discovered that 'The Butcher' would be there. The Butcher is a notorious serial killer who dismembered a dozen victims. They have SWAT covering every exit, FBI profiler Dr. Josephine Grant in The Butcher's head, and they will stop every man.<br/><br/>Cooper tests the security. He sees a drunken girl wobbling near a staircase. He bumps into her, and she falls. Arena security runs to her aid, but SWAT doesn't move. Cooper has to find a way out of the trap without tipping off Riley. Can he make it out?<br/><br/>This movie builds slowly for 15 minutes to allow the audience to see Cooper's bond with Riley and Riley's admiration for Lady Raven. Viewers will notice little quirks in Cooper's character before he sits with his daughter. It's not until Cooper looks at his phone that you understand the depths of his depravity. Cooper maneuvers around the arena with precision, finesse, and dumb luck. With this director, you expect a twist. However, there are several that will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you root for Cooper.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Harold and the Purple Crayon",
    "review": "Harold uses his imagination and a purple crayon to draw the world around him as a narrator dictates his actions. He wonders if he illustrated his friends, Moose and Porcupine, then who drew him. The narrator explains Harold's creator is him. He is Harold's old man. Harold wants to meet the 'old man,' but the narrator tells Harold they can't meet because he lives in the real world.<br/><br/>Harold wakes with a list of questions for the 'old man,' but he doesn't respond. He draws a door to the real world and walks through. Harold stands awed by his three-dimensional form and Moose's human body. They find older men but not theirs. So, Harold draws a bike and peddles in the middle of the street.<br/><br/>Terry drives while talking to her boss on the phone with her son, Mel, in the back seat. She reaches to recover her dropped phone, and Mel screams. Terry swerves to miss two men on a bike. They fall to the grass, and Terry's tire blows. As Terry calls roadside assistance, Harold draws her a tire that manifests. Mel sees this and remains mum. Terry allows Moose and Harold to stay in her garage apartment for the night.<br/><br/>Harold and Mel talk that night, and Harold shows Mel the magic behind his purple crayon. Harold breaks the crayon in half and gives a piece to Mel. In exchange, Mel offers to help Harold find his old man. After an exhaustive search, Harold finds a flyer for the library.<br/><br/>Mel finds the head librarian, Gary, reading excerpts from his book in a nearly empty room. Mel rolls his eyes and asks for help. Gary jokingly suggests they sky-write a message with a phone number. Harold runs outside with Mel and Moose and begins to draw. Gary looks out the window and sees Harold's plane come to life. He runs to the shelves and finds Crockett Johnson's book. Gary wants Harold's crayon and will do anything to get it.<br/><br/>Based on Harold and the Purple Crayon by Crockett Johnson, this comical movie has charming qualities while entertaining a younger audience. It glorifies the power of imagination as Harold draws a tire, skate ramp, and puma. Harold is on a quest to find his narrator but finds his purpose. He embraces other's imagination and leads with kindness. However, he is a rule breaker. This film is for Harold fans, fantastical plot lovers, and families.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
