    "review":"Patrick Hill joins Fortico security after they lost two drivers in an armored truck robbery. His trainer, Bullet, explains that Patrick must get 70 or above to get the job.  Patrick scores 70 on the nose, and Bullet nicknames him H.  Their boss, Terry, put H together with Bullet and Dave. On the second drop, Bullet goes in alone and never comes out.  Dave calls over the walkie-talkie but gets static.  Then a voice comes over the system and tells Dave and H to give up the money or Bullet dies. H starts to turn over the cash but pulls out his gun and shoots each of the robbers in the head.  Dave and Bullet notice H's expert precision doesn't match what he did during training, and they mention it to Terry.  H chalks it up to adrenaline, and Terry orders him to take time off with PTSD counseling.  However, the owner, Blake, says H's legendary status is good for business, and Blake wants H back on the streets immediately. A few months back, H witnesses the murder of his son, Dougie, during the armored truck robbery, the same robbery that left a spot open for H..  And to make matters worse, H was involved in the robbery with just two simple words: the latter.  Now, H is on a mission to find the man that killed Dougie and end his life.<br/><br/>Based on Cash Truck, this movie has John Wick's action with Equalizer's morals and Quentin Tarantino's storytelling.  So you need to be at the theater and in your seat from beginning to end.  In four chapters, this movie peels itself like an onion. The heist, with the mastermind narrating the plan as you see it take place, is perfection.  With this narration, you will hear what should happen and what went wrong.  Don't be shocked if inappropriate moments make you laugh. This movie will be an easy favorite for the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Charlie Berns is the senior writing advisor for the comedy sketch show called This Just In. He leaves the producer's office to fulfill an auction prize to benefit an inner-city library. The winner is Emma, and she sings funny songs in dive bars and subways for money. Emma explains she doesn't know who Charlie is but her ex-boyfriend bid on the lunch, and she took it to get back at him.  During lunch, Emma has an allergic reaction to seafood, and Charlie rushes her to the hospital.  Without medical insurance for the hospital care, ambulance ride, and prescriptions, Emma runs up a $2,000 bill that Charlie pays.  She promises to pay him back every dime.  A few days later, Emma has the first installment, but a bike rider hurts her knee in a hit-and-run. Charlie brings her inside to help patch her up.  She notices that Charlie has pictures on the wall with names and asks if he is a serial killer.  He explains the photographs are of his daughter, Francine, son, Rex, and granddaughter, Lindsay. Later, Emma attends an anniversary interview for Charlie's first movie.  But she spies something is off with Charlie when he forgets the name of the stars of his film.  She meets Charlie after the interview, and he admits that he is in the early stages of dementia. She decides to stay by Charlie's side until he gets the courage to tell his family.  Until then, she is here today.<br/><br/>Based on The Prize by Alan Zweibel, this movie is a poignant look at love and friendship grounded in humor.  Charlie meets Emma as his past crashes with his doomed future. During these moments of lost memories, Charlie has vivid flashbacks about his past with his children and wife, Carrie. Even as his world falls apart, he makes jokes. Emma doesn't help him out of obligation, but out of concern and love.  This movie will become a favorite while bringing a tear to your eye and a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Water Man",
    "review":"Gunner sits in his room and writes his graphic novel about Detective Knoxx, a ghost attempting to solve his murder. When Gunner tells his parents, Amos and Mary, that he went to a funeral for more research, Amos can't hide his disbelief. In an attempt to connect with Gunner, Amos walks into Gunner's room to play catch, but Amos steps on his graphic novel, ruining it.  Gunner leaves and rides his bike around town.  On his ride, he sees an abandoned mill with The Water Man painted on the side.  He hears a young girl, Jo, telling a group of kids that she encountered The Water Man and survived. Back at home, Gunner tries to sleep but has a nightmare.  He searches for Mary and finds a frail, bald figure in the bathroom.  Gunner had no idea that Mary's leukemia advanced so aggressively.  Instead of researching detective novels, Gunner focuses on leukemia and anatomy.  Inside one of the books, Gunner finds notes about The Water Man.  Since the author is local, Gunner goes to Bussey's home to get more information.  Bussey explains that The Water Man found a vein of shiny material in a cave and he carved a rock out of it. When the dam broke, everyone in the town, including The Water Man's wife, died.  But The Water Man lived, and he believed it was because of the shining rock he found.  The rock made him immortal.  Now, he searches the woods for his wife's body to give her immortality. Gunner wants to find The Water Man to heal Mary.  And he knows just who can help find The Water Man, Jo. With two kids in the woods, Amos goes on a hunt to find Gunner without telling Mary.  Amos knows he is on borrowed time because there is a danger roaring in the woods that will annihilate Gunner and Jo.  And it isn't The Water Man.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo's directorial debut is a promising award contender this year.  Mixing animation with real-life allows the viewer to see life in Gunner's rich fantasy world. This movie isn't only about Gunner finding The Water Man.  It's about Gunner and Amos finding common ground. By being apart, they call for each other in the darkness and find their bond.  It's a compelling story that will resonate with the whole family.  Be warned, there are a few scary moments, but those are short-lived and explained.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Deb wakes up to the sound of frantic knocking on her door. It's her youngest daughter, Molly.  Molly became an opioid addict at 16-years-old after an injury.  Molly begs Deb for a place to stay because she wants to detox, but Deb says no. Deb is exhausted at the state and sight of Molly, but Deb doesn't cave.  She tells Molly to stay away until she is clean and shuts the door.  Throughout the night, Deb checks her front steps and sees Molly sleeping.  In the morning, Deb offers to drive Molly to Clear Horizons Detox center for help. With Medicaid, Molly can detox for three days, and then she can leave.  After three days, Deb goes to the detox center to pick up Molly, and the doctor pulls them into a room.  Since heroin has a 97% relapse rate and this detox is Molly's 15th try, the doctor believes she would be a prime candidate for opioid agonist therapy. But the patient must be drug-free for a week to start and continue the therapy.  When Molly learns she has to stay clean for four more days, she has a meltdown. When the past, lies, and neglect boil to the surface, can Molly and Deb survive four days clean and with each other?<br/><br/>Based on 'How's Amanda? A story of Truth, Lies, and an American Addiction,' this movie will provoke all the feelings you have when watching Intervention.  Deb scrutinizes everything Molly says and does through the filter of an addict.  While this movie shows Molly in the depths of her addiction, it displays the impact it has on the people around her and Deb. This movie holds nothing back about addiction and the ripple effect of pain it causes.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Mortal Kombat",
    "review":"In the 17th century, the Outworld wants to end the Mortal Kombat competition before it begins. By killing Hanzo's bloodline, they can ensure defeat in Mortal Kombat and take over the Earthrealm.  With Hanzo, his son, and his wife dead, Bi-Han leaves with a feeling of accomplishment.  However, before the face-off between Hanzo and Bi-Han, Bi-Han's wife hid their daughter.  Knowing Hanzo is dead, Raiden comes to Earth and rescues Hanzo's daughter.  Today, Cole battles in an MMA cage match. After losing, yet again, Jax approaches Cole and asks him about his dragon logo.  Cole's daughter tells Jax the logo is his birthmark. Cole and his family eat at a diner, and it starts to snow, but Cole points out that it's July.  Then they see Sub-Zero freezing the world around them.  Jax pulls up in his car and yells at them to get in.  Jax tells Cole that his birthmark is a champion's mark, and Jax has the same marking. So, Jax gets out of the car, gives Cole a name and address, and allows Cole to leave with this family while he fights Sub-Zero. Sonya invites Cole inside her bunker and explains that the Earth is in danger.  In the last 9 Mortal Kombats, the Outworld reign supreme.  If they win again, the Earth and everyone on it will become a slave to the Outworld.  This battle to the death will force Cole to face his past, gifts, and destiny.<br/><br/>Based on the popular game Mortal Kombat, this movie offers lots of graphics and battles to feast your eyes upon.  However, the writers' breeze through the history of Mortal Kombat so quickly, you could miss it if you cough. The script tells these impactful points in less than 15 seconds.  This movie makes up for its flaws with an eye-catching final fighting scene with a nod to the game.  The final image left the possibility for a part two, but viewers shouldn't keep their fingers crossed for that.  And don't stay after the end credits.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
