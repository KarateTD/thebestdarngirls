    "mtitle": "Mufasa: The Lion King",
    "review": "Simba runs to find Nala and leaves their daughter, Kiara, with Rafiki, Timon, and Pumbaa. Kiara dreams she could be as strong as her grandfather. Rafiki explains that Mufasa wasn't always a king. Rafiki sits Kiara down and tells the story of her grandfather, Mufasa: The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mufasa and his parents, Afia and Masego, are living through drought. Mufasa's mother, Afia, tells Mufasa that the drought won't last forever. Until then, he should look at the horizon. Beyond the light is a land called Milele. Everything in Milele flows in abundance. Then, the rain falls. Mufasa and his family go to the watering hole with the other animals. Later, they hear a rumble and see a flood. An elephant hits the dam, and the water sweeps Mufasa away.<br/><br/>Mufasa struggles on a branch when a cub, Taka, appears. He is the son of King Obasi and Obasi's mate, Eshe. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him ashore. Eshe tells Taka to leave Mufasa alone because Obasi doesn't like strays. Eshe has compassion for the cub and brings Mufasa to the pride. Obasi wants to eat Mufasa, but Mufasa says he is too fast. Obasi creates Taka's first challenge to prove he can be a king. If Taka beats Mufasa in a race, Obasi will eat Mufasa. If Mufasa wins, then he can stay with their pride. They race, but Eshe sees that Taka lets Mufasa win. Obasi keeps his promise but tells Mufasa he must live with the females.<br/><br/>As Taka and Mufasa grow, their brotherly bond becomes tighter, much to Obasi's displeasure. Taka wants to learn how to hunt like Mufasa, but Obasi says his place is sleeping on a rock, protecting the pride. When Obasi falls asleep, Taka follows Eshe to learn. They hear others approaching but don't have time to escape. Mufasa saves Eshe while Taka runs away.<br/><br/>The remaining white lion returns to the leader, Kiros. With a lowered head, the surviving lion explains that Mufasa killed Kiros's son while saving Eshe. Then, he pledges vengeance for his son.<br/><br/>Mufasa can smell Kiros and his pride coming. Eshe tells Taka and Mufasa to leave and protect each other. Kiros believes there can only be one king. They slaughter Obasi's pride. However, Kiros knows the lion who killed his son isn't there. He orders his pride to track Mufasa and Taka. He vows to kill the pair, avenge his son, and become the king.<br/><br/>This Lion King prequel starts with a tribute to James Earl Jones. Then, it transports the audience to Pride Rock. It's not Mufasa's story alone. It's the tale of two brothers, entitlement, courage, and the king's court. By staying with the pride's females, Mufasa learned lessons that separated him from the others. Mufasa's journey mirrors Simba's. He leaves home for safety and finds friends along the way. The graphics far surpass the live adaptation of The Lion King, and the voice acting is stellar. The music flows wonderfully with the theme, although it drowns out the vocal performances. Also, the backing track makes the room vibrate and crescendos with the sun. This film is an astounding prequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3",
    "review": "Tom, Maddie, Tails, and Knuckles throw Sonic a surprise B-EARTH-Day party to celebrate the day he landed on the planet. Tom and Maddie revel in the quiet when a beam of light comes from a helicopter. Director Rockwell exits and asks for Team Sonic's help. An alien escaped a private base in Tokyo. And they can't catch him. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles board the helicopter.<br/><br/>Team Sonic lands in Tokyo and can't believe the alien standing before them looks like Sonic. His name is Shadow. Sonic chases after him, but Shadow outsmarts him. The team meets Commander Walters at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Commander Walters explains that Shadow landed on Earth 50 years ago inside a meteorite. They hid him in a top-secret base to study his powers under the guidance of a professor. The professor's granddaughter, Maria, bonded with Shadow and became best friends. Then, an accident at the base took Maria's life. Now that Shadow is free, he wants revenge for Maria.<br/><br/>Hours ago, someone hacked their system and lowered their defenses. Reports state that Dr. Robotnik's symbol emerged on the screen during the hack. Then, Robotnik's drones enter the restaurant and aim for the team after fatally wounding Commander Walters. Walters hands Sonic a key to a powerful weapon. A motorcyclist rides into the restaurant, incapacitates the attack drones, and exits. The team follows the cyclist until he stops. It's Agent Stone. He says someone framed Dr. Robotnik, and he has proof.<br/><br/>Agent Stone takes the team to Dr. Robotnik's lair. When he learns someone stole his tech, Dr. Robotnik chooses to work with Team Sonic to find the culprit. However, he needs something from Sonic. Sonic rolls his eyes and pulls out a quill. This unlikely mash-up must stop Shadow's revenge and keep the key out of the wrong person's hands.<br/><br/>It may be unbelievable, but this film is the best of the trilogy. First, this adventure is worldwide. Second, this film is about the toxic nature of anger and revenge. Third, this movie respects its core audience by referencing old tech, movies, and jokes. However, it doesn't forget its new fans. The movie kept a steady pace while introducing new characters. The plot didn't waste time recapping the last films. This film is an animated action-adventure comedy for the whole family with mid- and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Gladiator II",
    "review": "Twin Emperors Geta and Caracalla rule Rome 16 years after Marcus Aurelius's death. The twins ignored Marcus's vision of a Roman government ruled by the people. They want to expand their dominance to other countries with the help of their general, Acacius. Acacius and his soldiers are victorious, capture the defeated soldiers, and make them slaves to Rome, including a refugee named Hanno. Acacius takes the slaves to Ostia. There, Macrinus will determine which slaves will make the best gladiators.<br/><br/>Acacius sees the emperors' corrupt ways and becomes disillusioned with Roman rule. He shares his thoughts with his wife, Lucilla. She shares her father's vision and agrees with Acacius. They must find people who agree and secretly overthrow the emperors.<br/><br/>Macrinus studies the slaves, and Hanno captures his eye. Hanno recites a passage from a Roman poet. Macrinus can see that Hanno has an education. Macrinus despises the emperors' rule and wants to overthrow them too. But he wants Hanno to be his instrument of destruction. Hanno agrees, but only if Macrinus allows him to kill Acacius. Macrinus doesn't know Hanno's secret history to the Roman Empire and true Gladiator.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't focus on the battles like its predecessor. It uses the drama to drive the story forward. This sequel feels more like Shakespeare than an action film. The costumes, dialog, and set design teleport you into 180 AD. However, the audience doesn't rally behind or have concern for Hanno. You will find Macrinus more intriguing than the Gladiator. This picture is bloody and theatrical, but it's missing a spark.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Moana 2",
    "review": "Moana has taken to her Wayfinder roots. She travels to other islands to find people. Moana climbs the tallest mountain, blows her horn, and waits for a response. However, she hears nothing. Moana's parents, Tui and Sina, wait patiently for Moana while her little sister, Simea, runs to her. The village celebrates her return and asks for updates.<br/><br/>Moana takes Simea to the caverns and tells Simea the story about their ancestors - the Wayfinders. Tautai Vasa took his crew to Motufetu Island. But the god Nalo caused a storm that destroyed their canoe. Tui pulls Moana aside. She is the first Wayfinder in generations, and he wants her to accept the title Tautai. Moana humbly takes the title in a ritual. Today, the ancestors want Moana to find Motufetu because it connects people worldwide. Moana wakes and tells her tribe.<br/><br/>Moana prepares to leave, but Sina thinks Moana needs a crew, and Heihei isn't enough. Moana chooses Loto, Kela, and Moni. Moana approaches Moni's tapestry of Maui and whispers for Maui to join her. However, Maui doesn't respond. Moana, Loto, Kela, Moni, Heihei, and Pua travel to find the lost island of Motufetu.<br/><br/>Goddess Matangi holds Maui captive in a secret location. Her boss, God Nalo, is furious with Maui. Maui helped Moana. Nalo knows humans can reunite the people and end his control over the land. A united world would dismantle Nalo's power. Maui tells Matangi that Moana isn't Nalo's problem. Matangi tells Maui that it's too late. Nalo will end Moana. Maui and his tattoo must free themselves and warn Moana to stay away from Motufeto before Matangi and Nalo end the lives of her and her crew.<br/><br/>This sequel expands the island and world of Moana. Moana has friends who help her prepare for her missions. She is a proud chief and Wayfinder. It's best to watch the first movie before seeing the second. The script mentions what happened in the past but doesn't go into great detail. The graphics express the growth of the Disney animation team. The entire theater will light up with their artwork. Children will love the movie. It takes them on a new adventure, focusing on problem-solving, teamwork, and fun. This film has one mid-credit scene, but it's unnecessary to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Three years ago, creatures crawled out of a sinkhole and killed 95% of the human population in a month. The surviving humans call them Reapers and can't kill them. Humans discovered that the Reapers wouldn't go above 8,000 feet. So, they migrated there and created settlements.<br/><br/>Today, Will raises his son, Hunter, on the Rocky Mountains Settlement in Colorado. He lost his wife, Tara, to a Reaper and now raises Hunter alone. During the night, Hunter's alarm rang because his breathing apparatus needed a new filter. Will replaced it but doesn't have another. Without the filter, Hunter will die. Will believes the Boulder Hospital will have boxes of them and creates a plan to descend to retrieve them, but he needs help.<br/><br/>Will walks to Nina's cabin and tells her his plan. She laughs because no one survives a Reaper attack. Will points out that Nina lived. Nina is a physicist from Caltech. She hypothesized a way to kill the Reapers but needed a chemical from her lab. Nina, Tara, and several other people descended to get the items. Nina was the only person who returned. Although Will blames Nina, he needs her to get through them. Nina comes with her Reaper locator. Tara's best friend, Katie, stops them as Will and Nina get extra bullets. She refuses to let Will go without her. They will use the Calway Mines to the Boulder Hospital. He can get the filters for Hunter and save Hunter's life. Can they make it without awakening the Reapers?<br/><br/>This post-apocalyptic thriller ends with a cliffhanger. Will, Nina, and Katie are on different missions but on the same path. Will wants to save his son, Nina desires to help the world, and Katie wants to assist Will. They understand it's a suicide mission but continue on the journey. The plot's antagonist is the Reapers. However, the mid-credit scene points to a larger plan or a part two. The ill-created visual effects are distracting and make the film less scary. This film has the makings of a cult classic, but part two will likely be on a streaming platform.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
