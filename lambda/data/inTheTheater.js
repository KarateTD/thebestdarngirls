    "review":"In 2011, astronauts Brian, Jocinda, and Marcus went on a mission to fix a satellite.  Everything was normal until Brian and Marcus saw a black swarm in space. While Brian and Jocinda were safe, nobody heard from Marcus again.  On earth, Brian tells them about the swarm.  But no one listens.  NASA concludes that Brian's error caused Marcus's death, and they fire Brian.  Today, Brian is a disgrace, and Jocinda works for NASA.<br/><br/>At the University of Californa Irvine, K.C. sneaks into a professor's office to obtain orbital data.  K.C. is a conspiracy theorist who believes the moon is a megastructure built by aliens.  And his obtained data prove the moon is out of orbit and in a crash course with the earth.  K.C. goes to the museum to make Brian pay attention to his warnings.  However, K.C.'s information falls on deaf ears, and Brian has the police escort K.C. out.  K.C. throws his findings at Brian and screams at Brian to read them.  When Brian sees the news about the moon, he finds K.C.'s podcast.  He tracks K.C. down for more information.<br/><br/>Back at NASA, the acting chief left Jocinda in charge.  She is determined to save the world and sends a team to investigate the swarm.  As the home base watches, they see it kill the flight crew.  Jocinda learns that energy attracts it.  Jocinda needs someone who can fly it without power.  And Brian is the only name that comes to mind.<br/><br/>This sci-fi extravaganza is similar to Independence Day and Geostorm.  It is fun to watch all these characters come together for the greater good.  However, this film adds nothing to the genre while hinting at a sequel.  Don't be dismayed.  Although the plot is redundant, the overall script is funny, keeping with the times, and engaging.  This film is an entertaining matinee movie for people older than 10.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars",

    "mtitle":"Redeeming Love",
    "review":"During the gold rush, Angel lives in a brothel called The Palace, and it's in Pair-A-Dice, California.  Every day, the Duchess holds a lottery for men who want to buy Angel's time.<br/><br/>Michael Hosea is a hard-working farmer who tends to his animals and crops tirelessly.  He goes to church and thanks God for his bounty.  But Michael is missing one thing: a wife.  He asks God for a woman who loves to fish with long legs.  Later, he goes into town and sees a beautiful woman walking down the street with a large man in tow.  Michael can't believe the young woman is a prostitute.  He vows to win the lottery and make Angel his wife.<br/><br/>Michael meets with Angel twice, but he can't convince her to leave.  When he visits a third time, he finds Angel badly beaten.  Michael wants to free Angel, but Angel has debt.  Michael gives the Duchess all the money he has and takes Angel.  Later, Angel wakes up in a different bed in a strange house with a ring on her finger.  Michael believes love will keep her, but he doesn't understand that she is fighting her past, figuratively and literally.<br/><br/>Based on Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, this movie is a modern telling of Hosea in a semi-historical setting.  However, don't expect it to be too biblical or historically accurate.  Angel was an illegitimate child, sold after her mother died.  With each mistake in her present, you get a peek into the past that drives her actions.  This tactic works the first couple of times she leaves.  After the last time, you stop caring and want Michael to move on.  If you are passionate about love-conquering-all stories, this film is perfect for a matinee.  Otherwise, wait for on-demand.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The King's Daughter",
    "review":"After winning a long-fought battle, King Louis the 14th addresses his subjects.  Then someone in the crowd tries to assassinate him.  He fears his mortality and wants to live forever.  Against his priest's wishes, Louis seeks the help of his doctor, Dr. Labarthe.  Labarthe heard of a creature from Atlantis with an internal life force.  The doctor will kill it and transplant its life force into Louis after they find it. When everyone leaves King Louis, he asks his priest, Père La Chaise, to bring his daughter, Maria-Josèphe, to the palace.  The king will treat her like the other ladies in Versailles, but she, nor anyone else, will know her lineage.<br/><br/>The nuns come into Maria-Josèphe's room and tell her that King Louis XIV wants her to move to Versailles.  No matter how hard they try, the nuns can't keep Maria-Josèphe out of the sea.  When Maria-Josèphe arrives, Magali greets her and becomes Maria-Josèphe's lady in waiting.  While playing her cello, Maria-Josèphe can hear something echoing her notes in the distance.  She grabs her cello and runs towards the sound.  Maria-Josèphe finds an elaborate tank with the creature inside.  Before she can jump in the water, Yves De La Croix pulls Maria-Josèphe back.  Yves De La Croix commanded the ship that caught the creature and separated it from its mate.  Maria-Josèphe tells Yves De La Croix that it is all but human, and they should release it.  Yves De La Croix tells Maria-Josèphe that it is in the king's control.  The king tells Maria-Josèphe that he wants it to heal everyone in France.  The moment Maria-Josèphe learns the truth about the creature and the king, who will Maria-Josèphe follow.<br/><br/>Based on The Moon and the Sun by Vonda N. McIntyre, this movie did not belong in theaters.  Disney+ or Peacock would be better for this Little Mermaid meets Marie Antoinette sponsored by the ASPCA tale.  If you are awake during the climax, it's a letdown compared to the lengthy build-up.  Skip this movie in the theaters and on-demand.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"CIA agents Nick and Mace have a job to retrieve a master key drive from DNI agent Luis Rojas.  This master key will allow them to hack anything on the internet, and the owner will have unlimited power.  Nick and Mace pose as a married couple to complete the hand-off.  Before they complete the transaction, a waitress spills her drink on Mace's dress, grabs the bag with $3 million, and runs away.  The waitress is BND agent, Marie.  In the end, Mace is in an interrogation room without Luis, Marie, or the money, and Nick is dead.  So her boss suggests Mace go it alone.  But Mace has one friend she can depend on, Khadijah, a former MI6 computer specialist.<br/><br/>Back at his hotel, Luis tries to plan his next move.  Then he gets a knock at the door.  It's Graciela, DNI agent and psychologist.  The DNI worries that Luis went rogue and plans to sell the drive to their enemies.  He assures her that is not his plan.  Several DNI agents flank them as Graciela takes Luis back to DNI headquarters.  But no one knows Mace and Khadijah tracked Luis down and now watch him with Graciela from a higher plane.  When someone shoots Luis, he feels death is imminent.  So he grabs his phone, adds Graciela's fingerprint, and tells her to trust no one.  Marie gets a DNI badge and convinces the officers to turn Graciela over to her before the agents drive away.<br/><br/>Marie takes Graciela to a hotel and allows Graciela to call her family.  Then Khadijah and Mace enter their room with a gun drawn.  After agreeing to join forces, Graciela tells them about Luis's phone.  They tell Graciela that they can't let her go because they need her fingerprint.  If she goes, her finger has to stay.  So Graciela heads to Morroco too.<br/><br/>After a battle through the streets of Morroco, the women get the drive and hand it over to Mace's boss, Marks.  Then Mace sees a startling report on the news.  Someone hacked six passenger planes and caused them to crash, killing hundreds.  Mace knows the drive got into the wrong hands.  They must find it and get it back before someone starts World War III.  But they are missing a piece of the puzzle, MSS agent Lin.  Her government has plans for the drive.  And she has it in her hands to sell to the highest bidder.  When these women and their skills collide, they will create the 355.<br/><br/>This high-octane movie has action from the beginning to the end with lots of hand-to-hand, close quarters combat.  While the action and dialog are fun, the overall plot is predictable.  Since you can anticipate the plot, this movie depends on the action, dialog, and family ties to draw the viewer into the film.  And it does.  While this movie is entertaining on the big screen, you won't have the urge to buy it later.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Thomas sits at his desk creating a video game named Binary when he gets a warning that a hacker purged the Modal 101 file.  While Thomas looks into the hack, Jude tells him their boss, Smith, wants to see him.  Their parent company, Warner Brothers, wants to make a sequel to his trilogy game, The Matrix.  And they will make it with or without Thomas.  Thomas starts to panic because he had a mental breakdown after creating the game.  He couldn't discern reality from dreams.  Now, Thomas sees a therapist to maintain his mental state.<br/><br/>Thomas goes to a coffee shop with co-worker Jude, and Jude forces Thomas to talk to a woman he fixates on every day.  The woman is Tiffany, and she is married with two sons.  Later, they see each other and question him about his game.  She thinks a character, Trinity, looks like her.  Thomas goes back to his office, and an alarm forces an evacuation.  Before Thomas leaves the building, he gets a text message to go to the bathroom.  A man walks out of the stall and introduces himself as Morpheus, and Thomas panics.  Thomas runs to his therapists to handle reality but ends up on top of the roof.  He attempts to jump off and fly when Bugs grabs him.  She tells him the Matrix is real and shows her bunny tattoo.  Her world knows him as the one Neo, and he follows her into the Matrix.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the trilogy has all the effects and wild storylines from its predecessor.  It shows clips of the past for people new to the series.  But, there are phrases, jokes, and other nuances you won't understand without seeing the other films.  While it created an end to the trilogy, it left the door open for something new for the next generation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
