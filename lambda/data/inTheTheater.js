    "mtitle":"Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn",
    "review":"Harley Quinn quietly broke up with the Joker, got a job, and got a place. But Gotham doesn't know the volatile couple has ended their relationship.  She has kept it quiet because being the Joker's girlfriend has given her protection.  After hearing friends say she will always go back, Harley decides to make the break-up public by blowing up the Ace Chemical plant leaving her J chain behind. While investigating another murdered scene committed by the Crossbow Killer, Detective Renee hears about the plant's explosion. With the plant in ruins, Roman wants his crew to bring Harley Quinn to him.  He gives his second-in-command, Victor, and his newly appointed driver Black Canary orders to get Cassandra Cain from lockup.  Cassandra Cain is a young pickpocket; she picked Victor's pocket.  Inside his pocket was a 30+ carat diamond.  But Roman doesn't want the diamond, he wants the information etched inside.  It has the banking numbers to Gotham's wealthiest crime family. Roman agrees to give Harley a chance to find Cain but he won't make it easy.  He put a bounty on Cassandra's head for 1/2 a million dollars, giving Harley plenty of competition. Before the dust settles, Harley will be elbow deep in laxatives, will protect her sentimental objects, and will form the Birds of Prey.<br/><br/>Most of the history between Harley and Joker is explained.  But if you haven't seen the Suicide Squad, most of the subtle jokes will go over your head.  You will have to keep your eyes and ears open for these jokes, some clever ones throw in the dialog and scenes. While watching these women kill, maim, and disfigure, they still have conversations about shoes, hair ties, and nail polish.  But DC fans shouldn't worry, Harley Quinn hasn't gone soft. This movie continues the darkness of DC comics, with a world of guns, drugs, and blood.  See this movie in theaters to enjoy the choreography of the fight scene.  And be on time.  Harley narrates here early life before the Joker, leading you to a deeper understanding of her flawed relationships.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Rhythm Section",
    "review":"Lisa, an addict and prostitute, lays down the prices for her next client, Keith. He knows her true identity.  She is Stephanie Patrick.  Three years ago, her entire family was killed in a plane crash. The accidental crash was a cover-up.  Truthfully, there was a bomb on the plane to assassinate liberal Muslim reformer, Abdul Kaif.  Everyone else on the plane was collateral damage. The government knows a college student named Reza created the bomb but covered up the terrorist attack.  They hope Reza can lead them to the orchestrator of the assassination, U-17. Stephanie looks through Keith's evidence and finds information about Reza.  She purchases drugs and a gun, then looks for him.  When she is face to face with Reza, she can't kill him. Later, she discovers Keith was murdered.  She takes his evidence and goes on a mission to find the people responsible for killing her family.  She will need training, money, and bloodlust.<br/><br/>Based on a novel, this movie just doesn't capture your attention.  While realistic about Stephanie's fighting prowess and ability to kill, Stephanie's kills are all by accident or happenstance.  She was able to use her gift of language to find U-17 but not investigate the cover-up.  This movie tries to have Kill Bill moments, Atomic Blonde fight scenes, and the intelligence of Red Sparrow but it all falls short.  It does have the sex appeal of Anna.  This movie should have been available on FandangoNow or Lifetime.  For now, it can be skipped in the theaters.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Gentlemen",
    "review":"Raymond comes home and gets a bottle of liquor when he hears ice rattling behind him.  It's private investigator Fletcher.  Fletcher was hired to find dirt on Raymond's boss, Mickey, for 150,000 pounds.  Fletcher has found a score of information and turned it into a script.  If Raymond pays in 20 million pounds, he can have the script.  Raymond is annoyed by Fletcher but offers to hear him out.  Fletcher starts with his boss Big Dave.  Big Dave hired Fletcher to get dirt on Mickey because Mickey snubbed him at a party in front of some very influential people. Mickey is ready to give up the marijuana business and retire from the mobster lifestyle.  He has decided to sell his operation to Matthew for 400 million. When word gets out that Mickey is going to retire, Dry Eye comes to Mickey to strike a deal.  Mickey thinks Dry Eyes' offer is disrespectful and unapproved by his boss Lord George.  Then, Mickey gets bad news.  One of his stash houses has been robbed and the video is streaming online as a rap video. Mickey knows the underworld sees his retirement as a weakness and everyone is gunning for him, his wife, and his business.  And that's just half of Fletcher's story.<br/><br/>In true Guy Ritchie storytelling, it's not over until it's over.  You have to be at this movie on time or you will miss crucial parts of the setup.  Of course, you can't trust what you see because Fletcher is telling a story for the 1st half of the movie.  The second half is told in real-time and has everyone one-upping each other.  This movie will become an instant cult classic while leaving an ending for part two.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Last Full Measure",
    "review":"On September 9, 1999, Scott is stuck in DC traffic. He gets a call that his boss is retiring, leaving his job as a Pentagon staffer up in the air. He leaves his wife, Tara, in traffic and jumps on the metro. Scott sits and reads is daily packet and meets with is 11 o'clock appointment. It's Vietnam Air Force Vet Thomas Tully. Decades ago, Tully applied for William Hope Pitsenbarger to receive the Medal of Honor. After an investigation, it was downgraded to an Air Force Cross. Tully believes this is wrong. Staff Sargent Pitsenbarger was an Air Force Pararescuemen who was on a mission to airlift injured army men out of the battlefield in Vietnam in mission Abilene. When the first man is pulled up, Pitsenbarger realizes it's the Army medic. Pitsenbarger knows the men on the ground will need help to get the others to safety. When the last helicopter was about to fly off, they told Pitsenbarger to get back on the plane. He sent up one more man, signaled them to leave him, got a gun, and prepared for battle. He lost his life for men he never met. To get the Medal of Honor, Scott knows you need 3 things. Pitsenbarger is only missing the approval from the chain of command. Scott starts his investigation and sees the toll the war has taken on these men but he sees their courage in trying to honor their fallen comrade. When Scott's job is at risk because of political football, can he overcome his fear to get Pitsenbarger his medal before his father, Frank Pitsenbarger, dies of cancer?<br/><br/>n a time veterans are fighting for decent healthcare, this movie will make you want to stand up for them. The physical and emotional scars are presented to the viewer for shock and compassion. Each man has worked tirelessly for decades to obtain the Medal of Honor while coping with loss, regret, pain, and PTSD. Their constant disappointment in this country is reflected the moment they see Scott. They believe he is another puppet sent to sweep Pitsenbarger's valor under the rug. When he shows his true dedication to the project, it allows him to open his heart and fight it through to the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dolittle",
    "review":"John Dolittle gained a following as the man who could talk to animals. His following grew so large, the Queen of England asked him to help her. She rewarded him with a manor to care for all animals. And the manor would be his for life. While working on the animals, he meets Lily. They fell in love and worked at the manor helping animals far and wide. One day, Lily went on a mission to find an exotic tree with a berry that could heal any ailment. On her mission, her boat was destroyed and she died. John retreated behind the walls of Dolittle Manor with a handful of animals and refused to come out again. Years later, Tommy Stubbins is forced to go hunting with his uncle and cousin. In an attempt to miss a duck, Thomas shoots a squirrel. He brings the squirrel to Dolittle Mannor for John to treat. Lady Rose and Thomas are greeted by Chee-Chee the gorilla. Overcoming his distrust of people, John’s instincts take over to save the squirrel. In amazement, Lady Rose explains her presence at Dolittle Manor. The Queen of England has fallen ill, she wants John to come and help her. If she dies, he will lose the manor. John laughs and reminds Lady Rose that he owns the manor for life. Lady Rose corrects his misunderstanding. He owns the manor for Queen Victoria’s life, not his. John’s dog examines the Queen and smells something strange on her breath. With John’s help, the dog identifies the smell as Nightlock, a poisonous flower that kills days after consumption. John has to recover the berry, his wife died trying to find, to save the Queen’s life and his manor.<br/><br/>This movie is more related to the book than the other Dr. Dolittle movies. In a great shot, you go through the looking glass and see John speaking to the animals in gorilla, macaw, octopus, and dog speak as Lady Rose and Thomas look on during the squirrel’s surgery. The viewer understands Dolittle isn’t speaking English and the animals magically understand him. He is speaking their language and it’s being translated on screen. The jokes are cute but they aren’t memorable. For the parents, the movie is safe for kids and not too scary. Also, there are no songs. Stay pass the first end crawl but not to the very end. See this one in the standard format.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
