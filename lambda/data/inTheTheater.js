    "review": "Frida will waitress at the KingTech Gala and cyberstalks the host, Slater King on her phone. Her roommate, Jess, asks Frida for Jess's favorite lighter and the rent. Frida hands Jess the lighter but wants more time for rent money.<br/><br/>Frida drools over Slater while working. Frida sees Slater across the room and builds the courage to talk to him. Frida knocks down a server, breaks her heel, and cuts her hand while falling. Slater rushes over to help Frida, and they talk all night. Then, Slater returns and asks Jess and Frida if they want to vacation on his private island. They say yes and get on a private plane with Slater and his friends.<br/><br/>After they arrive, Slater remembers Frida doesn't have luggage. So, he assures Frida that there are clothes in her room. Frida changes in the bathroom, finds a Desideria perfume, and spays herself. A maid enters Frida's room and calls Frida Red Rabbit.<br/><br/>For days, everyone drinks, eats, does drugs, and laughs. While lounging poolside, everyone hears Jess's screams. A viper bit her. Slater kills the snake and tells Jess she will be okay.<br/><br/>Frida pulls Jess aside after breakfast because she can see Jess is upset. Jess wants to leave because she thinks something is wrong. Frida doesn't understand. Jess begs Frida not to disregard her feelings. Frida sighs and promises to leave with Jess.<br/><br/>Frida tours the island alone and finds a room full of red bags. Frida opens a door and frightens the maid. The maid gives Frida a bottle of green liquid and tells Frida to drink. Frida happily swallows and begins to choke. She questions the maid about the drink's contents. Frida drank snake venom.<br/><br/>The men go fishing while the women have spa treatments in the morning. Frida sees one of the women pull out Jess's lighter. She asks them for Jess's whereabouts, but no one remembers Jess. Frida's memory flashes back to assaults the night before. She remembers Slater killing Jess. Then she hears a knock at the door. It's Sarah with Jess's lighter. Sarah admits she doesn't feel comfortable on the island but doesn't know why. Frida gives the venom to Sarah to drink. Sarah recollects the horrors she endured. They must get off the island before Slater discovers they have their memories back.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a necessary trigger warning for sexual assault survivors and resources. The scenes are hard to watch as the women's memories flood back but deliver the needed anger for the impending revenge. The audience will see this island has a cult vibe. The women are dressed the same and say a similar phrase, 'I'm having a great time.' This repetition is a necessary slow burn to disorient the viewers and put you in the women's state. The last 20 minutes is the bloody and brutal revenge. For some viewers, this movie won't be a thriller. It will be a horror with a slow build. The film has a second twist, which is the ultimate payback. While this movie is intriguing, one viewing is enough to stick with you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Forge",
    "review": "Cynthia returns home and summons her son, Isaiah, to the kitchen. He hasn't cleaned his room, taken out the trash, or done his laundry. Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Crow",
    "review": "Shelly gets a call from Zadie. Their friend, Dom, recorded their last night together and texted it to Zadie. Zadie wants to use it against the CEO of ROEG, Vincent. However, Zadie sees someone following her and believes Shelly is in danger too. Shelly panics and runs out of her home. She bumps into a cop, and drugs in her purse fall out. The judge sends Shelly to a rehab center.<br/><br/>She sees a young man, Eric, and sits with him. Shelly glances through Eric's art and hears her name over the P.A. system. No one knows Shelly is there. It's her mother, Sophia, with Vincent's right-hand woman, Marion, and several other goons. Eric helps Shelly escape them and the rehab center.<br/><br/>Shelly and Eric hide out and continue their intense love affair. Eric asks Shelly to play the piano. She does but has a horrific flashback. Sophia had Shelly perform for rich people, and they made Shelly do horrible things. Since then, she couldn't stomach playing.<br/><br/>Shelly and Eric dance at a club, and Shelly goes to the bar for a drink. Dom tells Shelly someone murdered Zadie. He believes the killer is coming for them next. Shelly tells Eric they must leave, but she must retrieve her phone first. They go to the loft, and several men attack them. They put bags over Shelly and Eric's heads and make them face each other. They watch each other suffocate.<br/><br/>Eric wakes up in a trainyard with a spirit guide, Kronos, watching over him. He explains that Eric is dead and Shelly is in hell. Their killer made a deal with the devil to send innocent souls to hell. And, in turn, their killer will remain immortal. Eric can fix this. If Eric kills his murderer, then he will reset the balance and get Shelly back. Kronos says the crow will lead Eric to his killers. Can Eric save the love of his life?<br/><br/>Viewers should not see this movie if they expect a remake of the 1994 film. Based on The Crow by James O'Barr, this plot focuses on the love story between Shelly and Eric for the first half. Also, this picture is more supernatural than its predecessor. The fight scenes are a bloody, gruesome cringe-fest reminiscent of Blade. This film is perfect for a matinee viewing but will turn off fans who desire the cult classic with better graphics.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Rob Peace",
    "review": "Robert DeShaun Peace sits on the porch and waits for his father, Robert 'Skeet' Douglas, to pick him up. Robert's mother, Jackie Peace, gives Skeet a brief hello and hugs her son goodbye. Skeet praises Shaun's love of math and urges Shaun to use it for the community. Shaun loves spending time with Skeet, but this will be the last day of Shaun's childhood.<br/><br/>The police arrest Skeet for murdering two women after an argument. Three years later, a jury finds Skeet guilty and sentences him to life in prison. Jackie knows Skeet's murder conviction will follow Shaun, so she decides to put him in a private school after elementary. She sits Shaun down and explains that he should go by the name Robert so people won't discover what Skeet did.<br/><br/>Shaun, now Robert, works hard at St. Benedict Prep School and impresses the principal, Reverend Edwin. However, no one knows Robert is secretly working on Skeet's case. He discovered the original trial violated the 6th Amendment and now gets a hearing. The judge agrees with Robert's argument and frees Skeet but gives the state 30 days to appeal. Days later, the state wins and puts Skeet back in prison to serve the rest of his life sentence. Robert continues to study, work, and focus on Skeet's case until he hears Jackie scream. Robert got into Yale University. Robert wants to use his degree to improve the community and help his father, but Jackie warns Robert. She thinks standing by Skeet and East Orange will bring Robert down. Robert will attend Yale in the fall and help the community. This decision will bring his promising future to a heartbreaking end.<br/><br/>Based on The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace: A Brilliant Man Who Left Newark for the Ivy League by Jeff Hobbs, this movie embodies the crab mentality. Robert reaches a fork in the road when Jackie wants him to leave, and Skeet wants Robert to beg, borrow, and steal to save him. The director used the backing track, news, and costumes to set the period. Also, the lighting and camera angle changes when Robert confronts Jackie compared to him and Skeet. This film is an emotional rollercoaster because you want Robert to succeed, but you know the ending. This picture is a must-see, but parents should know it has drug use and some foul language. However, it teaches a worthy lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Long ago, an alien race known as the Eridian created a vault on Pandora. It has power and knowledge inside. But only a person with Eridian blood can open it with three keys. Atlas, the CEO of Atlas Corporation, believes his daughter, Tiny Tina, is an Eridian descendant. Atlas sends his soldier, Roland, to save Tina and bring her to him. Roland goes rogue and saves Tina with the help of an imprisoned psycho, Krieg.<br/><br/>Bounty Hunter Lilith brings her latest catch to a bar on the planet, Cytherea. Atlas has his men deliver a message. He wants Lilith to find Tina and hands her a beacon to summon him when she does. Atlas pays her, and she agrees.<br/><br/>Lilith arrives on Pandora and shoots something in the distance. It jokingly screams because it's an indestructible robot named Claptrap. Lilith wants to leave the robot behind until she learns it can access the ECHOnet. Lilith gives Claptrap a photo of Tina and asks it to scan the net for any sightings. Claptrap quickly locates Tina.<br/><br/>Lilith drives to Tina's last location and uncovers her hiding spot. When Tina discovers Lilith is there to return her to Atlas, Tina and Krieg attack. Their battle alerts Atlas's army to their position. Roland rides in and grabs Tina, Lilith, Krieg, and Claptrap.<br/><br/>Tina explains that Atlas doesn't love her. He only wants her because she can open the vault. When she does, he will use the knowledge to create weapons. Lilith decides to help Roland and Krieg save Tina. Can these scoundrels save Tina from Atlas and find the vault to save Pandora before Atlas takes control?<br/><br/>The movie has comical moments but won't make you laugh out loud. It has action but nothing new. Also, the twist is very predictable because the script plants blaring clues. This film is for the video game lovers who don't skip the dialog. It's a new adventure in a vibrant world but a forseeable premise. The only reason to see this movie in theaters is for the graphics and fight scenes. Otherwise, wait for a streaming service.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
