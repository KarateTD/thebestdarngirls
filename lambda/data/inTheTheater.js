    "review":"Venom must snack on chickens and chocolate because Eddie won't go looking for bad guys to eat.  etective Mulligan calls Eddie into the precinct because the infamous serial killer, Cletus Kasady, wants to talk to Eddie only. At the prison, Cletus asks Eddie to print a message on the front page.  Eddie agrees before he leaves, but Venom slows Eddie down.  Venom notices something on the walls of Cletus's cell.  In the drawing, Venom discovers the burial site of several of Cletus's victims. The city lifts the moratorium on executions, and the state will execute Cletus in a few days.  An upset Cletus writes a postcard to Eddie. Cletus blames Eddie for his execution and wants Eddie to witness it. Face to face, Cletus and Eddie get into an argument, and Cletus angers Venom.  Venom attacks Cletus, and Cletus bites Eddie.  Cletus can taste something different about Eddie's blood and ingest it.  At the execution, Cletus's body starts to fight the chemicals, and he lives. Cletus and Carnage come up with a quid-pro-quo.  Cletus can kill Venom, but only if Carnage helps Cletus find one person: Frances.  With Cletus on the loose, Eddie will need Venom to fight.  Too bad he and Venom broke up.<br/><br/>This movie continues with all the laughs and violence you expect from Venom.  While the plot strengthens the relationship between Venom and Eddie, it offers another love story with a bloody third wheel and a red wedding.  And let's not forget Venom's coming out party. The sound may take some deciphering, but the visuals are top-notch.  It never gets too cartoonish or too realistic. With so much action in this twisted love story, viewers will get a glimpse into part three.  And only stay past the first set of end credits for a universal collision.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rookie, Valerie Young, and her riding partner, Sergeant Mitchell, drop their lunch break for a rowdy fight outside a casino. When Young tries to get a handle on the situation, a man sucker-punches her.  She tases the man, and Young and Mitchell take him to the police station.  The man is Teddy Murretto, and he will be in lock up for a while.  Later, Mitchell gets a call about an abandoned unmarked police cruiser with bullet holes on the side of the road.  As the cops investigate the scene, a drunk driver hits the car and almost kills the cops. They book him as John Doe and put him into another holding cell.  After a throat-closing incident, Young comes down to check on the men.  She finds out that Teddy is a con-man that chose to get locked up to keep himself safe.  However, this was an ill-calculated move.  Across from John Doe, Teddy recognizes the man.  His real name is Bob Viddick, and he is a contract killer.  Viddick got himself locked up to complete the contract on Teddy.  Before the night is over, Young will have to decide who she can trust: a professional, a psychopath, a crooked cop, or a con-man.<br/><br/>This movie takes a second to get started, but it's necessary to set up all the pieces in the game, like Mouse Trap.  Once all the players, plots, and bullets are in place, the knockdown, drag-out fight begins.  Be aware there are no wasted moments on screen.  The broadcasts, backstories, and jokes have a point to the overall plot. This movie takes its time, but it's worth every second to see these opposing forces battle it out.  Based on the ending, maybe we will get a part two.  Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cry Macho",
    "review":"A year ago, Howard fired Mike, a 5-time rodeo winner, from his promotion.  Now, Howard needs a favor.  Thirteen years ago, Howard met Leta at a party, and the two had a son, Rafael. Now, Howard learned that Leta and others abuse Rafael. So, Howard asks Mike to go to Mexico and bring Rafael to him in Texas.  When Mike says no, Howard threatens to stop financially supporting him.  So, Mike heads to Mexico and travels to Leta's compound. Leta tells him that Rafael is a dangerous, cock-fighting teen who's unfindable.  Howard ignores Leta but hears a clue in her words.  He goes to the local cockfight and finds Rafael hiding after the police leave the scene.  He grabs Rafael's rooster, named Macho, and convinces Rafael to leave with him.  But it won't be that easy to get Rafael to Texas.<br/><br/>Based on Cry Macho by N. Richard Nash, this movie is proof that some books shouldn't be movies.  In the long, and often unnecessary, lulls, your mind will wander.  Now, there is a sweet love story, but it's not needed to get Rafael home.  It's for Mike's closure.  If you have HBO Max, watch it there.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings",
    "review":"Shaun works as a valet with his best friend, Katy, and any chance they get to lollygag, they take it. They talk on the bus about their futures and their family's expectations.  A man approaches Shaun and tells Shaun to give him his pendant.  Shaun refuses, and the gang of men fight. With unstable motion, the bus knocks out the driver.  Katy gets into the driver's seat during the fight.  Together, Katy and Shaun save the passengers and fight off the men.  But they take Shaun's pendant. He tells Katy that he has to find his sister, Xialing, and save her from their father, Wenwu.  This detail stuns Katy because she never knew Shaun had any family.  He tells Katy that he is getting on the next flight to see Xialing, and Katy doesn't hesitate to go with him.  On the flight, Shaun explains that his name is Shang-Chi.  And love, pain, and revenge blanket his family history. For thousands of years, Wenwu grew power exponentially thanks to the ten rings he found or stole, depending on which legend you believe.  Then, Wenwu learned of a forest called Ta Lo with mythical creatures that possessed unknown strength. He travels to Ta Lo and finds a beautiful woman, Jiang Li. Jiang Li protects Ta Lo and all its strength.  The two fell in love and tried to stay in Ta Lo, but they ex-communicated Jiang Li and stripped her of her powers.  After Jiang Li died, Wenwu raised Shang-Chi to be an assassin while developing the ten rings gang.  When Shang-Chi turned 16, Wenwu asked Shang-Chi to avenge his mother.  Shang-Chi left and never came back.  Now, Shang-Chi must save his sister before Wenwu comes for her.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the synopsis because there is still more story to go.  The brief overview is only 30 minutes into the movie. This movie separates itself with a storyline that doesn't focus on good or evil but grief and loss.  In the beginning, everything is more realistic, but as the story delves deeper into Ta Lo, it becomes more magical, like Dr. Strange. The graphics are the best yet for the MCU, and the bus fight scene is one of the best. It puts Captain Marvel and Spider-Man to shame.  And let's never forget the fight between Wenwu and Jiang Li.  Their combative dance of love and power is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
