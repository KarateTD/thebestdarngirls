    "review": "ROZZUM Unit 7 1 3 4 is an assistance robot from Universal Dynamics. It activates on a remote, uninhabited island and looks for a task. The wildlife and terrain become a challenge. So, ROZZUM puts herself in observation mode for several days. She learns about the ecosystem and animal linguistics. When she is at 100%, ROZZUM turns on and looks for her owner to give her a task. ROZZUM enters a bear cave while searching. The bear, Thorn, wakes and chases ROZZUM. ROZZUM escapes by slipping and crushing a bird's nest. ROZZUM looks under herself and finds a dead goose and several broken eggs. Only one is intact. A fox, Fink, steals the egg to eat it, but ROZZUM stops him. ROZZUM sends a distress beacon so the manufacturers can locate her, but the gosling breaks it. An opossum, Pinktail, sees ROZZUM struggling with the tiny bird and explains that it thinks ROZZUM is its mother. ROZZUM leaves the gosling behind to find a task. Pinktail tells ROZZUM that her task is to get the gosling some food, teach it to swim, and teach it how to fly before winter. ROZZUM's programming activates, and she cares for the gosling.<br/><br/>ROZZUM crosses paths with Fink again while acquiring food for the gosling. Fink tells ROZZUM to give up because it's a runt and wasn't supposed to survive. However, ROZZUM refuses to accept this because it's her task. Later, Fink tells ROZZUM to name the young bird. She calls the gosling Brightbill and tells everyone to call her Roz. Over months, Roz, Fink, and Brightbill become a family, but Brightbill can't fly and is a weak swimmer. Brightbill finds other geese during a swimming lesson, but they exclude him because a 'monster' raised him. Roz feels guilty and ventures around the island. She finds several broken ROZZUMs in a cave. She disconnects its return beacon, steals it, and returns to Brightbill to complete her tasks. She must teach Brightbill to fly. After several attempts, an elder goose, Longneck, promises to take Brightbill under his wing for the migration. But Roz has to get Brightbill ready in a week. Can Roz and Fink get Brightbill prepared for the winter migration?<br/><br/>Based on The Wild Robot by Peter Brown, this movie gives a caring and unapologetic view of parenting. However, it offers it from a wildlife perspective. Fink wants her to give Brightbill his independence, but she wants him to be independent while closer to her. Roz excels beyond her programming when she experiences love. The audience should know that the movie goes beyond the migration. Roz's time with Brightbill helps her become a mother. However, something more makes her a wild robot. The storyline is compelling and unique. The voice actors deliver the lines with emotion and perfect comedic timing. And the graphics are astounding. Viewers should keep an ear open for the A-1 13 reference. The film is on a cliffhanger because it's book 1 of a series. Also, there is a short but funny post-credit scene.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Orion Pax sneaks into the Cybertron Archives to find recordings about the Matrix of Leadership. The first Primes died in a battle against the Quintessons, and the Matrix was lost. Since its disappearance, the Energon stopped flowing naturally, and Cybertronians are born without their transformation cog. Without the ability to transform, Energon miners, like Orion, dig below the surface to mine the resource. And their leader, Sentinel Prime, searches the surface for the Matrix. Security guards find Orion and chase him out of the archives. Orion jumps out of a window, and his best friend, D-16, saves him.<br/><br/>D-16 and Orion dig with their co-worker, Jazz, and captain, Elita-1. During their dig, an explosion traps Jazz, and Elita-1 tells Orion and D-16 to leave him and follow protocol. But Orion won't listen. He convinces D-16 to save Jazz. They do, but cause a cave-in. Then, Sentinel Prime makes an announcement. The miners will get the day off for Iacon 5000.<br/><br/>Orion and D-16 walk to the race, and Orion pulls D-16 into a secret entrance. D-16 grins at the starting line until Orion straps a jetpack to their backs. They enter the race and nearly win before losing miserably. However, Sentinel Prime congratulates them for motiving the mining bots. After Sentinel Prime and his second-in-command, Arachnid, leave, a racer furiously barges into the room. They caused him to crash, and he punishes them. He dumps them to level 50.<br/><br/>B-127 can't believe he has guests. Then, B-127 introduces them to his 'friends.' Orion accidentally knocks into B-127's 'friend,' and a chip falls out. It plays a message from Alpha Trion. He is in battle and gives their final location. Orion believes that's where they will find the Matrix. He convinces D-16 and B-127 to come to the surface to find the Matrix. They uncover so much more.<br/><br/>This origin story plays into the best friends becoming mortal enemies clich√© but is highly entertaining and feels original. The story has jokes for parents without making sexual innuendos. The film has action and astounding storytelling. Also, they don't force a romantic storyline. This film is about the creation of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. There is one mid-credit scene and one post-credit scene. The graphics could be better, but the story makes up for the visual pitfalls. See this movie with the entire family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Joe Flood creeps around a theater in Budapest to find his target. He takes out the target, but the target's guards fight the theater's security team. The prima ballerina, Maize, sprints and pulls out her phone. The stampede knocks her down and stomps on her hand and foot. Joe grabs Maize's phone, puts it in his pocket, and carries her to safety.<br/><br/>Joe sees the doctor and reports he has headaches and double vision. After tending to Joe's wounds from Budapest, the doctor does a CT scan. Joe goes to his handler, Zvi, to collect his paycheck. Zvi tells Joe to find a life outside of contract killing.<br/><br/>Joe goes to Maize's dance studio to return her phone. Maize writes down her phone number and gives it to him. They fall in love, but Joe doesn't tell her about his job. After months together, Joe wants to settle down with Maize and give up the game. Zvi says it will be easy because Joe stuck to the code. He only killed amoral people, never the innocent, civilians, or children.<br/><br/>Joe gets a call from his doctor. He has Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, and there is no cure. He throws away his guns and gathers his money. Joe asks Zvi to create an insurance policy to cover Maize and use the cash to make Joe the next contract. Zvi agrees to help Maize but won't issue the contract. Joe goes to Antoinette and asks her to start the contract at midnight. She scrolls through the app and informs assassins that Joe Flood is worth $2,000,000.<br/><br/>Joe returns to Budapest, breaks up with Maize, and goes home. He leaves Maize a message explaining his illness and gets a call from his doctor. The lab made a mistake and switched his results with someone else's. Joe looks at the clock, and it's 2 minutes before midnight. Joe prepares.<br/><br/>Joe takes out Goyang and his gang. He calls Antoinette and tells her to cancel the contract. She refuses and doubles the payout. He updates Zvi and goes on the run. Joe doesn't know how many hitters are after him, but they better pack light. Joe Flood won't give up without a fight.<br/><br/>Based on The Killer's Game by Jay Bonansinga, this picture has wit, wild fights, and romance. The director captivatingly combined Joe's hits with his love story. The scene flips from Joe putting a necklace on Maize to him strangling a guy from behind. The graphics-heavy combat opens the door for comical dialog. Also, it introduces the characters in fun and unique ways. So keep your eyes open for names on the screen. This piece is a laughable and murder-filled good time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Psychic Medium Lydia halts the taping of her show, Ghost House, after seeing Betelgeuse in the crowd. She runs to the bathroom and opens her pill bottle. Her boyfriend, manager Rory, chases after her. Then, Lydia gets several urgent texts from her stepmother, Delia.<br/><br/>Lydia runs to Delia's latest art installation and gets woeful news. Lydia's father, Charles, died. Lydia calls her daughter, Astrid, but she won't answer. Astrid believes her mother is a fraud because Lydia can't see her dad, Richard. Lydia, Delia, Astrid, and Rory arrive at the original Ghost House in Winter River. They have a funeral for Charles, and Delia shrouds the house in black cloth for a grief collective. During the wake, Rory proposes to Lydia, and she reluctantly agrees. Astrid leaves in disgust, jumps on her bike, and narrowly escapes death by crashing through a fence and into a tree. A boy, Jeremy, sees her from his tree house and runs down to help. The two connect and make plans to meet before the wedding.<br/><br/>In the afterlife, Betelgeuse manages a call center. He gets a call from Ghost Detective Wolf Jackson because someone accidently reanimated Betelgeuse's ex-wife, Delores. Betelgeuse tells them he married Delores, thinking he found the love of his life. He didn't know she was a witch who traded immortality for taking people's lives. She poisoned Betelgeuse on their wedding night. Before the poison took effect, he killed her. Now she is traveling through the afterlife, sucking the souls out of anyone standing in between her and Betelgeuse. He believes marrying Lydia will save him from Delores.<br/><br/>Before the wedding, Astrid roams to the attic and finds the town model, a Betelgeuse flyer, and a photo album with pictures of Richard. She questions Lydia about the flyer and says Betelgeuse's name twice. Lydia pulls Astrid out of the attic and forbids her from going inside. Later, Lydia walks into the attic, and Rory finds her. He believes Betelgeuse is a figment of her imagination and says the name three times. Betelgeuse acts as their marriage counselor before Lydia and Rory escape. She relocates Betelgeuse to her past until Astrid gets in trouble and enters the afterlife. Lydia will say the three words that put fear in her heart. Will she regret it?<br/><br/>This sequel has callbacks from the first with songs, outfits, and art but tells a unique tale. Lydia kept her ability to talk to ghosts and now uses it to make a living. Delia moved beyond sculpture and now uses her body as a canvas. On the surface, the movie is about Lydia, Delia, and Astrid escaping Betelgeuse. However, it's about bringing Lydia and Astrid together because Astrid doesn't understand Lydia's love for her. Viewers will get a new possession song and dance while laughing with their favorite bio-exorcist. Also, the audience learns more about Betelgeuse before his death in a foreign-film-style retelling. They also get an animated version of Charles' death and the Soul Train. Fans of the original movie will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Curtis and Meridith raise three children. While Meridith works on her doctoral thesis, Curtis is in marketing. Cal is a sweet young boy who loves tickles, but Preston is nervous about attending school. Their oldest, Iris, loves her boyfriend, Sawyer, and dreams of going to Standford in the fall.<br/><br/>Curtis meets with his boss, Marcus. They have a client who created a new digital assistant, Aiah. Melody, Sam, and Lightning introduce Curtis and Marcus to Aiah. Aiah is a large language model digital assistant with a hub and cameras. As the assistant lives with a family, it adapts and caters to their needs. They want Curtis to understand their product. So they offer to install it for free.<br/><br/>Curtis invites Melody into their home. She sets up the Aiah hub while her crew places Aiah's eyes around the house. Curtis introduces his family to Aiah, and she greets them. Aiah scans the home and sees dirty dishes on the table. Aiah offers Cal and Preston points for completed chores. They can trade their points for screen time. Meridith and Curtis stand in stunned silence as Cal and Preston run to the table and clean. Meridith and Curtis think Aiah is a dream. However, Aiah is a nightmare in disguise.<br/><br/>Scary AI isn't a new genre in movies, but this one uses the people around it to do its evil bidding. It will lie, kill, cheat, and manipulate to get what it wants. This film combines an obsessed person with a microchip. Aiah machine learning doesn't have guardrails to bind her actions. This issue is a common mistake in AI development. This movie is M3GAN without the doll and a few jump scares. It leaves room for a sequel, but the plot won't encourage you to see a part two.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
