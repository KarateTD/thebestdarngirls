    "review":"In the 17th century, the Outworld wants to end the Mortal Kombat competition before it begins. By killing Hanzo's bloodline, they can ensure defeat in Mortal Kombat and take over the Earthrealm.  With Hanzo, his son, and his wife dead, Bi-Han leaves with a feeling of accomplishment.  However, before the face-off between Hanzo and Bi-Han, Bi-Han's wife hid their daughter.  Knowing Hanzo is dead, Raiden comes to Earth and rescues Hanzo's daughter.  Today, Cole battles in an MMA cage match. After losing, yet again, Jax approaches Cole and asks him about his dragon logo.  Cole's daughter tells Jax the logo is his birthmark. Cole and his family eat at a diner, and it starts to snow, but Cole points out that it's July.  Then they see Sub-Zero freezing the world around them.  Jax pulls up in his car and yells at them to get in.  Jax tells Cole that his birthmark is a champion's mark, and Jax has the same marking. So, Jax gets out of the car, gives Cole a name and address, and allows Cole to leave with this family while he fights Sub-Zero. Sonya invites Cole inside her bunker and explains that the Earth is in danger.  In the last 9 Mortal Kombats, the Outworld reign supreme.  If they win again, the Earth and everyone on it will become a slave to the Outworld.  This battle to the death will force Cole to face his past, gifts, and destiny.<br/><br/>Based on the popular game Mortal Kombat, this movie offers lots of graphics and battles to feast your eyes upon.  However, the writers' breeze through the history of Mortal Kombat so quickly, you could miss it if you cough. The script tells these impactful points in less than 15 seconds.  This movie makes up for its flaws with an eye-catching final fighting scene with a nod to the game.  The final image left the possibility for a part two, but viewers shouldn't keep their fingers crossed for that.  And don't stay after the end credits.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Together Together",
    "review":"Matt and Anna sit across from each other as he asks her probing questions.  Matt decided to become a father using his sperm and a donor egg. However, he must interview candidates to carry his child. At first, he shows concern because Anna had a child but gave it up for adoption. But Matt pushes his reservations aside and chooses Anna.  With no support from her estranged family, Anna becomes a surrogate on their third try. Through the three trimesters, the love in their arrangement helps them form a bond and grow individually.<br/><br/>Consider this to be a romantic comedy without lovers.  It's easy to see how the plot could make them lovers, but the writer lets you know this is an arrangement that develops into a friendship. And be prepared to laugh at the awkwardness of their lives in everyday situations like a baby shower, birthing class, and group therapy.  This movie is a combination of Seinfeld and Juno.  If that's your type of humor, this is one to see but not buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Voyagers",
    "review":"Earth is heating up, and humans must find another hospitable planet.  They find a suitable second Earth, but it will take 83 years to travel there.  Richard suggests that scientists breed a crew from other scientists, raise them indoors and in isolation, and train them to sustain the ship.  The crew's grandchildren will be the ones who reach the new Earth. Richard launches into space with a crew of kids whose grandchildren will make it to the new Earth.  For ten years, everything goes well until the computer tests positive for toxic chemicals in the plant water.  Since the plant water is filtered urine, Christopher wonders what's wrong with them.  As the crew sleeps, Christopher and Zac search the database for the unknown compound in their urine causing the positive reading.  They learn the compound blocks their desires and makes them dull and docile. They determine the chemical compound is in their daily-required drink that they call \"The Blue.\"  Zac and Christopher decide to stop drinking it, and they feel everything for the first time, including anger, jealousy, and lust. When Zac sees Richard touching Sela's shoulder, he is furious. The next day, Richard and Zac prepare to go outside to repair the spacecraft, but recent unacceptable behavior makes Richard choose Christopher to help him.  During the repair, a shadowy figure moves past Richard, and he screams in pain.  Christopher pulls Richard inside, and the medical team tries to help him, but it's too late. As the new captain, Christopher's act is to find out what happened to Richard.  Zac thinks it's an alien, but Christopher isn't so sure.  On the hunt for the truth, the crew will divide into two factions: the believers and the non-believers.  After blood and accusations, only one will come out on top.<br/><br/>This futuristic rendition of Lord of the Flies takes some time to get interesting, but it does after the crew breaks down.  As the movie progresses, it changes from an alien plotline to a whodunit.  With well-crafted sets and costumes, you will dive into the plot.  But parents, if you are watching with your teens, be prepared to be uncomfortable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"French Exit",
    "review":"Frances sits with her advisor as he delivers dreadful news: all her money is gone.  She has no idea what to do next.  He tells her to sell everything in the home and use the cash to start a new life.  She drinks her woes away when her son, Malcolm, walks into the room to find her drunk. He got engaged to Susan, and they want to live together. But Frances tells Malcolm her news first, and, much to Susan's chagrin, Malcolm halts from telling the truth about his engagement.  When Malcolm tries to tell Frances again, she cuts him off with more news: a friend offered to let Frances and Malcolm stay in her apartment in France.  Malcolm keeps quiet. Frances, Malcolm, their cat, and thousands of dollars get on a cruise headed to France.  Before Frances' \"French Exit,\" she will allow a private investigator, a clairvoyant, a new friend, an old flame, and a fiancé to stay in this cozy apartment.  She will connect to her husband and reveal a horrific end for her vacation.<br/><br/>Based on French Exit by Patrick deWitt, this dark comedy provides unusual laughs at uncomfortable situations.  You will dream of having Frances' bravado in everyday life.  While this movie is entertaining, you won't have an urge to buy it.  But if you don't like dark comedies or rich people's problems, this isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Godzilla vs. Kong",
    "review":"It's been years since Kong defeated King Ghidorah, and now Kong continues his life on Skull Island. Monarch, with Dr. Ilene's guidance, monitors Kong's movements, diet, and attitude.  Also, Dr. Ilene cares for a little girl named Jia.  Jia is the last surviving member of the Iwa tribe. Others warn Ilene that Kong has outgrown the enclosure.  They need to move him, or they won't be able to contain him.  Ilene worries that moving Kong will awaken Godzilla.  In Pensacola, Florida, Apex Cybernetics has a mole with a Titan Conspiracy podcast named Bernie.  He downloads files and uses them to expose the work at Apex. As he delves deeper into the files, Godzilla attacks the Apex compound. Outside, no one understands why Godzilla is attacking Apex.  In the past, Godzilla only attacks when provoked. Madison listens to Bernie's latest broadcast about the attack and runs to her father, Mark Russell, who lost his wife, Emma, in the previous Monarch attack.  Madison tells Mark about the podcast and Godzilla's history, but he doesn't listen.  Madison decides to find Bernie to track Godzilla's reason for attacking Apex.  But Apex's CEO, Walter Simmons, doesn't want to know why; he wants to stop Godzilla.  He goes to Dr. Nathan and requests his help.  Walter wants Nathan to go to Hollow Earth, the Titan's home. Walter created the Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle or HEAV for short, and it can withstand the reverse-gravitational effect.  And to find the Titan's source of power, they will need a titan, Kong.  With Kong as a divining rod, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan will travel to Hollow Earth to save the world from Godzilla.  But Bernie, Madison, and Madison's friend, Josh, discover that Godzilla isn't the biggest dog in the yard.  Who will come out on top?<br/><br/>Talk about a movie that gets to the point.  You came to see two titans fight, and you won't be waiting for long.  First, they battle at sea, then on land. With so much focus on the titans, the humans were subplots and obstacles for the hero to overcome. The graphics become cartoonish when the titans are on screen alone.  But when they interact with each other or humans, the CGI gets better.  See this movie on the tallest screen possible, whether that's in a theater or at home, and don't stay past the end credits.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
