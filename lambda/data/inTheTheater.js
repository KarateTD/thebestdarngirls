    "review":"After Maisie freed the dinosaurs, the humans and animals must find a way to co-exist. Claire forms the Dinosaur Protection Group to save them from poachers, breeders, and dinosaur fighters. She reports the violators to the authorities, who send the animals to Biosyn. Biosyn created a sanctuary in Italy for the animals and now researches them to develop pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>Doctor Ellie Sattler arrives at a cornfield infested with locusts. The bugs are enormous and carry a genome from the Jurassic era. Ellie uncovers the locusts didn't ravage the neighbor's crops and ask why. The farmer tells Ellie the neighbor uses Biosyn seeds.<br/><br/>At a dig site, Ellie catches up with Doctor Alan Grant. He looks over the insect after catching up with Ellie. He determines that her suspicions are correct and the bug is genetically modified. Ellie believes Biosyn created the insects to manufacture a global food crisis with their crop being the only food source. Ellie wants to go to Biosyn and investigate for evidence. Ellie tells Alan not to worry because she has a friend on the inside: Dr. Ian Malcolm.<br/><br/>On the outskirts of Alaska, Claire and Owen privately raise Maisie because the world knows she released the dinosaurs. Maisie sees a small velociraptor in the woods with Blue's markings. It's Blue's child, but Maisie can't figure out how Blue had a baby with no males around. She names the small velociraptor Beta and feeds it.<br/><br/>As Owen surveys the property, he hears Blue's cries for help. He sees Rainn, a poacher, kidnapping Beta. Owen looks up and sees a woman grabbing Maisie and pulling her into a van. Owen runs home to tell Claire that Beta and Maisie are gone, and they prepare to help. Owen explains to Blue that the kidnappers have his kid too. He promises to bring Beta back, and Blue roars and leaves. Rainn stole Beta and Maisie with a purpose. Doctor Henry Wu needs them and their genetic makeup to fix his mistake and save the planet. The past and the future will collide to reveal the evil plan behind the lies of benevolence that is Biosyn.<br/><br/>The screenwriters attempted a massive feat by bringing the franchise's past and present characters together along with the dinosaurs. It does help to watch Jurassic Park, Jurassic World, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom to understand each character's backstory and the movie's easter eggs. With Now This News commentary, the film attempts to give a brief overview of the prequel's major plot points, but you don't get an understanding of the character's arcs. The CGI department created thrilling new dinosaurs and improved fan favorites. This movie falls flat because it's the same underlying story: two lost kids are inside a business with no respect for mother nature. This movie is thrilling, but nothing will top the first.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Andy wakes from a nightmare to see his daughter, Charlie, sitting in the kitchen, playing with a lighter.  She tells him that she is experiencing weird feelings again and can't sleep.  When his wife, Vicky, wakes up, Andy makes them pancakes.<br/><br/>Later, Charlie plays dodgeball with her classmates, and her bully, Gavin, slams a ball at the back of her head.  Charlie runs to the bathroom and turns on all the faucets.  Then, an explosion comes from Charlie's stall.  The principal and the police want answers about how Charlie caused the explosion.<br/><br/>Andy starts to pack their things to go on the run again.  He worries that DSI will come after them after Charlie's explosion.  Charlie overhears the conversation and wants to know about DSI.  During college, Vicky and Andy participated in an experiment for a chemical called LOX-6.  It gave Andy the ability to control people's minds and Vicky the power to move objects.  Charlie becomes increasingly upset and accidently sets Vicky's arms on fire.  Andy bandages Vicky's arms and makes plans to leave the next day.  To calm Charlie down, Andy takes Charlie out for ice cream.<br/><br/>They come home after their sweet tooth run, and Charlie admits that she meant to hurt Andy.  When Andy sees pictures off the wall and glass on the floor, Andy knows something is wrong.  He runs into the living room and sees Rainbird behind a pendant light with a knife at Charlie's throat.  Rainbird tells Andy that DSI sent him, and they want Charlie alive.  Then Vicky's deceased body falls to the floor.  Charlie becomes enraged and creates a blast to knock Rainbird to the ground.  Andy and Charlie go on the run, but Dr. Jane, Rainbird, and DSI aren't through with them yet.<br/><br/>Based on Firestarter by Stephen King and a remake of the 1984 cult classic Firestarter, the producers marketed this film as a horror, but it doesn't have the jump scares you expect.  With time, this remake has better graphics and special effects.  Unlike the original, the parents don't agree on rearing young Charlie.  One person wants Charlie to contain her abilities, while the other wants her to train and hone them.  While this won't be another cult classic, it has compelling special effects and solid acting from a young actress.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Doctor Strange and America Chavez run towards the Book of Vishanti with a demon chasing them.  Doctor Strange realizes the demon is too strong to stop.  There is only one way to win and save the multiverse, kill America.  Then, he wakes up in bed.  Doctor Strange is accustomed to these nightmares and brushes them off.  Today, Christine will marry Charles.<br/><br/>At the reception, Dr. Strange hears car crashes and people screaming.  He looks outside to see cars slamming by themselves.  He uses a spell to reveal a monster chasing a girl.  After Doctor Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong save the girl, Doctor Strange remembers her from his dream.  America swipes his sling ring and runs away.  Strange and Wong catch up to her, get the sling ring, and ask why the monster came after her.  She explains a demon desires to steal her power because she has the ability to jump through universes. Doctor Strange's dreams weren't dreams.  However, they were connections to the other Doctor Stranges in different universes.  Wong remembers markings on the monster, but they didn't look like any ruins they know.  They looked like witchcraft.  Doctor Strange decides to consult the strongest witch he knows: Wanda.<br/><br/>As Strange discusses the multiverse with Wanda, she says America's name.  Strange freezes because he never said it.  Wanda sent the creatures after America.  Wanda acquired the Darkhold and used it to move between universes to steal America's powers.  Once she has America's abilities, she can be in another universe with Billy and Tommy forever.  She gives Doctor Strange until sundown to bring America to her, or Scarlet Witch will come for them.<br/><br/>This movie kicks down any preconceived notions about the movie or the multiverse.  Before watching this film, you should watch What If, WandaVision, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange.  While you won't get that awe-inspiring, stand up and cheer moment fans get with the other movies, you have a good time. You should know this is one of the most ruthless and bloody films in the MCU.  The graphics are stunning and look better in 3D.  And there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After finishing his last contract early, Alex goes to Mauricio with plans to retire.  Mauricio laughs and reminds Alex that contract killers like them don't stop.

After completing the job, Alex looks at the list and sees someone added a young woman, Beatriz.  When he goes to kill her, Alex sees she is a young girl and leaves the room.

    "review":"King Aurvandill returned from war and walked into the arms of his wife, Queen Gudrún, and son, Prince Amleth.  Aurvandill worries about his wounds and thinks it's time to prepare Amleth to take the throne.  Gudrún thinks Amleth is too young, and Aurvandill's brother, Fjölnir, should take it.  But Aurvandill disagrees and goes through with the ceremony.  Afterward, a group of masked men attacks Aurvandill.  Amleth watches as Fjölnir takes off his hood, declares the throne his, and kills Aurvandill.  Amleth runs to find Gudrún, but he is too late.  He runs to the river, gets in a boat, and paddles away. He declares that he will avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir.<br/><br/>Years later, Vikings saved and raised Amleth.  After a brutal win, the Vikings take the women and men hostage for enslavement and kill the children.  Amleth learns the Vikings will take the slaves to Fjölnir to enrich his kingdom.  Amleth has a vision that his revenge nears.  He gives himself the mark of a slave and sneaks onto the boat heading for Iceland.  Olga, an enslaved woman, knows Amleth is a Viking.  He tells her his noble origin, and she tells him she is a sorceress.  She will use her gifts to aid Amleth if he frees her.  Amleth is on a path to revenge served bloody.<br/><br/>Based on the legend of Amleth, this film depicts the horrific events that inspired Hamlet.  Amleth learns that one's legacy isn't always linear.  It hides ugly truths and generational pain, and the plot foreshadows Amleth's dark legacy but through the eyes of a witch.  The set designers' and customers' meticulous attention to detail is noticeable.  However, with that level of attention, the disgusting horrors of war are painfully accurate.  Skip this film if depictions of torture, assault, and child abuse trigger you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
