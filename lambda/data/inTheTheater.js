    "review":"Three years ago, creatures crawled out of a sinkhole and killed 95% of the human population in a month. The surviving humans call them Reapers and can't kill them. Humans discovered that the Reapers wouldn't go above 8,000 feet. So, they migrated there and created settlements.<br/><br/>Today, Will raises his son, Hunter, on the Rocky Mountains Settlement in Colorado. He lost his wife, Tara, to a Reaper and now raises Hunter alone. During the night, Hunter's alarm rang because his breathing apparatus needed a new filter. Will replaced it but doesn't have another. Without the filter, Hunter will die. Will believes the Boulder Hospital will have boxes of them and creates a plan to descend to retrieve them, but he needs help.<br/><br/>Will walks to Nina's cabin and tells her his plan. She laughs because no one survives a Reaper attack. Will points out that Nina lived. Nina is a physicist from Caltech. She hypothesized a way to kill the Reapers but needed a chemical from her lab. Nina, Tara, and several other people descended to get the items. Nina was the only person who returned. Although Will blames Nina, he needs her to get through them. Nina comes with her Reaper locator. Tara's best friend, Katie, stops them as Will and Nina get extra bullets. She refuses to let Will go without her. They will use the Calway Mines to the Boulder Hospital. He can get the filters for Hunter and save Hunter's life. Can they make it without awakening the Reapers?<br/><br/>This post-apocalyptic thriller ends with a cliffhanger. Will, Nina, and Katie are on different missions but on the same path. Will wants to save his son, Nina desires to help the world, and Katie wants to assist Will. They understand it's a suicide mission but continue on the journey. The plot's antagonist is the Reapers. However, the mid-credit scene points to a larger plan or a part two. The ill-created visual effects are distracting and make the film less scary. This film has the makings of a cult classic, but part two will likely be on a streaming platform.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A realtor walks a newlywed couple, Al and Rose Young, around a house and shows them the large dining room, living room, and kitchen. She states the price is $3400, and Al gags. He only expected to pay $3000. However, the realtor states Al's G.I. bill will help them. Before Al ponders further, Rose says she's pregnant. Al chooses to buy the home.<br/><br/>Rose gives birth to Richard and has two more children, Jimmy and Elizabeth. Years later, Richard brings his girlfriend, Margaret, home to meet his parents. Rose pats Margaret's hand, stands up, and tells her to focus on her dreams because time won't wait. Richard asks Margaret to spend the night here. She wants to spend the rest of her life here. 'Here' has been many things to many people.<br/><br/>Based on Here by Richard McGuire, this movie's plot centers on the Young family. However, the timeline stretches from prehistoric days until now. The scenes overlay like photos in a scrapbook during pivotal moments to make the connection. The camera doesn't change angles until the last 10 seconds. This spot has a place in history and with each family. It goes through birth, life, and death. This director and editor stayed faithful to the source material and made the movie identical to the graphic novel. This picture isn't for you if you don't like a nonlinear story. This movie will be in film classes for years to come.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Tobias finishes a promo video for his employer, Weetabix. He returns to his room and opens his divorce papers. He finds a pencil, but the tip breaks off. Desperate to sign the document, Tobias leaves the room in his bathrobe and walks to a convenience store. He buys several pens and a chocolate orange. Tobias strolls to his hotel and bends down to pick up a dropped orange slice. He wakes up in a hospital with Almut sitting across from him. Almut admits she hit Tobias with her car.<br/><br/>Almut and a heavily bandaged Tobias eat at a 1950s American-styled diner. She is a Bavarian fusion chef and upcoming restauranteur. Her place will open in a few days, and she invites Tobias to come with his wife, pointing at his wedding ring.<br/><br/>Tobias arrives at the restaurant, and Almut has him reserved at a table for two. He only needs a table for 1. Tobias sits, eats, and experiences bliss. Almut comes over to hear his opinion and notices he's alone. They go to Almut's apartment and spend the night together. It's the first night of the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>This story is in a nonlinear narrative. It starts with Almut going on a run, gathering eggs from their chickens, and cooking breakfast for Tobias. Then, they are holding hands in a doctor's office and discussing treatment. Next, the story recalls the first day Tobias and Almut met. The audience sees who they became after they struggled as a couple. The storytelling is compelling even when the plot slows. This movie is more than a rom-com. It's a celebration of love through perseverance.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars",

    "mtitle": "Conclave",
    "review": "Cardinal-Dean Thomas Lawrence joins the other Cardinals by the Pope's bedside after the Pope suffered a heart attack and died. He questions Archbishop Woźniak about the Pope's final hours. Cardinal Tremblay interrupts with a detailed list of the Pope's interactions.<br/><br/>The College of Cardinals arrives at the Vatican to choose a new Pope, a Conclave. Lawrence greets each Cardinal and pulls Cardinal Bellini aside to tell Bellini he will vote for Bellini as the new Pope. However, Bellini believes some of the Cardinals will vote for Lawrence. Lawrence admits he wanted to quit, but the Pope refused his resignation.<br/><br/>Before sequestering, the Cardinals make last-minute arrangements. Cardinal Lawrence's assistant, Monsignor Raymond O'Malley, runs to him with pertinent information. An unknown Cardinal, Benitez, arrived with proper documentation to prove his selection. The Pope secretly made Benitez a cardinal because Benitez worked in Kabul. Then, a drunken Woźniak comes to Lawrence. Before the Pope died, he met with Tremblay. The Pope demanded that Tremblay resign after discovering devious information. Lawrence will search for the candidates' scandals to ensure Bellini's win while running the conclave. After Lawrence gets the same number of votes as Bellini, Bellini wonders if Lawrence is a man after power, not the truth.<br/><br/>This movie starts slow, with traditions, laws, and order. The mystery is compelling, but the rituals will bore the audience after the first vote. Rumors spread about finances and secret relationships as the cardinals argue over conservative values versus liberal ones. Soon, each candidate endures a smear campaign and must clear their name or step down. This film saved itself in the last 5 minutes. The final secret will leave you in awe.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars",

    "review": "Venom makes Eddie a drink while the news plays in the background. The police issued a warrant for Eddie's arrest. They believed he murdered Patrick Mulligan. Eddie must leave town now. Before they go to New York, Venom needs a snack. They find dog fighters for Venom to munch. They don't see human and alien surveillance following them.<br/><br/>Doctor Teddy Payne gets a text message from General Rex Strickland stating they are bringing the subject to Area 51. She races to the military facility. Teddy looks Patrick in the eye and calls the alien inside him. Toxin warns Teddy and Rex that Knull is coming to kill everything on the planet, and the black one is the key. Rex sends the Air Force to find Eddie and Venom.<br/><br/>Venom and Eddie hitch a plane to New York. Venom envelops Eddie's body to comfort Eddie. Then, a Xenophage jumps on the plane and attacks. The Xenophage is looking for the Codex. When a symbiote returns its host from the dead, it and the host become one life force. That life force creates a key called the Codex. Knull sent the Xenophage to find the Codex. Knull created the symbiotes and Xenophages. However, Knull became evil, and the symbiotes imprisoned Knull with the Xenophages. The Codex is the only thing that can free Knull. The only way to destroy the Codex is if one of them dies.<br/><br/>Eddie and Venom travel the Nevada desert until Rex finds them and starts shooting. Venom takes form and attracts the Xenophage. Eddie and Venom escape together, but Eddie has innocent blood on his hands. Eddie and Venom must escape the San Francisco police, the Air Force, and Knull's Xenophage without one of them dying.<br/><br/>he final installment of the Venom series combines the first and second plots. The writers make several jokes, but you won't laugh out loud. The graphics flow and don't distract the viewer from the story. And the audience can feel the struggle and bond between Eddie and Venom. There is a mid-credit scene to expand this multiverse's MCU, but the post-credit scene answers a question no one asked. This film is a fitting end to the series, but it's equally good as the others.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
