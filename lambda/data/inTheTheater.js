    "mtitle": "Joker: Folie à Deux",
    "review": "The guards at Arkham Asylum give Arthur Fleck a clean shave and suit before he meets his lawyer, Maryanne Stewart. Maryanne prepares Arthur for a conference with his court-appointed psychologist. The psychologists believes Arthur has a split personality that he calls Joker after suffering years of abuse. If they can get the court to accept it, Arthur will spend his life in a mental facility instead of a prison for murdering five people. The guards lead Arthur to B-ward, and he hears singing. Arthur peeks inside and glances at a beautiful woman with an angelic voice. Arthur finishes his psychiatric evaluation, but Maryanne knows this strategy is a long shot. Arthur goes back to his cell. During yard time, a guard, Jackie, got Arthur some time in the B-ward's music class. Arthur can't contain his excitement.<br/><br/>Arthur sits next to the woman. She tells him her name is Lee. He inspired her. She grew up in the same building as him and had an abusive father. She watched Arthur on The Murray Franklin Show and wanted Arthur to shoot him. Then, he did. That's when Lee felt seen for the first time. The guards pull Arthur away, but he is smitten with Lee.<br/><br/>Arthur watches District Attorney Harvey Dent give a press conference about Arthur's trial. Judge Herman Rothwax deemed Arthur fit to stand trial. And Harvey wants Arthur to get the death penalty.<br/><br/>B-ward's music class watches a musical. Lee gets up, walks to the piano, sets it ablaze, and sits in her seat. When people spot the fire, they run. Lee grabs Arthur, and they flee in the other direction. The guards grab Arthur and throw him into the hole until his trial.<br/><br/>One day, Lee awakens Arthur. She bribed a guard to let her into the hole to say goodbye to Arthur. However, she plans to be at Arthur's trial daily. She paints Arthur's face, and they make love in the hole.<br/><br/>Arthur enters the courtroom but looks back at the door during the opening statement. He beams with glee when Lee enters and sits in the back. After the first day of deliberations, Lee confronts Maryanne in the vestibule. Lee thinks Maryanne is mocking the Joker and losing the trial. Lee says the world is on Joker's side and will free him.<br/><br/>Lee goes to the holding cell and tells Joker that Maryanne will lose the trial. Maryanne meets with Arthur about the trial. He professes his love for Lee, and Maryanne laughs. She reveals that Lee is a liar. Her name is Harley Quinzel, and her parents are rich. Arthur confronts Lee about her lies, and she confesses. She lied because she wanted Joker to like her. She wants him to let Joker free. Arthur takes her advice and fires Maryanne. Joker will represent himself and make the world smile. Will he be found guilty and sent to death?<br/><br/>This musical sequel is an ambitious change from the first film. Arthur and Lee perform songs, together and apart, to express their feelings. However, the movie stays grounded when the real world bleeds into the music and dance. The costume designers ensured the world around Arthur was gloomy and gray. But Joker's world had spots of color. The storyline does an excellent job of recapping the first film. The plot slows down for the songs, and sometimes the music drowns out the actors. However, the film is worthwhile. The audience will watch Arthur Fleck's trial and Joker's birth.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Megalopolis",
    "review": "Architect Cesar Catilina is the chairman of the Design Authority and wants to use his invention, Megalon, to build a city called Megalopolis. Megalon is a bio-adaptive material that he believes is the future. However, Mayor Franklyn Cicero stands in Cesar's way. Cicero and Cesar confront each other during a press event. Cicero's daughter, Julia, watches the face-off from afar. She grows tired of Cesar embarrassing her father. She wants to expose Cesar.<br/><br/>Cesar returns home and asks his mistress, reporter Wow Platinum, to stop watching her interview with Hamilton Crassus the third, owner of Crassus National Bank. She professes her love for Cesar and wants to marry him to start the new phase of her life. However, he doesn't share her sentiment. Ms. Wow must create a new plan and Hamilton is the key player.<br/><br/>Julia cons her way into Cesar's office. Julia and Cesar have a battle of wits. But she leaves him speechless when she confesses that she saw him stop time during a demolition. Julia is immune to Cesar's powers, so he hires her as his assistant and shows her around his lab to see his vision. Cicero wants to keep an eye on his daughter and the womanizer.<br/><br/>Cesar's cousin, Clodio, sits in the background with seething hatred for Cesar. He loves Julia, but she sees him as a friend. Clodio's uncle, Hamilton, sees Clodio as a party boy and a disgrace to the family name. Clodio decides to be a man of the people to gain their trust, become a politician, gain Hamilton's respect, and end Cesar. Can Cesar complete his vision with enemies surrounding him?<br/><br/>This movie brings Rome into the third millennium of America. The characters wear futuristic togas and laurels while celebrating debauchery and virginity. However, this movie is 1 hour too long. It tries too hard to be stunning and provocative but is confusing and disjointed. The cinematography is for the big screen, but the script is for streaming. The actors did a masterful job with what the writer gave them. But they couldn't save this film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Wild Robot",
    "review": "ROZZUM Unit 7 1 3 4 is an assistance robot from Universal Dynamics. It activates on a remote, uninhabited island and looks for a task. The wildlife and terrain become a challenge. So, ROZZUM puts herself in observation mode for several days. She learns about the ecosystem and animal linguistics. When she is at 100%, ROZZUM turns on and looks for her owner to give her a task. ROZZUM enters a bear cave while searching. The bear, Thorn, wakes and chases ROZZUM. ROZZUM escapes by slipping and crushing a bird's nest. ROZZUM looks under herself and finds a dead goose and several broken eggs. Only one is intact. A fox, Fink, steals the egg to eat it, but ROZZUM stops him. ROZZUM sends a distress beacon so the manufacturers can locate her, but the gosling breaks it. An opossum, Pinktail, sees ROZZUM struggling with the tiny bird and explains that it thinks ROZZUM is its mother. ROZZUM leaves the gosling behind to find a task. Pinktail tells ROZZUM that her task is to get the gosling some food, teach it to swim, and teach it how to fly before winter. ROZZUM's programming activates, and she cares for the gosling.<br/><br/>ROZZUM crosses paths with Fink again while acquiring food for the gosling. Fink tells ROZZUM to give up because it's a runt and wasn't supposed to survive. However, ROZZUM refuses to accept this because it's her task. Later, Fink tells ROZZUM to name the young bird. She calls the gosling Brightbill and tells everyone to call her Roz. Over months, Roz, Fink, and Brightbill become a family, but Brightbill can't fly and is a weak swimmer. Brightbill finds other geese during a swimming lesson, but they exclude him because a 'monster' raised him. Roz feels guilty and ventures around the island. She finds several broken ROZZUMs in a cave. She disconnects its return beacon, steals it, and returns to Brightbill to complete her tasks. She must teach Brightbill to fly. After several attempts, an elder goose, Longneck, promises to take Brightbill under his wing for the migration. But Roz has to get Brightbill ready in a week. Can Roz and Fink get Brightbill prepared for the winter migration?<br/><br/>Based on The Wild Robot by Peter Brown, this movie gives a caring and unapologetic view of parenting. However, it offers it from a wildlife perspective. Fink wants her to give Brightbill his independence, but she wants him to be independent while closer to her. Roz excels beyond her programming when she experiences love. The audience should know that the movie goes beyond the migration. Roz's time with Brightbill helps her become a mother. However, something more makes her a wild robot. The storyline is compelling and unique. The voice actors deliver the lines with emotion and perfect comedic timing. And the graphics are astounding. Viewers should keep an ear open for the A-1 13 reference. The film is on a cliffhanger because it's book 1 of a series. Also, there is a short but funny post-credit scene.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Orion Pax sneaks into the Cybertron Archives to find recordings about the Matrix of Leadership. The first Primes died in a battle against the Quintessons, and the Matrix was lost. Since its disappearance, the Energon stopped flowing naturally, and Cybertronians are born without their transformation cog. Without the ability to transform, Energon miners, like Orion, dig below the surface to mine the resource. And their leader, Sentinel Prime, searches the surface for the Matrix. Security guards find Orion and chase him out of the archives. Orion jumps out of a window, and his best friend, D-16, saves him.<br/><br/>D-16 and Orion dig with their co-worker, Jazz, and captain, Elita-1. During their dig, an explosion traps Jazz, and Elita-1 tells Orion and D-16 to leave him and follow protocol. But Orion won't listen. He convinces D-16 to save Jazz. They do, but cause a cave-in. Then, Sentinel Prime makes an announcement. The miners will get the day off for Iacon 5000.<br/><br/>Orion and D-16 walk to the race, and Orion pulls D-16 into a secret entrance. D-16 grins at the starting line until Orion straps a jetpack to their backs. They enter the race and nearly win before losing miserably. However, Sentinel Prime congratulates them for motiving the mining bots. After Sentinel Prime and his second-in-command, Arachnid, leave, a racer furiously barges into the room. They caused him to crash, and he punishes them. He dumps them to level 50.<br/><br/>B-127 can't believe he has guests. Then, B-127 introduces them to his 'friends.' Orion accidentally knocks into B-127's 'friend,' and a chip falls out. It plays a message from Alpha Trion. He is in battle and gives their final location. Orion believes that's where they will find the Matrix. He convinces D-16 and B-127 to come to the surface to find the Matrix. They uncover so much more.<br/><br/>This origin story plays into the best friends becoming mortal enemies cliché but is highly entertaining and feels original. The story has jokes for parents without making sexual innuendos. The film has action and astounding storytelling. Also, they don't force a romantic storyline. This film is about the creation of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. There is one mid-credit scene and one post-credit scene. The graphics could be better, but the story makes up for the visual pitfalls. See this movie with the entire family.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Joe Flood creeps around a theater in Budapest to find his target. He takes out the target, but the target's guards fight the theater's security team. The prima ballerina, Maize, sprints and pulls out her phone. The stampede knocks her down and stomps on her hand and foot. Joe grabs Maize's phone, puts it in his pocket, and carries her to safety.<br/><br/>Joe sees the doctor and reports he has headaches and double vision. After tending to Joe's wounds from Budapest, the doctor does a CT scan. Joe goes to his handler, Zvi, to collect his paycheck. Zvi tells Joe to find a life outside of contract killing.<br/><br/>Joe goes to Maize's dance studio to return her phone. Maize writes down her phone number and gives it to him. They fall in love, but Joe doesn't tell her about his job. After months together, Joe wants to settle down with Maize and give up the game. Zvi says it will be easy because Joe stuck to the code. He only killed amoral people, never the innocent, civilians, or children.<br/><br/>Joe gets a call from his doctor. He has Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, and there is no cure. He throws away his guns and gathers his money. Joe asks Zvi to create an insurance policy to cover Maize and use the cash to make Joe the next contract. Zvi agrees to help Maize but won't issue the contract. Joe goes to Antoinette and asks her to start the contract at midnight. She scrolls through the app and informs assassins that Joe Flood is worth $2,000,000.<br/><br/>Joe returns to Budapest, breaks up with Maize, and goes home. He leaves Maize a message explaining his illness and gets a call from his doctor. The lab made a mistake and switched his results with someone else's. Joe looks at the clock, and it's 2 minutes before midnight. Joe prepares.<br/><br/>Joe takes out Goyang and his gang. He calls Antoinette and tells her to cancel the contract. She refuses and doubles the payout. He updates Zvi and goes on the run. Joe doesn't know how many hitters are after him, but they better pack light. Joe Flood won't give up without a fight.<br/><br/>Based on The Killer's Game by Jay Bonansinga, this picture has wit, wild fights, and romance. The director captivatingly combined Joe's hits with his love story. The scene flips from Joe putting a necklace on Maize to him strangling a guy from behind. The graphics-heavy combat opens the door for comical dialog. Also, it introduces the characters in fun and unique ways. So keep your eyes open for names on the screen. This piece is a laughable and murder-filled good time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
