    "review":"Jim works on his cattle ranch but fell behind on his mortgage after his wife died of cancer.  The bank will auction it in 90 days if he doesn't come up with the money. At the border fence, Jim almost hits a young boy with his car.  Then Jim sees a woman grab the young boy and limps away.  He yells at the woman to stop and states that she won't make it with her injured leg.  He offers to call border patrol, and they will take her to the hospital.  Rosa begs Jim not to call border patrol and help her and her son, Miguel, get to a safe place.  She offers to pay.  But Jim refuses to take her money and calls border patrol.  Border patrol tells Jim it will take some time to get to them, and Jim notices a black SUV come to the fence.  Maurico gets out of the SUV and tells Jim to hand over Rosa and Miguel. Maurico stops being nice, pulls out a gun, and starts firing.  Jim returns their fire, pulls Rosa and Miguel into his car, and drives off. He fires more shots, but Jim gets away.  Jim notices Rosa has a bullet wound in her abdomen.  Jim pulls over to help her, but he can see she won't make it.  Rosa tells Jim to take all she has and take Miguel to his relatives in Chicago. When border patrol arrives, Jim hands Miguel over to the authorities, and one is his stepdaughter, Sarah. Worried, Jim stays at the headquarters, and he spots Maurico waiting. Jim knows that Maurico will kill Miguel in Mexico, so Jim breaks Miguel out of headquarters and plans to drive him to Chicago.  Maurico and his men are on their tails.  They will bribe, hack, or kill anyone or anything in their way.<br/><br/>This movie is News of the World, Taken, and John Wick rolled into one.  The movie touches on immigration, medical cost, and the treatment of veterans and ranchers. As for the action, there is nothing new nor exciting about it.  It's the connection between Jim and Miguel that pulls you into the story.  Other than that, it's 100% predictable and typical.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Diana works at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as a senior anthropologist. She sees a woman picking up papers scattered all over the floor and bends down to help her.  The woman introduces herself as Barbara Minerva, a geologist and gemologist that likes cryptography.  As Diana walks away, Carol walks in looking for Barbara.  While investigating a jewelry store robbery, police uncovered the store was a front for selling black market antiquities.  The FBI will bring the items to the museum for Barbara to analyze.  As Barbara looks over the items, Diana comes to check things out.  They notice a unique looking stone, but it has a marking Barbara can't understand.  Diana recognizes the language and tells Barbara it says hold it and make a wish.  Diana holds it and makes a wish, and then she invites Barbara to an early dinner.  Later, Diana holds the stone on her desk and wishes to be more like Diana.  The next day, Carol brings their latest platinum donor, Max Lord, on a private tour.  He notices the stone in Barbara's office and wants to know more about it, but Barbara stops him.  He invites Barbara and Diana to a party in his honor for his donation. Diana goes to the party looking for Max.  Max finds Barbara and goes to her office to make out.  In the middle of the session, he asks to borrow the stone for a few days, and she says yes.  As Diane searches for Max, a man calls out to her and says, 'I wish we had more time.'  She turns in blistering anger and tells him not to say that.  It slowly sinks in that her wish came true, and Steve's ghost is in another man's body.  She forgets about Max and focuses on Steve.  This focus is a mistake.  Max runs Black Gold Corporation and advertises it on TV, and while it may look successful, it's a ponzi scheme. But he doesn't wish for his company to succeed, but he makes a wish to become the stone. Diana goes to Max's office and finds dust.  She sees a metal ring that once held the stone and sees an engraving on the inside.  The stone came from the God of Lies. He is granting wishes for his gain.  Diana must find and destroy him before Max destroys the world.<br/><br/>Sequel to Wonder Woman, this movie has all the hair, shoulder pads, and greed of the 1980s.  Many who have seen this movie complain it doesn't have a villain.  But they fail to realize, in the 1980s, greed was at an all-time high. So, greed is the ultimate villain.  The fight scenes are well choreographed and framed perfectly for each shot.  And let's mentions Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  The look on his face is priceless. It does help to see the first movie to catch the little tidbits from the first.  With all the strong points, the film runs too long.  The romance between Steve and Diana takes up too much time. Some of the CGI turns the movie into a cartoon and takes away from the viewing experience.  This movie is watchable for those willing to enjoy a DC movie, not a DC movie compared to Marvel.  And stay after the first end-credits for a blast-from-the-past cameo.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"One night a week, Cassie goes to a club and pretends to be falling-down drunk.  She waits for a guy to pick her up, take her home, and try to rape her.  Before the assault, Cassie tells the guys, 'I'm sober, and I could hurt you.'  At work, a man recognizes her from college.  His name is Ryan, and he's a pediatric surgeon.  They were both pre-med at Forrester University until Cassie dropped out.  Ryan wants to know why, but Cassie won't divulge.  As they talk, he mentions he still talks to their old classmates, including Al Monroe.  That name makes Cassie extremely curious and angry because she thought Al was in London.  Ryan explains Al is back in town to get married, and he became an anesthesiologist after college.  She goes home and looks up Al and several other people, and then creates a Kill Bill worthy revenge list.  And she does it all for Nina.<br/><br/>It doesn't take much to figure out who Nina is and what happened to her.  So, the plot doesn't take the time to explain that.  It follows Cassie's path of rage as she plays pied piper to so-called nice guys.  But her point isn't to murder, but to teach and warn them. But she never has a real plan until she hears Al's name.  She goes from devious to cunning.  She doesn't only go after the man who attacked Nina, but Cassie goes after the ones who let him get away with it.  And once she gets to Al, she has so much more planned for him, and you will love it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd reads the news for 10 cents a person in 1870 Wichita Falls, Nebraska.  As he travels to the next town, Kidd sees a man hanging in the woods with a sign nailed to his body that reads 'Whites Only in Texas.'  Behind the body, Kidd sees someone run from an overturned buggy.  He chases after the runner and sees it's a little girl.  Inside the carriage, he discovers paperwork for her.  In the paperwork, it states the girl's name is Johanna. He was journeying to return her to her aunt and uncle 400 miles away before someone lynched him.  And then, soldiers appear and start to question Kidd. They have an abandoned minor's office, and they will return her. A soldier tells Kidd that the person in charge of returning minors won't be back for three months.  Kidd can leave her there or take her with him. He decides to take Johanna to her aunt and uncle.  This ride will show Kidd a side of America he never read in the papers.<br/><br/>Based on News of the World by Paulette Jiles, this modern-day newscaster relays messages about the government, sadness, and heroism.  While he delivers the news, he doesn't sugar-coat it. On their travels, they run into a dictator, child predators, and understanding.  In the storyline, you will get a sense that Kidd is running from something.  But you won't know what it is until the last 30 minutes. In their historical context, hard-hitting topics don't feel forced or inserted to make a point.  It flows naturally.  This movie is for the big screen but not one you will want to own.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Geppetto, a poor woodcarver, states undamaged items need to be repair for money everyday.  One day, he sees a crier announcing a puppet show is coming to town.  Geppetto asks the crier what he made the puppets out of, and the crier answers wood. He hopes he can create one and become famous and wealthy.  He runs to a carver and asks him for a piece of wood for free.  The carver points at a woodblock, but Geppetto believes it is too expensive. The carver insists that Geppetto take it.  Geppetto doesn’t know that the wood started moving by itself before he got there.  The carver is happy to get rid of it.  Geppetto goes home and begins carving the wood.  He asked the wood to call him Babbo.  It speaks, leaving Geppetto awestruck.  He declares it as his son and creates an outfit out of his bedsheet.  He names it Pinocchio. After completing his legs, Geppetto tells Pinocchio he has to go to school like all the other children.  Geppetto sells his best coat to buy a spelling book for Pinocchio.  However, Pinocchio sees the puppet show on the walk to school.  After Geppetto leaves, Pinocchio ditches his classes, sells his spelling book, and buys a puppet show ticket.  The puppet master sees that Pinocchio does not have strings and decides to take the puppet.  Pinocchio wants to get back to his dad, and he will go through a ring of fire, water, and school to do it.<br/><br/>Based on The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, this is not the Disney version of the story.  It stays true to the plot without watering it down for children.  Be aware the movie is dubbed in English. Not relying on CGI was a winning aspect of this movie.  With perfectly-crafted make-up and prosthetics, their talent shines through without the cartoonish nature of CGI masking their abilities.  This second live-action version of Pinocchio is a visual masterpiece, but the story is very long-winded. It could have the same effect as a shorter plot.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
