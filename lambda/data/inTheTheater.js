    "mtitle":"Civil War",
    "review":"The President of the United States hosts a press conference to update the nation on its state. He assures the people that the Western Forces will fall. He reiterates that the Loyalist States will reign supreme after the war concludes and accept the Californians and Texans back into the United States.<br/><br/>Lee photographs water riots in New York. She sees another photojournalist get hit and pulls the journalist out of the way. Lee warns the young reporter to wear a press vest when a bomb explodes. Later, Lee meets with her colleague, Joel, in a hotel lobby. New York Times veteran journalist Sammy wants to know what they have planned next. Joel reluctantly admits they are driving to DC to interview the president. Sammy advises them to go west to Pittsburg and head towards West Virginia instead of taking a direct route. Then, Sammy asks if they can drop him off at the South Carolina front lines. Lee and Joel woefully agree. Lee sees the young journalist from the bombing in the lobby, and Jessie introduces herself.<br/><br/>Lee meets Joel at their van and shockingly sees Jessie in the car beside Sammy. Joel tells Lee that Jessie is 23 years old and green but ready. He promises to drop Jessie off at the Carolina border with Sammy. Then, they can travel to DC to interview the president. Lee obliges. This civil war will leave a lasting mark on all of them.<br/><br/>This film gives a dystopian view of America but hits close to home. Now, the script never states the president's political party. So, the writers aren't trying to make a political statement. However, this movie highlights the trauma war reporters suffer through. It's their job to report the news but never intervene. They work through shootings, bombings, and death. This film is a love letter to photojournalism.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead",
    "review":"Tanya shops with friends for their upcoming trip to Mexico. Tanya's mother, Mrs. Crandell, texts Tanya to pick up her brother, Kenny, and come home immediately. Mrs. Crandell had a nervous breakdown at work. She must attend a yoga retreat in Taiwan or risk losing her job. Tanya cancels her trip to care for her siblings, including Melissa and Zack. Before Mrs. Crandell leaves, she hires a babysitter, Mrs. Stuark, to care for the kids. Mrs. Crandell gives Mrs. Stuark an envelope of cash for food.<br/><br/>Kenny reminds Tanya that they planned a party before Mrs. Crandell left. So, Tanya tells Mrs. Stuark they will have a bible study with gospel rap music. Tanya enters Mrs. Stuark's room and finds the babysitter pale and unresponsive. Zack dials 911, but Kenny snatches the phone and hangs up. They believe the cops will blame them for the death. They place Mrs. Stuark in her car after forcing alcohol into her mouth. And they push the car into a lake.<br/><br/>After a few days, the kids run out of food. Their younger brother, Zack, remembers their mother gave Mrs. Stuark cash. Unfortunately, Kenny placed the purse containing the money in Mrs. Stuark's car before submerging it. Melissa creates a fake resum√© and social media presence while Zack coaches Tanya for the interview. Tanya will get one step into the corporate world and learn about her desires, future, and family.<br/><br/>This remake of the 1991 film has the original's foundation while making changes to incorporate today's technology and social sentiments. The characters have the same name, including Sue Ellen, but you have to watch to hear it. And original cast members make cameo appearances. This remake respects the source material while passing the torch. It's funny but not for a younger audience. While you won't run to the theaters to watch, it will be worth a BET+ free trial.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Monkey Man",
    "review":"Bobby dons a monkey mask and fights in the Tiger's Temple's underground bouts. After losing to King Cobra, Bobby argues with the owner, Tiger, over money. Bobby must have a longer and bloodier match if he wants more cash.<br/><br/>Bobby orchestrates people to pickpocket Queenie's wallet. Queenie is a restauranteur and criminal mastermind. Bobby walks to Queenie's restaurant and returns the wallet. Queenie offers him rupees for her troubles, but Bobby wants a job instead. He states that he is willing to do the job no one else wants and doesn't fear getting hurt. Queenie gives Bobby the dishwasher position and tells him to stay out of her business. Bobby crossed off step one of his deadly vengeance plan. Blood will spill.<br/><br/>This movie starts with Bobby's mother, Neela, telling him about Hanuman. It's necessary to watch the beginning because Bobby's story parallels this and explains why Bobby wears the monkey mask. This movie offers gritty action, point-of-view camera angles, and the hero's journey. The plot sprinkles Bobby's need for revenge throughout the story. This film has jerky camera angles. People who suffer from motion sickness should think twice before watching. Otherwise, this movie is for action fans with a worthwhile story and eye-popping imagery. See this movie today.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire",
    "review":"Kong fights off adversaries in Hallow Earth and tries to eat the carcass, but he has an injured tooth. Dr. Ilene teaches about the Titans to her students. The Monarch has several outposts on the Earth's surface and one on Hallow Earth. On the surface, Godzilla battles other Titans attacking the Earth. As Godzilla rests in the Colosseum, a scientist pulls Dr. Ilene aside to examine the latest signals. Others want to dismiss them, but the readings are too steady.<br/><br/>Ilene's daughter, Jia, became distracted in class and drew the same symbols on her paper and desk. Jia informs Ilene that something from Hallow Earth is calling her. Ilene looks closer at Jia's drawings and realizes they match the signals. Ilene takes the information to Bernie for help.<br/><br/>Bernie runs the Titan Truth podcast and posts about his work saving the world. Ilene asks Benie to look over the signals. The signals are a distress call from Hallow Earth and could cause Kong and Godzilla to collide again. Ilene rests until she hears that Kong is coming to the surface. She will travel to the Hallow Earth Access Point to stop Kong and take him back. And Bernie insists on going and filming the events for his podcast.<br/><br/>Bernie and Ilene arrive at the Access Point, and Jia walks to the observation deck. Kong rises to the shore, and Ilene spots the damaged tooth. Trapper, the Titan veterinarian, sedates Kong, removes the tooth, and implants a new one. While Kong relaxes on the shore, Godzilla collects power from nuclear plants worldwide. Ilene believes Godzilla is charging himself for round two. They must bring Kong to Hallow Earth and find the source of this signal before Kong and Godzilla battle again. Dr. Ilene, Trapper, Bernie, and Jia will open the door to a world undiscovered for thousands of years and awaken a monster that can bring forth the second ice age. Can they save the world for humans and the Titans?<br/><br/>This movie is proof that 2024 is the year of the sequels. Godzilla x Kong doesn't disappoint its core audience. It builds on the existing storyline while expanding its world and adding new Titans. The writers understand that viewers want action and stunning graphics. So, they deliver. The CGI team allowed Kong to have emotions without looking too human. They created the other animals and Titans beautifully. The fight scenes between Titans are astounding and equally comical. While the movie is action-packed, the overall theme is discovering where you belong. See this movie if you loved Godzilla vs. Kong. Also, watch it if you didn't. It is a fun time for everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Love Lies Bleeding",
    "review":"Jackie meets JJ in his car and sleeps with him for a job. She takes JJ's business card and arrives in the morning to meet the boss, Lou Sr.. He gives Jackie a waitress job, and she humbly accepts the offer.<br/><br/>Louise, a.k.a Lou, manages Crater's Gym and notices a muscular, beautiful woman walk inside. Lou watches the woman, Jackie, work out until two men distract Lou. The gym members tell Jackie that Lou likes women and invite Jackie to accompany them. Jackie refuses and punches one guy when he gets aggressive. And he hits her back. Lou separates them and brings Jackie into her gym to ice her bruises.<br/><br/>Jackie admits that she wants to go to Vegas for a bodybuilding competition. Lou thinks Jackie can win but offers free steroids to give Jackie an edge. Jackie tells Lou about her new job, and Lou advises Jackie to quit. Lou Sr. is Lou's father, and she thinks he's a horrible person. They spend the night together, and Jackie confesses she is homeless. Lou lets Jackie stay with her.<br/><br/>Jackie and Lou meet Lou's sister, Beth, and Beth's husband, JJ, for a dinner date. When Lou sees Beth's black eye, she confronts JJ in the bathroom. She threatens JJ, but JJ tells Lou Jackie slept with him for a job. Lou can't hide her rage and screams at Jackie later. Then, Lou gets a call from a local hospital. Beth was beaten and unconscious. Lou visits Beth in the hospital and wants revenge. Jackie can't handle Lou's pain. She leaves the hospital, sneaks into Beth's home, and kills JJ. Lou gets rid of JJ's body, takes Jackie home, and cleans the crime scene. Lou wants to protect Jackie, but Jackie's rage and addiction are overcoming her senses. Can Lou keep Jackie out of jail?<br/><br/>This film starts as a mob family crime drama. It's shocking, sexy, and funny. The two leads are intriguing with their genuine backstories. Then, the script gets weird. You don't know if Jackie is hallucinating from the steroids or transforming. This movie starts with high potential but fizzles out with indie weirdness.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
