    "review":"After losing a client's death row case, a woman finds a man on Tinder. The man contacted her three weeks ago and was happy to hear from her. After the date, the two struggled over a cell phone causing the man to swerve in the road. An officer pulled them over. After an altercation, the officer shoots the woman in the leg. The man and the officer fight. The man grabs the officer's gun and shoots him. The woman tells the man they have to run because no one will understand what happened. The decision to run will affect the lives of everyone they encounter or who hears their story. They will be immortalized as Queen and Slim.<br/><br/>This whole night didn’t have to happen this way. You will become more and more exasperated as the officer and Queen keep taking the situation to a new level. While a lot is focused on their relationship’s development, you don’t learn too much about Slim. In the end, you realize you never knew the real character’s names until you hear them announced in a news report. But they will forever be known as Queen and Slim.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Frozen 2",
    "review":"Fire and water disappear from Arendelle and the wind wreaks havoc on the town. Queen Elsa gets the townspeople to safety. Grand Pabbie tells Elsa the Elemental Spirits in the Enchanted Forest want the truth to come out. Queen Elsa, Princess Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf walk to the Enchanted Forest. The mist hides the truth about Elsa's powers, Anna's strength, Kristoff's true north, and Olaf's knowledge. But can they sacrifice the world they know for the forgotten past?<br/><br/>First, you must see Frozen before you see this movie. Even though Olaf does an amazing recap, he misses some of the nuances. Second, you should see this movie in IMAX, 3D, or both if you can. This Disney movie is different because their isn't a real villain. This movie focuses more on correcting Arendelle's past with the people of Northuldra. Parents will laugh at some slick jokes while having a sense of nostalgia at Kristoff's 90s power ballad styled music video. Kids will be engrossed in the action scenes. You won't regret seeing this one in the theaters.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Andre is called to a scene with 7 dead officers and another on life support. The store owner is dead with a gun in his hand. A volt is filled with hundreds of kilos of cocaine. Andre deduces their must have been 2 shooters but they were not prepared for the amount of cocaine in the volt or that the police officers were nearby. Andre believes something went wrong for the two shooters, now they are on the run. With so much cocaine on them, Andre knows they have to stay local to convert it into cash. He decides to trap the shooters in Manhanttan by closing the tunnels, trains, ferries, and 21 bridges. To get off the island, they have to go through him.<br/><br/>Now, the first 15 minutes is used to help you understand the type of cop Andre is and the type he isn’t. The rest of the movie is a heart-pounding race to the two shooters. But keep your eyes and ears open. Everything is a clue to a bigger plan in play.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Elena tried to warn her boss the clean energy source, Calisto, she created can be hacked and used as an EMP for humans. The warning falls on death ears and her boss presents it to the CEO for release. She finds a business card for the Townsend Agency and blows the whistle on her company. In moments, she is under attack and saved by a waitress. After a bullet-ridden car chase leaves her submerged in a car, Elena is saved by Jane and Sabina. They are met by Bosley and taken to a safe house. Bosley pulls Jane and Sabina aside. She feels the assassin had too much firepower for just Elena, he must be after the Angels. The angels must protect Elena, stop Calisto from falling into the wrong hands, and save themselves. All in a day's work.<br/><br/>Based on the movie franchise and TV series, this movie is not a remake. It is a continuation of the Charlie's Angels' story. They show images and have cameos from past angels. This movie is better than expected with more focus on skills than looks. While it may not be on your gift list, it is work seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
