    "review":"Lieutenant Tom Hudner enters the locker room to greet his fellow soldiers and hears someone mumbling to themselves. Before Tom can investigate, his airmen walk in, say hello, and rib him. One soldier, Ensign Jesse Brown, is standoffish, but Tom shakes his hand. Tom attempts to get closer to Jesse, but Jesse keeps his guard up. Until Tom offers Jesse a ride home because Jesse's car broke down. Tom meets Jesse's wife, Daisy, and their daughter, Pam. Daisy invites Tom in for a beer. She worries because the U.S. government gave the airmen their first mission. They will lend air support to the Korean War. Pam makes Tom promise to watch over Jesse. A new aircraft, some backward attitudes, and heavy firefights will test Tom's devotion to his promise.<br/><br/>Based on Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice by Adam Makos, this movie stands out from other historical tellings because there isn't a bad guy. Although Jesse receives media attention for his race and naval status, he doesn't want that to define him. Only his dedication to the country. Tom is a true definition of an ally. He quickly points out others' wrongdoings and listens to Jesse with an ear of compassion, not pity. This movie will leave a tear in your eye and gives these men their due.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Strange World",
    "review":"The town of Avalonia lives in the dark ages, surrounded by mountains. Explorer Jaeger Clade believes salvation is on the other side of the mountains. So, he sets out with his crew, including his son, Searcher, to trek to the other side. Searcher notices a glowing plant on the ground and tries to touch it, but it shocks him. He wants to harvest it and learn more about it. Jaeger tells Searcher that they are on a mission to save Avalonia, not garden plants. Searcher takes a stand against Jaeger, and Jaeger asks the crew to choose sides. They pick Searcher. Jaeger goes into the unknown alone and disappears.<br/><br/>Twenty-five years later, Searcher is famous for discovering Pando, the green-glowing plant. It powers Avalonia, and the townspeople develop their technology quickly. Searcher married another harvester, Meridian, and they have a teenage son, Ethan.<br/><br/>The leader of Avalonia, Callisto, comes to Searcher's farm. They are old friends because Callisto was on Jaeger's exploration team before she defected. She tells Searcher that Pando is dying everywhere, and they need to find the source of the problem. Searcher leaves with Callisto and travels to the Pando's roots inside a sinkhole. As they descend, Meridian catches up because Ethan stowed away on the Callisto's airship. Searcher finds Ethan with their dog, Legend, and begins to scold him. Then, the airship crash lands, causing Searcher to go overboard with Legend. Meridian explains it will be easier to save Searcher with the aircraft fixed. However, Ethan sneaks away to look for Searcher.<br/><br/>Curious Searcher looks around the unknown lands and discovers creatures unlike any other. When he bumps into one, it screams like him. The brute pulls up his mask, and Searcher sees his long-lost father standing before him. Jaeger warns Searcher that everything in this strange world wants to kill them. Everyone will need each other to save Pando and Avalonia.<br/><br/>This movie's animation is off the charts with unique techniques and more profound meaning to each life form. Once you understand the full scope of the film, the style choices for each Strange World character will make sense. Of course, there is more than meets the eye, but family is the story's core. While the movie is predictable, it's funny, heartwarming, and compelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",
    "review":"A year after King T'Challa died, Princess Shuri worked tirelessly to update Wakandan technology, but she stopped trying to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb. Her mother, Queen Ramonda, is fighting a political war with the United Nations. She will never share vibranium until the world is trustworthy. Ramonda returns home to make Shuri take part in a ritual. One year after a loved one passes, you burn your funeral ceremonial robe to honor them and relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>Shuri goes to the water's edge and watches Ramonda throw her robe into the fire, but Shuri refuses. Then, they notice a man coming from the water with wings on his ankles. Ramonda and Shuri dawn spears and demand to know who he is and why he speaks to them. He says his allies call him K'uk'ulkan, but his enemies say Namor. He says that Wakanda exposed his kingdom, Talokan, to great danger when they revealed the secret of vibranium. An American scientist was able to build a device that could detect the presence of the material. They want the Wakandans to bring them the American scientist so they can kill her, or they will destroy Wakanda.<br/><br/>Okoye decides to track down Agent Ross to reveal the location of the American scientist, and she convinces Ramonda to let Shuri go with her to get Shuri out of the lab. They unapologetically convince RiRi to come to Wakanda to keep her safe from a threat of unknown strength. However, Okoye and Shuri encounter hostile agents during their RiRi rescue, and Talokan warriors kidnap two of the women. Now, K'uk'ulkan gives Wakanda two options. One: Join his fight to destroy the land dwellers before they destroy his homeland for their resources. Or two: He will drown Wakanda and everyone in it.<br/><br/>And that's act one of this gut-wrenching, exciting, and loving tribute to Marvel's beloved king. The opening scene and the title card will have everyone in tears as it pays homage to a worthy figure in life and the comics. Then the plot introduces viewers to a new world with stunning but somewhat realistic imagery. You can see how this world mirrors Wakanda. Shuri and K'uk'ulkan are two sides of the same coin. They are children dealing with generational pain and devasting loss in a homeland under constant threat. RiRi is the new kid on the block. She swears, is an open book, and, while a bit naive, has some trust issues. It should go without saying, but the costumes, makeup, and art are second to none and help you delve deeper into this history-rich mythical world. Stay for the mid-credit scene, but their isn't an end-credit scene.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lily's divorced parents, David and Georgia, call Lily separately to confirm their seating arrangements. Lily tells them they will be on opposite sides of the auditorium during her law school graduation. She hangs up the phone and tells her best friend, Wren, that the graduation will be a disaster because her parents' seats are next to each other.<br/><br/>The two knick-pick at each other during the graduation but pretend to be all smiles when they meet up with Lily. They help Lily and Wren get to the airport for their trip to Bali. After waving goodbye to the graduates, David and Georgia agree not to see or speak to each other again.<br/><br/>After a few fun days, Wren and Lily go snorkeling. When they emerge from the water, they can't find the boat. It left without them. Then, they spot a man on a small watercraft and signal for help. The man, Gede, pulls Lily on it, and it's destiny. Gede is a seaweed farmer with distribution deals all over the world, and he loves his family and wants to continue his family traditions. Lily sees Gede's passion and realizes she never felt that way about the law. She went to law school to make her parents happy but loves Bali and Gede.<br/><br/>Thirty-seven days later, David calls Georgia about Lily's email. She decided to stay in Bali, marry Gede, and help him on the farm. She wants them to come to Bali for the ceremony. Georgia and David think Lily is throwing her life and career away for a flash-in-the-pan guy. They will act happy for Lily and Gede while sabotaging the marriage. Can they end one relationship before they destroy each other? Or will common ground bring them back together again?<br/><br/>This film is a Hallmark movie on steroids. David and Georgia's comebacks and one-liners are pure comedy platinum. And the conclusion is realistic and satisfying. However, the movie is too long. The editor could cut 20 to 40 minutes out of this movie and achieve the same goal. This movie is for you if you are a fan of these leading actors or romantic comedies. Otherwise, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Black Adam",
    "review":"Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was the first self-governed city of its kind. However, King Anh-Kot enslaved the people and forced them to look for Eternium. He wanted to use the crystal to create the Crown of Sabbac. When a slave finds the crystal, the other people descend upon him. A boy tells them to back off because they shouldn't fight amongst themselves. The boy runs away with the Eternium and starts an uprising. The king kills the boy to make an example of him, but the gods save him and give him the power of Shazam. The boy, now Teth Adam, returns to save Kahndaq, but the king has the crown. They have a battle that destroys the once-luxurious city.<br/><br/>Today, the people of Kahndaq live under the rule of the Intergang. Amon learned from his mother, Adrianna, that Intergang pillages their resources and pollutes their land while oppressing the people. Karim waits in the truck as Adrianna, Ishmael, and Samir explore the caves. Adrianna finds the crown, but Intergang comes in with guns. With a gun to her head, Adrianna tells the troops she will surrender the crown. However, she reads the inscription on the ground and summons Teth Adam. Teth Adam kills all but one of the Intergang troops and saves Karim and Adrianna. The surviving troop loads an Eternium-powered rocket and shoots Teth Adam. It injures him, and Adrianna brings Teth Adam and the crown home.<br/><br/>Teth Adam's presence alerted Amanda Waller, who calls Hawkman to capture Teth Adam and imprison him. He called Doctor Fate, a man who can read the future and perform sorcery with the magical Helmet of Fate. Next, Hawkman reached out to Atom Smasher. The last member of the team is Cyclone, and she is a tornado with a 167 IQ. The newly-formed JSA flies to Kahndaq to stop Teth Adam. Yet, Teth Adam isn't their only problem. They have a deadlier force looking for the crown, and they are willing to die and kill for it. It is their birthright.<br/><br/>Congratulations to DC for making the first adult superhero movie viewers can see. Teth Adam is one of the deadliest superheroes or antiheroes the D.C.E.U. has produced. Most of the CGI is well done and flows naturally with the script. However, the smaller Adam is distracting because the head is comically too big for the body. For viewers, being at the beginning sets up most of the surprises. The dialogue and slow-motion scenes have great comedic timing and accurately display everyone's strengths. This movie has one mid-credit sequence but no post-credits. Also, it sets up the future of the D.C.E.U. and is worth watching.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
