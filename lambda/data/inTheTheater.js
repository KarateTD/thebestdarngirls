    "review":"After facing a scandal, Pastor Lee-Curtis and First Lady Trinity plan to rebuild their congregation at Wander to Greater Paths Baptist Church. They want to start a grass-roots campaign to re-open their church doors on Easter Sunday. To help facilitate the re-opening, Lee-Curtis hired Anita, a filmmaker, to create a documentary about their rise. While filming, Trinity and Lee-Curtis discover their rivals, Pastor Keon and First Lady Shakura, are opening their new church location on the same day. Lee-Curtis and Trinity go to Keon's church to convince him and Shakura to change the date. But they refuse. So, Lee-Curtis decides to move up the re-opening to 5 days away, which is this Sunday. Trinity and Lee-Curtis become a two-person show in front of Anita. But behind the scenes, Trinity slowly breaks down. The church community and her family want Trinity to stand by her man to the detriment of herself, mind, body, and spirit.<br/><br/>If you watched the previews, this movie feels like a comedy. However, that feeling is only on the surface, like Trinity's emotions. She pretends to be happy and by Lee-Curtis's side when the cameras are on. However, this movie switches between documentary style and real life. You see Trinity battling with Lee-Curtis, hecklers, accusers, and family to re-open the church. Another sad reality is how the public treats Trinity and Lee-Curtis differently after the scandal. They accost, blame, and shame her but protect, love, and forgive him. Like most independent movies, you never get a conclusion. Just self-examination. No matter what side of the church you are on, this is one to watch on Peacock and discuss, but it is not for kids.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Brian Brown-Easley stands outside Wells Fargo and thinks about his daughter and ex-wife. He walks inside and enters his information on a deposit slip. Rosa, a bank teller, calls Brian to her counter and makes small talk. He quietly asks Rosa for a piece of paper and writes a note. It reads, 'I have a bomb.' Rosa looks at her bank manager, Estel, with unbridled panic and fear in her eyes. They offer to give him money, but that's not what Brian wants. He wants Rosa and Estel to get news reporters and police on the scene. For months, Brian felt ignored and unheard. The VA and Lincoln College of Technology stole his money, and he wants the VA to pay it back.<br/><br/>Based on 'They Didn't Have to Kill Him': The Death of Lance Cpl. Brian Easley by Aaron Gell, this movie covers many topics plaguing US veterans, including homelessness, PTSD, job insecurity, and the VA.. It's painful to watch this kind man fight for the little money he had. For the soldiers that give everything for the US, it's disgusting that they have to jump through hoops to get anything back. Your heart will sink when Brian says the amount he's fighting over. Maybe, this movie will be the first step to righting some wrongs.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Evie finishes her shift for the Finding Yourself party, and her best friend, Grace, swiped some swag bags, and a DNA genealogy testing kit is inside. Evie takes the test and discovers she has a second cousin named Oliver Alexander from England. He is in New York and wants to meet her face to face.<br/><br/>Evie meets Oliver, and he explains that the Alexanders haven't heard from her side of the family since the scandal. Her great-grandmother had an affair with her great-grandfather, and she got pregnant. He ran with and raised the baby alone. Oliver says the family is having a wedding and invites Evie on an all-expenses paid trip to England. Evie isn't sure, but Oliver convinces her to go.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, Evie bumps into the staff setting up for the wedding and makes one of the women drop a box of glasses. The head butler, Mr. Fields, scolds the maid, but Evie defends her. Lord Walter walks up to Mr. Fields and explains that Evie is a guest. Evie finds the wedding host handsome and charming. Oliver explains that the Alexanders handle Walter's real estate holdings exclusively, and Walter isn't a relative of Evie. Evie can't wait to attend the wedding of the century, but she doesn't know that she will be center stage for a bloody scheme that's generations in the making.<br/><br/>Imagine if a Hallmark movie morphed into Ready or Not, and that's what you have. The trailers give you 50% of Walter's secrets. If you are a fan of classic horror, this isn't your film. The Invitation is more of a thriller than a horror. The wedding has one shocking factor, but it's all a part of Evie's plan. This film can be a good date movie because it has something for everyone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Narratorlogist Alithea debarks her airplane and pushes her luggage cart through the airport before speaking at a conference. Alithea speaks to the crowd and faints when she sees a pencil-drawn man moving throughout the audience. Instead of taking it easy, Alithea goes to the local market and finds a bottle with a distinct blue swirl and burns. She buys the item and takes it to the hotel room to clean. After a couple of rubs with her toothbrush, a Djinn slinks out of the bottle and offers Alithea three wishes with ground rules. Alithea is only allowed three wishes, and Alithea can't wish for immortality or harm to others. Djinn asks for her heart's desires, and he will make them come true. Instead, she questions Djinn about his origin and other masters. This tale will explain Djinn's 3000 years of longing.<br/><br/>Based on The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye by A.S. Byatt, this director made this film for an audience that loves fantasy and poetry. Alithea narrates the story like a fairy tale because you wouldn't believe her any other way. The graphics compliment her narration seamlessly. If you are into fantastical plots with metrical structures, you should check out this movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Dr. Nate travels to a remote jungle in Africa with his two daughters, Norah and Meridith. Their mother died a year ago, so Nate wants to connect with them by showing them their mother's home. The three meet up with Martin, a childhood friend of their mother, and settle into his home.<br/><br/>On their first outing, Martin takes them to a large rock formation with a lion pride he studies. The girls watch in fear as the lion runs towards Martin, but they relax when the lion hugs him. Martin moves closer and sees a gash on one of the females' front paws. Martin wants to examine it, but she snarls a warning to stay away. Martin explains a poacher must have hurt her, plans to help later, and gets in his car. They drive to their mother's old village to find it empty. Nate goes inside and sees dozens of people slaughtered and mulled. They find a wounded man on the side of the road, and the man warns them the devil is in the jungle. Martin grabs his gun and heads into the brush to look for survivors.<br/><br/>Nate attends to the man, but he dies. Nate grabs the gun, tells his daughters to wait in the car, and goes to find Martin. Nate hears Martin screaming to get in the truck. Nate runs to the vehicle with the Beast behind him. Meridith grabs the wheel to drive away but crashes it. Nate gets a call on his walkie-talkie from Martin. Martin is severely injured but sees the lion staring at him from above. The lion is using Martin as bait. Nate swears to get Martin back and get his girls home safely. But with no car and an angry lion on the prowl, how can they survive the jungle?<br/><br/>First, THIS MOVIE DOES NOT GLORIFY POACHING. Secondly, parents beware. This film depicts disobedient children making dumb decisions and amplifying the problem. You will enjoy this film if you are a fan of Jaws or Cujo. The director increased the intensity with long tracking shots during critical moments, so you become a part of the hunt. Also, this movie discusses anti-poachers and the lion's importance to the local's economy. Yes, the script and fight scenes are farfetched, but they make for a good time in the theater. This movie won't win awards, but it's a much-needed escape with a few jump scares to get your adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
