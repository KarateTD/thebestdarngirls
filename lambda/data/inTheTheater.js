    "review":"Beth calls Loretta Sage multiple times for the final chapter of The Lost City of D..  It's a 20-book franchise featuring the romantic adventures of Dash and Dr. Lovemore.  Beth knows writing became complicated after Loretta's husband, John, died.  Loretta used her love of dead languages and John's archeology exploits to add authenticity to her novels.<br/><br/>Before Loretta's Q and A, Beth tells Loretta to relax, don't be boring, and don't use big words.  Then Beth drops a surprise.  Alan will join Loretta for the Q and A and the upcoming book tour.  Alan portrays Dash on the cover art for Loretta's books, and he dons a wig and takes off his shirt for fans.  Loretta tells Beth that she plans to kill Dash and end the series.  Alan follows Loretta because he wants to know why and how Loretta will kill his character.  When she doesn't give Alan an answer, he snaps and calls her a human mummy.  Alan feels guilty about his insult and goes after Loretta.  When he walks out of the hotel, he sees Loretta trying to get out of a black SUV with three men inside.<br/><br/>Abigail Fairfax is an eccentric billionaire who wants to prove his worth by finding the crown of blood.  He has a section of a scroll with markings, and he wants Loretta to translate it.  He found the actual lost city and bought the island.  He will keep Loretta until she translates the scroll and guides him to the crown.<br/><br/>When Beth and Alan discover Loretta is gone, Alan calls Jack.  Jack is a trainer and CIA agent.  Beth sends Loretta's position to Jack, and he promises to find Loretta.  But Alan doesn't want to wait.  So, Alan joins Jack on Jack's mission to rescue Loretta.  Alan hopes to convince Loretta that he is more than a pretty face.<br/><br/>During their mission, Jack and Alan find Loretta.  Before they pull Loretta away, Loretta steals Abigail's scroll.  When Abigail notices the missing artifact, he sends his henchmen to find Loretta, get the scroll, and kill her friends.  Can they escape the jungle with the crown, or will they fall prey to Abigail's desires?<br/><br/>This film is an action-adventure film with a Hallmark movie in between.  However, it provides lots of underhanded jokes and sly comments.  Loretta and Alan have great on-screen chemistry.  However, Loretta has to learn that she judges Alan quickly and harshly.  And she spills this resentment on to her fans.  This movie is an easy watch, but you need to pay attention to get all the jokes.  And stay for the first set of end credits to get a wanted return.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars",

    "review":"It's Halloween.  And while most of Gotham celebrate candy and debauchery, Bruce Wayne uses his mask for vengeance against the city's underbelly.  Batman has looked over the citizens with Lieutenant Gordon and his signal for two years.  Someone killed mayor Don Mitchell, wrapped his head in tape, cut off his thumb, and wrote 'No More Lies' on him.  The killer, The Riddler, left a card for 'The Batman' with a cipher inside.  The Riddler vows to kill more people and unmask the corruption in Gotham.  Batman uncovers pictures of the mayor with a young woman, that is not his wife, coming out of the Iceberg Lounge.<br/><br/>During questioning, a waitress walks into the room.  She freezes when she sees the photos.  The waitress goes to her apartment that she shares with the young woman, Annika, from the images.  The waitress promises to help Annika getaway.  After changing clothes, the waitress gingerly leaves the apartment through a window.  She goes to the mayor's home, an active crime scene, finds a hidden safe and cracks it.  She pulls out Annika's stolen passport when Batman grabs her.  The waitress is Selina Kyle, Catwoman.  Batman worries about the cat burglar and follows Selina back to her apartment.  Annika and their phones are gone.  Selina tells Batman that she will find answers in the 44 Below Club.  It's a private club within the Iceberg Lounge where the crooked politicians and cops hang out.  Batman knows this will be a target-rich environment for the Riddler, so he devises a plan for him and Selina to work together.  In 7 days, Batman will learn that his mask can inspire hope, create resentment, and reveal dark aspirations.  And all roads lead to Arkham.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best Batman movies since The Dark Knight.  It provides action, mystery, a few jump-scares, and intensely emotional moments.  This movie assumes you know Batman's backstory.  While the story and acting were impressive, the running time made the movie drag.  Don't be surprised if you wonder 'is this the end' several times.  The end credits will tempt you to stay, but there are zero spoilers.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Fifteen years ago, Nate and his brother, Sam, tried to steal Magellan's map.  It was the first map of the world with a secret to where Magellan and his crew hid billions in gold.  A security guard catches them and turns them over to the nuns at the orphanage.  This is Sam's third strike, and he must leave the orphanage to meet with a judge.  Sam goes upstairs to get his things, and Nate follows.  Nate sees Sam about to escape, and Nate begs him not to leave him.  Sam gives Nate a ring, a lighter, a letter, and a promise to return.<br/><br/>Today, Nate is a bartender with a lot of historical knowledge and sticky fingers.  He lifts a bracelet from a customer when a man, Sully, gives him praise.  Nate refuses to work with Sully, and Sully leaves.  Nate checks his pockets, and Sully's business card is in the bracelet's place.  Nate breaks into Sully's home and finds Sully waiting for him.  Sully notices that Nate stopped at the map on the wall before looking for the bracelet.  Then, Sully tells Nate the map is authentic, like the treasure.  To get it, they need two crosses because they're the key.  Sully already has one, but the other will be in an auction.  Nate doesn't want to be a part of the plan, but Sully mentions Sam.  Sully thinks that finding the treasure will lead to Sam.  Nate will quickly learn that there is no honor among thieves.<br/><br/>Based on Uncharted for Playstation, this movie is how game adaptations should be from this point forward.  It was funny, captivating, and suspenseful.  This film was Indiana Jones and National Treasure with a bit of Goonies.  It's no surprise that the mid-credits scene gives sequel hints.  Some action sequences feel like watching a high-resolution video game.  The film never gets slow or bogged down with unnecessary love stories.  Enjoy this adaption on the big screen for maximum viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jackson Briggs works in a gas station's sandwich shop while waiting to hear about his diplomat security application.  Jackson suffered a traumatic brain injury that may result in headaches, blurred vision, and seizures.  Although he got a clean bill of health, Jackson can't connect with Commander Jones on the phone to confirm his work detail.  He gets a call from Jones with unfortunate information that his fellow ranger, Riley, died.  Jackson goes to a local pub to celebrate Riley's life, drink, and talk to someone in charge.  Jones accuses Jackson of buying his medical clearance and drives away.<br/><br/>In the morning, Jones finds Jackson, grabs Jackson by the ankles, and pulls Jackson out of his truck.  Jones tells Jackson to come to Fort Lewis for a mission.  If Jackson completes it, Jones will approve Jackson's application.  Riley's family wants his K-9, LuLu, to attend his funeral.  Jackson remembers LuLu as a badass that loved Grey's Anatomy.  He steps into the cage to pet a muzzled LuLu.  At first, LuLu is calm.  Then, Jackson touches her ears, and she snaps.  This behavior makes LuLu a poor candidate for adoption.  So after the funeral, the military will put LuLu down.  Jackson gets LuLu into the car and starts the 1500 mile journey to Riley's funeral and LuLu's death.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a veteran pushing to get back into duty.  LuLu is a mirror for Jackson's inner turmoil.  She has extreme anxiety, which causes her to pant heavily.  As Jackson accepts LuLu's trials and tribulations, he forgives his own.  The director wonderfully shot moments between Jackson and LuLu to convey all possible emotions.  Enjoy this movie about a veteran and a handler.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hercule Poirot sits at a jazz club and watches a love story develop.  Jacqueline introduces her fiancé, Simon, to her friend, Linnet.  To celebrate, Jacqueline asks Simon to dance with Linnet.  Later, Hercule tries to enjoy dessert in front of a sphinx.  Then he sees a man flying a kite from the middle of the pyramid.  Hercule runs to the man to admonish him but stops when Hercule sees it's Bouc.  Bouc takes Hercule to meet his mother, Euphemia, and they invite Hercule to a wedding party.<br/><br/>At the party, Hercule sees Simon with his new bride, Linnet.  Stunning Linnet wears a 2 million dollar Tiffany necklace and a smile for her guests.  But a hush falls over the crowd when Jacqueline walks into the room.  During each leg of their trip, she appears unwanted to spoil their fun.  At the market, Hercule spots Jacqueline and attempts to plead to her better nature.  Jacqueline tells Hercule that she will never give up, and she has the perfect thing to fix a broken heart: a 22.  Hercule tells Simon and Linnet that they should end their trip, go home, and stay on the property until Jacqueline calms down.  But Simon refuses to let Jacqueline ruin their vacation, and he decides to gain distance by renting a ship, The Karnak, to travel the Nile.  And they invite Hercule to come aboard.<br/><br/>They travel to the rock temples at Abu Simbel, and Simon grabs Linnet for some alone time.  Then a rock comes close to killing the couple, but Hercule doesn't think it is an accident caused by the sand storm.  They board the boat in fear and find a shock.  Jacqueline awaits their return.  After night falls, Linnet takes a pill and resigns to her room.  Simon grows tired of Jacqueline's actions and makes his feelings known.  Jacqueline grabs her gun and shoots Simon in the leg.  Others pull them apart and Linnet's school friend, Rosalie, kicks the gun under the couch.

At first, everyone blames Jacqueline, but Mrs. Bowers says she never left Jacqueline's side.  Hercule swears to find the killer before they hit land.<br/><br/>Based on Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie, this movie doesn't pick up exactly where the first one left off, but it does bring the films together.  You must watch from the beginning because the writer explains Hercule's famous mustache and wartorn start.  Within 30 minutes, the plot introduces all the characters and their connection to Linnet.  This chapter in the Hercule series is better than the first and will make you want more.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
