    "mtitle": "Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot",
    "review": "First Lady Donna Martin is happy with her family in the small town of Possum Trot. Her husband, Reverand W.C. Martin, leads the Bennett Baptist Church. They have two children, Ladonna and Princeton. However, Donna's mother, Murtha, wants Donna and W.C. to have more children. Murtha, the mother of 18, returns home and dies. Donna falls into a depression for months. After arguing with W.C., Donna leaves the house and travels to the ruins of her childhood home. There, she sees a group of children playing and hears God speak to her. Donna calls her sister, Diann, and asks Diann to attend an adoption seminar.<br/><br/>Social worker Susan explains that 70% of the children suffer from poverty-induced neglect. The other 30% suffered severe abuse. She shows Diann and Donna images of the other 30%, and the pictures call both to act.<br/><br/>A brother and sister come to Susan's office with heartbreaking stories. Susan exhausts all her options. Donna jumps at the chance to help and welcomes them into her home. W.C. preaches to their congregation about their adoption, the excuses not to adopt, and the bible's most notable adoption. It inspires 22 families to adopt. However, the people can't afford to come to Susan for the classes. They ask Susan to host it in their church. This small town will make a lasting imprint on the children, Texas, and the system, but it won't be easy.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't make adoption look effortless. However, the families in Possum Trot never give up. The writers don't depict adoption as a magic bullet to fix these children's long-term hardships. It's the first step of many. When W.C. and Donna see the town falling apart and second-guessing their choice, they lean on each other with group prayer and outreach. They recap the children and townspeople today at the conclusion before asking the audience to help. It will assist viewers make an informed choice about adoption. But hopefully, it will spark a passion for others to follow Possum Trot's lead.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Despicable Me 4",
    "review": "Gru and 3 of his minions attend Gru's high school reunion at Lyc√©e Pas Bon, School of Villainy. Gru isn't there to meet old friends. He is working undercover for the Anti-Villain League to catch Maxime Le Mal. Maxime reminds his former classmates about his affinity for cockroaches. He admires them so much he turns himself into a hybrid: half man, half roach. Gru gives the secret phrase, and the AVL runs in, fights, and captures Maxime.<br/><br/>Gru spends time with his wife, Lucy, and daughters - Margot, Agnes, and Edith. However, the newest addition, Gru Jr., maintains an icy demeanor around his father. The family plans for the day when they get a visit from Silas Ramsbottom. Silas warns Gru that Maxime vowed vengeance against Gru before escaping prison. The AVL wants Gru and his family to move to a safe house in Mayflower until they catch Maxime.<br/><br/>Gru and Lucy want to help the girls settle into their new lives, but Margot and Agnes face difficulties. Gru tries to start a conversation between the neighbor's daughter, Poppy, and Margot, but Poppy ignores them. Later, Poppy tells Gru she knows his real identity and will expose him if Gru doesn't help her. Gru must help Poppy to keep his away from Maxime's clutches. Can he do it?<br/><br/>The fourth film in the Despicable Me franchise leans on slapstick humor to entertain the audience. Gru Jr. is the only character with growth in this installment. This movie is about Gru saving Gru Jr. and gaining Gru Jr.'s trust. Viewers will laugh because Gru Jr. is as devious as his father and delights in irritating him. Gru doesn't think his son loves him, but Gru Jr. is his father's son. The final song offers easter eggs for Minions and prequel fans. Also, the film doesn't have post- or mid-credit scenes. This movie won't be your favorite, but your kids will laugh.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Inside Out 2",
    "review": "Over the years, Riley became an excellent student, strong hockey player, animal lover, and caring friend. Her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - continue to share her core memories and store them in long-term storage. The vital memories form her beliefs. Each belief creates Riley's belief system and her sense of self, the newest section of her mind. Joy will do anything to protect the latest system.<br/><br/>Riley celebrates with her best friends Grace and Bree as the coach of the Fire Hawks, Coach Roberts, approaches them after winning a game. She wants them to come to her hockey camp to train. Her favorite player, Val, is on the team. Val started her first year and is a legend among high school players. Grace, Bree, and Riley accept the invitation.<br/><br/>Riley goes to bed the night before camp and dreams of meeting Val and practicing with her friends. As Riley turns in for the night, her emotions do the same. A beeping awakes Joy in the middle of the night. She and the other emotions walk over to the console and see the puberty light gently flashing. Then, it blares. The demo team rips out the console and updates it for the new guys, but Riley wakes up before they finish.<br/><br/>Riley's mother, Mrs. Andersen, enters Riley's room and expresses her surprise that Riley isn't ready for camp. Her emotions touch the console, and Riley cries, yells, and collapses in bed. They find a new emotion touching it. Anxiety introduces Riley's emotions to Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment.<br/><br/>The Andersens give Riley and her friends a ride to camp. Riley talks about their future together when Disgust notices a look on Bree's face. Grace feels the tension and blurts out that she and Bree will attend a different high school. Riley maintains her composure until her parents drive away. Val notices Riley's sadness, talks to her, and invites Riley to sit with her team. Anxiety takes over and defuses the situation by predicting possible outcomes and changes Riley's personality to give Riley the best conclusion. Joy tries to help, but her attempts make Riley look silly. Anxiety tells Embarrassment to grab Riley's old emotions after Joy makes another mistake. Anxiety tells the mind police to take them to Riley's Dark Secrets Vault. Then, Anxiety disconnects Riley's Sense of Self and sends it to the back of Riley's mind. They will use her new memories with second-generation emotions to build a new Riley. Can Riley's first-generation emotions return to Riley's mind before Anxiety takes over?<br/><br/>Riley and her emotions did it again. They cause the audience to laugh, cringe, cry, and breathe a sigh of relief. The writers added new sections of Riley's mind while taking fans through familiar territory. Riley breaks the rules, disregards her friends, and forces herself to practice when her other emotions are at the helm. Riley loses her Sense of Self for popularity. The movie explains how Anxiety works, helps, and harms people in a lovingly gentle way. The conclusion profoundly affects adults and teaches kids the value of emotions. You should see this movie in theaters today.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Bad Boys: Ride or Die",
    "review": "Marcus delivers a toast at a moment he thought would never happen: Mike's wedding. Marcus cries as he wishes Mike the best with his new bride, Christine. Marcus gets help from Captain Conrad's daughter, U.S. Marshall Judy, and granddaughter, Callie. Marcus dances the Wobble and suffers a heart attack. Captain Conrad assures Marcus that he won't die and gives Marcus a warning. Marcus wakes up with a new lease on life and is 100% fearless. As Marcus begs Mike to get him Skittles, Mike gets a news alert on his phone. The FBI found evidence that Captain Conrad was working with the drug cartels.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus run to headquarters to clear their captain's legacy, but Captain Rita and her boyfriend, Attorney General Lockwood, must follow the evidence. Judy enters and demands they find the real culprits. Mike offers to help, but she refuses because Mike's son, Armando, killed her dad.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus ride and contemplate their next steps when they get a video message from Conrad. He was looking into corruption after their ecstasy bust years ago. Now, he needs his Bad Boys to clear his name. He warns them to trust no one. Mike believes they must ask a cartel member to catch the corruption.<br/><br/>Mike and Marcus visit Armando in prison. Armando states that Conrad was clean. Also, his mother, Isabel, didn't put Conrad on the list; someone added him. Mike and Marcus find Conrad's secret case files and pull Armando out of jail to go through them. They believe they have an advantage, but the culprit is one step ahead. To get through this, Mike and Marcus will need fate, AMMO, Reggie, and alligators.<br/><br/>For newcomers to the franchise, it helps to see the three previous films before watching this 4th installment. This chapter of the buddy-action-comedy will introduce a new version of Bad Boys, tie up loose ends, and show you another side of Reggie. Unlike the previous films, Mike is cautious and has panic attacks. However, Marcus is fearless and wild. Their switch, along with the action-packed fight scenes, make this movie entertaining. Be prepared to laugh, wince, and cheer.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Summer Camp",
    "review": "Nora arrived at Camp Pinnacle because her parents wanted her to make friends. Nora hears Jane begging Mary to get out of the bathroom. Ginny barges into the bathroom and discovers Mary started her period. Ginny talks Mary through it and pulls Mary out. Later, Ginny sees Nora struggling at archery and assists. The counselors put Nora, Mary, and Ginny in a cabin together. The three remained friends.<br/><br/>It's their Camp reunion, and Ginny, a bestselling author, is excited to attend but worries her friends won't make it. Mary wanted to become a doctor. But she left school to become a wife and mother. She became an E.R. nurse later, but Ginny thinks Mary settled for her husband. Nora excelled in school and obtained multiple degrees. She dove deeper into work after her husband died. Ginny believes this reunion is what their friendship needs. It's so much more.<br/><br/>Each of these women stands their ground and finds their voice. Nora delves into work because it's safe but never ventures out for more. Nora learns her wants in marriage and friendship. Ginny assumes she has all the answers, but only because she doesn't let anyone else speak. After they grow and admit their faults, they ask one question: Am I The A. Hole. While the movie had the fun and raunchiness of camp, the bloopers were funnier than the film. The start and conclusion were entertaining, but the middle dragged. If this plot isn't for you, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
