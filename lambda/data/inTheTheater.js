    "mtitle": "Disney's Snow White",
    "review": "The King and Queen wait patiently for their baby. Then, they gave birth during a blizzard and named their child Snow White. Everything was lovely until the Queen fell ill and died. The King lived in grief until a woman from a faraway land came to the kingdom. Her beauty could create magic, and the King was entranced. He married her. Then, the new Queen warned the King that another village would attack. He gathered his men to fight and never returned. The Queen took the throne and let her true colors shine. Every day, the Evil Queen asked her magic mirror one question: 'Who is the fairest of them all?' The Evil Queen gleamed when it responded that she was the fairest.<br/><br/>Years went by, and the people forgot about Snow White. The Evil Queen thrived while the people withered. One day, Snow White caught Jonathan stealing bread. The Evil Queen tells them to lock him in the dungeon, but Snow White interjects because the punishment isn't fair. The Evil Queen tells the huntsmen to steal Jonathan's coat and shoes. And then tie him to the palace gates. The people will watch him succumb to the elements and learn not to take from the Evil Queen.<br/><br/>Snow White sneaks to the gates, unties Jonathan, and gives him a scrap of bread. In the castle, the Evil Queen questions her magic mirror again. This time, the magic mirror answers that Snow White is the fairest. The Evil Queen can't contain her rage. She summons a huntsman. The Evil Queen tells the huntsman to take Snow White apple picking in the woods. When Snow White is deep in the forest, he should kill her, put her heart in a box, and bring the box to the Evil Queen.<br/><br/>The huntsman takes Snow White into the woods and pulls out a blade. When he lunges at her, she asks him 'why.' He freezes and can't kill her. Snow White stumbles into the woods. And with the woodland creatures' help, she finds a haven but doesn't know it belongs to seven small miners. At the castle, the Evil Queen prompts the magic mirror again. It says Snow White is the fairest. She calls all the huntsman and demands that they find Snow White and bring her immediately. Will Snow White prevail as the fairest and free her people, or will the Evil Queen kill her?<br/><br/>This live adaptation has the foundation of the original but makes a few changes. Snow White is a fair maiden who needs help. While the dwarves and Jonathan rescue her, she saves the kingdom. The film has a few of your favorite songs while adding new tunes. The animators did a superb job bringing the woods to life as Snow White flees. This picture's mistake is in the running time. They added new elements to create a fresh story but bored the audience. Also, the editors attempted to drown out poor singing with loud background music, but it didn't help. This film is better suited for Disney lovers, not obsessers, with money for the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Black Bag",
    "review": "British Intelligence Officer George meets with his boss, Meacham, in an alleyway. Meacham informs George that a nuclear program called Severus leaked. He gives George a list of five people with the knowledge, skill, and clearance level to obtain Severus. George's wife, Kathryn, is on the list. George vows to find the mole in a week.<br/><br/>George returns home and plans a dinner with the suspects. However, he warns Kathryn to avoid one item because it contains drugs. Agents James, Zoe, Freddie, and Clarissa arrive. James and Freddie are field agents. James is in a relationship with agency psychiatrist Dr. Zoe, and Freddie is dating satellite analyst Clarissa. As the drugs take effect, everyone becomes unencumbered and reveals secrets. After everyone leaves, George finds a movie ticket stub for Dark Window in the trash.<br/><br/>George and Kathryn prepare for work. He asks her to go to the movies with him to see Dark Window. She states that she hasn't heard of it. She will be on a mission tomorrow. George inquires about it, but she says, 'Black Bag.' They use the term to hide classified information about their job without lying. However, George wonders if Kathryn lied about the movie. He will investigate his colleagues and the love of his life. Can George uncover the rat and find Severus while keeping his marriage?<br/><br/>This movie is exciting in its simplicity. You don't get constant action like in Mission Impossible but an intriguing mystery with spies like Hercule Poirot. The opening scene has a hypnotizing tracking shot that follows George as he searches for Meacham. Every scene, conversation, and object has a purpose to the enigma. Unlike other thrillers, the script had two impactful meetings that involved all the suspects. The first is a dinner that allows George to probe for information. The second is the unveiling. This meeting is brisk but reveals a lot of information in five minutes. So keep your ears open. This movie will cause many spirited discussions and a few laughs while entertaining. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mickey 17",
    "review": "Mickey Barnes started a macaroon shop with his friend Timo. Mickey discovered that Timo had borrowed money from a local loan shark when the shop folded. The loan shark threatened to kill them if they didn't pay back his money. So, Mickey and Timo joined a group of passengers on the flight to Niflheim. The flight will leave Earth to start a new colony under the guidance of the failed politician, Kenneth Marshall, and Kenneth's adoring wife, Ylfa. Without any special skills, Mickey signs on as an Expendable.<br/><br/>Expendables are reprinted people. Niflheim scientist scan their bodies and store their memories. The technology is illegal on Earth. However, scientists can use expendables to test the atmosphere, medicine, and food on the ship and the new planet. If the person dies, the scientists will reprint them. While the technology is legal off Earth, one law remains true everywhere: no multiples. They will destroy any multiples along with their memories.<br/><br/>Mickey arrives on the ship and notices everyone fawning over Kenneth and Ylfa except Nasha. Nasha is a security officer, and they fall in love. Mickey 17 goes on an expedition into Niflheim's caverns with other explorers. They find unknown creatures and panic, causing a cave-in. Kenneth names the unknown inhabitants Creepers. Mickey falls through the ice, and Timo finds him. However, Timo leaves Mickey 17 to die because they will reprint Mickey. Mickey waits for the Creepers to eat them and pray they take big bites. However, the Creepers don't eat him and kick Mickey 17 out of the lair. Mickey 17 hitches a ride back to Niflheim and lies in his bed. He jumps when he sees Mickey 18. Mickey 17 doesn't want to kill Mickey 18, but Mickey 17 knows Kenneth will end them permanently when he discovers they are multiples. Can Mickey 17 survive before someone finds them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Mickey7 by Edward Ashton, this movie is 45 minutes too long because it changes course at the 1-hour mark. This film switches from a comedy about a man with horrific luck to a story about overthrowing a dictatorship. Then, the message changes from dictatorship to colonization. This film feels like a bait-and-switch. The saving grace is the plot's humor and the graphics. The writer finds ease in laughing at the macabre. The Mickey's onscreen interaction is seamless and doesn't distract. The cinematography is worth regular pricing, but the script is for the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Waitress Mildred Burke is a single mother who works in her mother's diner. However, Mildred never wants to be ordinary. She dreams of being a wrestler, but every state bans women in the squared circle. Mildred and her mother, Bertha, attend a wrestling match and watch Billy Wolfe win.<br/><br/>Billy and his son, G. Bill, patronize Bertha's diner. Mildred approaches Billy and gushes over him. She asks Billy to train her, and he says no. Months later, Billy and G. Bill enter the restaurant again. Bertha encourages Mildred to approach Billy again but tells Mildred not to back down. Mildred spews fire towards Billy, and he loves her moxie. He offers to train her the next day.<br/><br/>Mildred arrives at the carnival, and Billy and G. Bill sit outside the ring. To prove her worth, Billy has Mildred face a man. She wins and impresses Billy. Billy and Mildred work the carnival circuit but can't get legitimate work until the states lift the ban. Over time, Mildred becomes a household name and creates a business with Billy. Mildred chooses to marry Billy to solidify their professional relationship. That decision will impact Mildred's life and professional wrestling, but force her legacy in darkness for years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Queen of the Ring: Sex, Muscles, Diamonds, and the Making of an American Legend by Jeff Leen, this movie is the hidden history in professional wrestling. Mildred was the first million-dollar female athlete and accomplished it while being a single mother. She refused to let the era dictate her path. Instead, she played within it. The film credits Billy with elevating women's wrestling and integrating the sport. However, the film didn't skip past his abusive nature in and out of the ring. The audience doesn't need to be a wrestling fan to appreciate the picture. The costumes, hair, makeup, and wrestling style perfectly encapsulate the period. This film is an astounding tribute to the sport and Mildred's legacy. It's for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Witch Gray Alys uses her powers to escape death by hanging. The church enforcer, Ash, demands her soldiers find Gray Alys because she could start a revolution. Gray Alys retreats to her home and waits for customers. The Queen and her counsel, Jerais, arrive at Gray Alys's home. She wants Gray Alys to help her become a shapeshifter. Gray Alys must find a werewolf in his lair during the full moon. Then, skin it and bring the pelt to the Queen to wear. Jerais stays behind after the Queen leaves. He pays Gray Alys with a timepiece and tells her to fail the Queen. Gray Alys can't refuse.<br/><br/>Gray Alys uses her powers to enter the werewolf's mind and discovers it's living in Skull River. The people only talk of one man surviving the trek, Boyce the Hunter. She offers Boyce Jerais's timepiece if he takes her to Skull River. The catch is she must get there in 5 days.

They start their journey to Skull River.<br/><br/>At the church, Patriarch Johan heard a rumor that the Queen sought help from the witch. He believes that anyone who works with a witch should die. The Queen's husband, the Overlord, is ill and has no heirs. He demands Ash find Gray Alys and bring her to the church for questioning. Then, he will kill Gray Alys and the Queen and rule the land. Will Ash find Gray Alys before Gray Alys and Boyce reach Skull River?<br/><br/>Based on a short story by George R. R. Martin, this epic fantasy film contains magic and mystery but promises that it's not a fairy tale. The plot has a Shakespearean level of drama while providing several twists. The visual effects team provides a gray and red color scheme to accentuate the apocalyptic backdrop to the story. It's visually stunning and action-filled with a splash of romance. This film is a love letter to fans of this genre. It is an instant cult classic that will go over the heads of outsiders.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
