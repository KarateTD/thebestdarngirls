The empty town discourages Toula, but Ian and her family give her faith to keep going. Toula vows to find Gus's friends and deliver the journal before returning to the States.<br/><br/>In case you were wondering, Yes. This movie has a Greek wedding in Greece. Like most adults, Toula enters the next phase of her marriage to Ian. They must care for their parents and pass the traditions to the younger generation. But Toula must balance between Gus's wishes and Ian's vacation. Ian must refocus her energy to have fun and not worry about Paris, the family, or the secrets. Yes, there are explosive secrets for the Portokaloses and the Millers. The family packs joy with their open, loving, and caring nature. They love each other no matter if they are shaving at the dinner table, swimming nude, or drinking. This film doesn't try to one-up the previous movies. It gels with them perfectly. For fans of the Greeks, see this movie in theaters.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"PJ wants this year to be different. So, she will approach her crush, Brittany, and ask her out. PJ suggests that her best friend, Josie, do the same with her love interest, Isabel. PJ convinces Josie to attend the school fair. Hazel runs into Josie and PJ at the fair and inquires about Josie's arm in a sling. PJ jokingly lies about being in juvie with Josie. They ignore Hazel when they see Isabel and Brittany. Josie stumbles over her words and invites Josie to interject. Josie can't put a coherent sentence together and runs away. PJ spots Isabel and Jeff fighting while Isabel walks away from Jeff. They offer Isabel a safe ride home, and Isabel gets in the car. Jeff jumps in front of the vehicle to stop them. When he doesn't move, Josie barely taps Jeff with her bumper. He falls to the ground, screaming in pain.<br/><br/>Jeff comes to school on crutches the next day, and the entire school believes Josie hit Jeff. They are the talk of the classroom. Principal Meyers calls them into his office to expel them. Josie falsely states that they are part of a self-defense club for female empowerment. Josie ponders the idea and thinks it's the best way to meet cute girls in the school, especially Brittany and Isabel.<br/><br/>The number of attendees for their first meeting underwhelmed Josie and PJ. But they keep up the lie and train. After the first punch, Hazel tells them they need an advisor. Josie and PJ elect their history teacher, Mr. G. because they assume he won't come. He makes it to the second meeting, along with Isabel and Brittany. A football player, Tim, worries the club is taking the cheerleaders' attention away from the football team. So, he tells Josie and PJ to shut it down before he exposes their lies and motives. Josie and PJ choose to ignore Tim. And their choice will have bloody, explosive, and deadly consequences.<br/><br/>This dark satire is a mix of Booksmart and Not Another Teen Movie but not as funny or raunchy. Viewers will spend more time being shocked than laughing out loud. The script exposes misguided views of feminism, the misunderstood differences of sexuality, and the vast subsets of feminity. It starts as a raunchy statement piece but becomes increasingly weird and disjointed. The final fight scene feels like a desperate attempt to save the film and create a believable ending for the leads. While critics raved, it's best to view this film at home.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A mobster, Lorenzo, drives into his property to find dead bodies everywhere. He tells his young son to stay in the car. A nervous man with a gun tells Lorenzo the culprit is waiting in the cellar. He is Robert McCall. Robert gives Lorenzo seconds to decide his fate. Lorenzo takes too long, and Robert kills him and Lorenzo's remaining goons. Robert walks outside, sees Lorenzo's son in the truck, and tells the boy to stay put. When Robert turns his back, the boy shoots Robert, but Robert survives.<br/><br/>A local <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte carabinieri, Bonucci</lang>, finds Robert unconscious in his car with a large gunshot wound and takes Robert to a doctor, Enzo. When Robert wakes up, Enzo asks Robert if he is a good man or a bad one. Robert answers that he doesn't know and passes out. Three days later, Robert wakes up and insists on walking around. Enzo warns him to take it slow.<br/><br/>Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA agent Emma Collins. Robert alerts Emma to Lorenzo's operation and hangs up. As Robert heals, he captivates the <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte</lang> citizens, finds peace in the small community, and puts his watch away. However, Camorra members disrupt Robert's ease when Robert sees them taking protection money from the businesses. Robert tries not to intervene, but they go one step too far. And Robert puts on his watch of fate. He will rid <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte</lang> of the Camorra while Emma follows Robert's lead to the notorious crime syndicate.<br/><br/>The third and final movie of the Equalizer franchise doesn't disappoint. It starts with the bloody aftermath of Robert's rampage and then jumps into the action. The movie balances humor, heart, and bloodlust with precision and ease. The movie gives you a brief flashback into the first film while giving a quip to the second. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and brutal. In between Robert's fighting and mingling, Emma uncovers a mystery with Robert's guidance. This fast-paced movie requires your attention, but you don't need to see the first 2 to watch this gem.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Matt talks to his boss, Anders, because their client lost 3 million euros and 24 hours. Now, the client wants to pull their money out, and Anders wants Matt to persuade the client to stay. Matt agrees while walking out of his gym. Matt's wife, Heather, reminds Matt that he promised to take the children to school this morning because she needed to see her friend. Matt calls his daughter, Emily, and son, Zach, downstairs. Matt begs Zach to get in the car. Zach yields.<br/><br/>Matt hears a phone ringing and assumes it's Emily's or Zach's. It's not their ringtone. Matt looks inside the armrest and finds a mobile phone displaying an unknown number. Matt picks up the phone, and the person on the other end tells him to follow instructions. Or he will blow up the car. The voice on the phone warns Matt not to get out of the car. The seats have a pressure plate. If Matt and his children want to get out alive, Matt has to do what the voice says. Matt will spark a police chase, panic, and a conspiracy.<br/><br/>This movie will make you hold your breath as Matt runs into dangerous and sad obstacles. The core of this film asks: How well do you know someone? Like any high-octane film, the police are clueless and barely look beyond the surface. If you watch these action-packed nail-biters, you can pick out the culprit after seeing this person in one critical scene. This latest action flick is thrilling, but once is good enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"<lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime Reyes</lang> returns home to his family after finishing his pre-law degree. His family anxiously awaits his arrival, but his sister, Milagro, wants the family to be honest with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang>. Their father, Alberto, and mother, Rocio, tell Milagro to wait until <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> eats to give him the unfortunate news.<br/><br/>After <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes his first bite, Milagro tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> that his parents must sell their home. And Alberto had a heart attack. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> uncle Rudy blames Kord Industries for the gentrification. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> promises to find a job and move the family to a big house on the hills.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro got a job cleaning pools to make ends meet. As they scrape gum off the pool furniture, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> spots Veronica Kord and her private security, Ignacio, walking inside the home. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> can't work up the nerve to ask Veronica for a job, but Milagro has no problems using Veronica's bathroom.<br/><br/>Jennifer pulls her aunt, Veronica, into a room and watches an ad for the One Man Army Corp, a.k.a. OMAC. Jennifer reminds Veronica that Jennifer's father, Ted, didn't want Kord Industries involved in weapons manufacturing anymore. Veronica demands that Jennifer back off. Jennifer walks towards the door to exit, and Ignacio tries to grab her, but <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> verbally defends Jennifer. Veronica fires <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro. Jennifer tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> to come to Kord Industries, and she will find a job for him.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> arrives with his cheering family in tow. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> sees Jennifer running down an escalator and onto an elevator. He mirrors her movements and meets her downstairs. She hands <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> a burger container. She demands that he guard it with his life and never open it.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes it home, and his family encourages him to open the box. They all play with the high-tech scarab inside. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> touches it, it scans his face, goes inside his body, and attaches to his spine. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> wakes up, he is on his parents' couch naked. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> steals Rudy's car to get answers from Jennifer. After dodging a hail of bullets, Jennifer sits with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> family to explain. The scarab is a world-destroying weapon that chooses its hosts.

The graphics are stellar for a DC film. This color palette of the film reflects <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and his family. It's fun, bright, and burst with excitement. The downside of this movie is the sound effects drown out <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> suit's A.I., Khaji-Da. See this film on the best screen possible, and don't let the detractors keep you away. Also, there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
