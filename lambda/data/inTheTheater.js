    "mtitle":"Gladiator II",
    "review":"Twin Emperors Geta and Caracalla rule Rome 16 years after Marcus Aurelius's death. The twins ignored Marcus's vision of a Roman government ruled by the people. They want to expand their dominance to other countries with the help of their general, Acacius. Acacius and his soldiers are victorious, capture the defeated soldiers, and make them slaves to Rome, including a refugee named Hanno. Acacius takes the slaves to Ostia. There, Macrinus will determine which slaves will make the best gladiators.<br/><br/>Acacius sees the emperors' corrupt ways and becomes disillusioned with Roman rule. He shares his thoughts with his wife, Lucilla. She shares her father's vision and agrees with Acacius. They must find people who agree and secretly overthrow the emperors.<br/><br/>Macrinus studies the slaves, and Hanno captures his eye. Hanno recites a passage from a Roman poet. Macrinus can see that Hanno has an education. Macrinus despises the emperors' rule and wants to overthrow them too. But he wants Hanno to be his instrument of destruction. Hanno agrees, but only if Macrinus allows him to kill Acacius. Macrinus doesn't know Hanno's secret history to the Roman Empire and true Gladiator.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't focus on the battles like its predecessor. It uses the drama to drive the story forward. This sequel feels more like Shakespeare than an action film. The costumes, dialog, and set design teleport you into 180 AD. However, the audience doesn't rally behind or have concern for Hanno. You will find Macrinus more intriguing than the Gladiator. This picture is bloody and theatrical, but it's missing a spark.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Moana 2",
    "review": "Moana has taken to her Wayfinder roots. She travels to other islands to find people. Moana climbs the tallest mountain, blows her horn, and waits for a response. However, she hears nothing. Moana's parents, Tui and Sina, wait patiently for Moana while her little sister, Simea, runs to her. The village celebrates her return and asks for updates.<br/><br/>Moana takes Simea to the caverns and tells Simea the story about their ancestors - the Wayfinders. Tautai Vasa took his crew to Motufetu Island. But the god Nalo caused a storm that destroyed their canoe. Tui pulls Moana aside. She is the first Wayfinder in generations, and he wants her to accept the title Tautai. Moana humbly takes the title in a ritual. Today, the ancestors want Moana to find Motufetu because it connects people worldwide. Moana wakes and tells her tribe.<br/><br/>Moana prepares to leave, but Sina thinks Moana needs a crew, and Heihei isn't enough. Moana chooses Loto, Kela, and Moni. Moana approaches Moni's tapestry of Maui and whispers for Maui to join her. However, Maui doesn't respond. Moana, Loto, Kela, Moni, Heihei, and Pua travel to find the lost island of Motufetu.<br/><br/>Goddess Matangi holds Maui captive in a secret location. Her boss, God Nalo, is furious with Maui. Maui helped Moana. Nalo knows humans can reunite the people and end his control over the land. A united world would dismantle Nalo's power. Maui tells Matangi that Moana isn't Nalo's problem. Matangi tells Maui that it's too late. Nalo will end Moana. Maui and his tattoo must free themselves and warn Moana to stay away from Motufeto before Matangi and Nalo end the lives of her and her crew.<br/><br/>This sequel expands the island and world of Moana. Moana has friends who help her prepare for her missions. She is a proud chief and Wayfinder. It's best to watch the first movie before seeing the second. The script mentions what happened in the past but doesn't go into great detail. The graphics express the growth of the Disney animation team. The entire theater will light up with their artwork. Children will love the movie. It takes them on a new adventure, focusing on problem-solving, teamwork, and fun. This film has one mid-credit scene, but it's unnecessary to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Elevation",
    "review": "Three years ago, creatures crawled out of a sinkhole and killed 95% of the human population in a month. The surviving humans call them Reapers and can't kill them. Humans discovered that the Reapers wouldn't go above 8,000 feet. So, they migrated there and created settlements.<br/><br/>Today, Will raises his son, Hunter, on the Rocky Mountains Settlement in Colorado. He lost his wife, Tara, to a Reaper and now raises Hunter alone. During the night, Hunter's alarm rang because his breathing apparatus needed a new filter. Will replaced it but doesn't have another. Without the filter, Hunter will die. Will believes the Boulder Hospital will have boxes of them and creates a plan to descend to retrieve them, but he needs help.<br/><br/>Will walks to Nina's cabin and tells her his plan. She laughs because no one survives a Reaper attack. Will points out that Nina lived. Nina is a physicist from Caltech. She hypothesized a way to kill the Reapers but needed a chemical from her lab. Nina, Tara, and several other people descended to get the items. Nina was the only person who returned. Although Will blames Nina, he needs her to get through them. Nina comes with her Reaper locator. Tara's best friend, Katie, stops them as Will and Nina get extra bullets. She refuses to let Will go without her. They will use the Calway Mines to the Boulder Hospital. He can get the filters for Hunter and save Hunter's life. Can they make it without awakening the Reapers?<br/><br/>This post-apocalyptic thriller ends with a cliffhanger. Will, Nina, and Katie are on different missions but on the same path. Will wants to save his son, Nina desires to help the world, and Katie wants to assist Will. They understand it's a suicide mission but continue on the journey. The plot's antagonist is the Reapers. However, the mid-credit scene points to a larger plan or a part two. The ill-created visual effects are distracting and make the film less scary. This film has the makings of a cult classic, but part two will likely be on a streaming platform.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Here",
    "review": "A realtor walks a newlywed couple, Al and Rose Young, around a house and shows them the large dining room, living room, and kitchen. She states the price is $3400, and Al gags. He only expected to pay $3000. However, the realtor states Al's G.I. bill will help them. Before Al ponders further, Rose says she's pregnant. Al chooses to buy the home.<br/><br/>Rose gives birth to Richard and has two more children, Jimmy and Elizabeth. Years later, Richard brings his girlfriend, Margaret, home to meet his parents. Rose pats Margaret's hand, stands up, and tells her to focus on her dreams because time won't wait. Richard asks Margaret to spend the night here. She wants to spend the rest of her life here. 'Here' has been many things to many people.<br/><br/>Based on Here by Richard McGuire, this movie's plot centers on the Young family. However, the timeline stretches from prehistoric days until now. The scenes overlay like photos in a scrapbook during pivotal moments to make the connection. The camera doesn't change angles until the last 10 seconds. This spot has a place in history and with each family. It goes through birth, life, and death. This director and editor stayed faithful to the source material and made the movie identical to the graphic novel. This picture isn't for you if you don't like a nonlinear story. This movie will be in film classes for years to come.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "We Live in Time",
    "review": "Tobias finishes a promo video for his employer, Weetabix. He returns to his room and opens his divorce papers. He finds a pencil, but the tip breaks off. Desperate to sign the document, Tobias leaves the room in his bathrobe and walks to a convenience store. He buys several pens and a chocolate orange. Tobias strolls to his hotel and bends down to pick up a dropped orange slice. He wakes up in a hospital with Almut sitting across from him. Almut admits she hit Tobias with her car.<br/><br/>Almut and a heavily bandaged Tobias eat at a 1950s American-styled diner. She is a Bavarian fusion chef and upcoming restauranteur. Her place will open in a few days, and she invites Tobias to come with his wife, pointing at his wedding ring.<br/><br/>Tobias arrives at the restaurant, and Almut has him reserved at a table for two. He only needs a table for 1. Tobias sits, eats, and experiences bliss. Almut comes over to hear his opinion and notices he's alone. They go to Almut's apartment and spend the night together. It's the first night of the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>This story is in a nonlinear narrative. It starts with Almut going on a run, gathering eggs from their chickens, and cooking breakfast for Tobias. Then, they are holding hands in a doctor's office and discussing treatment. Next, the story recalls the first day Tobias and Almut met. The audience sees who they became after they struggled as a couple. The storytelling is compelling even when the plot slows. This movie is more than a rom-com. It's a celebration of love through perseverance.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars",
