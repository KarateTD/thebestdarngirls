    "review":"Ellie Turner dances in her bedroom and listens to 60s music when she sees her mother's reflection in her mirror. Then Ellie's grandmother, Peggy, calls Ellie downstairs.  Ellie got an acceptance letter from the London College of Fashion. Peggy begs Ellie to take care of herself because she has the same 'gift' for seeing ghosts as her mother. Ellie rents a room from Ms. Collins and gets comfortable.  On her first night in the house, Ellie dreams she is in 1960s London.  And when Ellie looks at her reflection, Ellie sees a young blonde girl.  The girl's name is Sandie, and she went to the Cafe de Paris to find the owner.  Sandie wants to become a singer and take over the London night scene.  The bartender tells Sandie the owner isn't there but a manager, Jack, is looking for new talent. Soon they are on the dance floor, kissing and running away after Jack defends Sandie's honor.<br/><br/>Then Ellie wakes up and goes to class.  Jocasta spots a hickey on Ellie's neck, and Ellie remembers it's from Jack kissing Sandie.  Soon, Ellie dyes her hair, dresses, and talks like Sandie.  The next night, Ellie watches as Jack gets Sandie an audition at a club, and Sandie wows the owner. When she is fast asleep, Ellie is in the audience.  She expects to see Sandie front and center, singing for the world to see.  But Sandie is another chorus girl in the burlesque show.  Sandie's dream is a nightmare that will leave her looking at the business end of a knife.  This stab into reality will haunt Ellie until she learns what happened to Sandie and the man responsible.<br/><br/>This film mixes the paranormal with teen drama and mystery. As Ellie looks at Sandie's life through Sandie's eyes, Ellie is envious of Sandie's tenacity.  When she learns the path Sandie's life spiraled into, Ellie stands outside of Sandie's body. Being on the outside allowed Ellie to be more critical of Sandie instead of admiring her. The film transports you when Ellie flashes back to Sandie's life. And the edits between Sandie and Ellie are flawless.  When Sandie's end comes across the scene, it will be a poetic justice you were not expecting.  While the film does feel long and has an unnecessary romance, it is highly entertaining and will make you want to do a double-take.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Barney Pudowski is a middle schooler with no friends, and his old friends, Savannah, Rich, Ava, and Noah, make friends based on their B-Bot matches.  Marc Weidell created B-Bots for the company Bubble.  The B-Bot connects to the Bubble Network, downloads the owner's information, and finds friend matches based on compatibility. Within months Bubble sold millions of B-Bots, except to Barney.  Barney's dad, Graham, is a single, hard-working parent. After seeing Rich and his friends tease Barny about not having a B-Bot, Graham rushes to the Bubble store, but three things stop him from buying the B-Bot.<br/><br/>The store's closed, there is a three-month waiting list, and people can only purchase it online.  Defeated, Graham starts to walk away, but he sees a loading truck loading more B-Bots into the store.  He overhears the truckers say a B-Bot fell off the delivery truck and got damaged.  Graham purchases the damaged B-Bot from the trucker and gives it to Barney. Barney puts his hand on the B-Bot, and it has trouble reading Barney's hand scan.  After several attempts, the B-Bot scans Barney but doesn't complete its download or connection to the Bubble Network.<br/><br/>After several mishaps, Barney decides to take the B-Bot back to the store and exchange it for a new one without telling Graham.  On their way to the store, the B-Bot, named Ron, sees boys playing on the playground and decides to make friends with them. Barney knows the boys on the playground because they are his bullies.  When the bullies attack Barney, Ron beats up the bullies. Elated with his new defender, Barney decides to keep Ron and teach Ron how to be a friend.  Too bad that the video of the attack when viral.  Now Bubble knows it has a rogue B-Bot on its hands that scares parents and intrigues kids.  They have to find and destroy Ron before his code spreads.<br/><br/>This movie is I, Robot, The Social Network, and Big Hero 6 combined, and everyone in your family will love it.  While it entertains, the plot covers complex issues like social anxiety, viral celebrity, online bullying, and friendship. Now, don't be surprised if your child wants a B-Bot in the beginning.  However, by the end, it will change.  Also, the story gives insight into the inner workings of tech companies.  Often privacy and safety come second to profits, no matter how good the intentions. So get the family together and enjoy this film.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Paul Atreides wakes up from another dream about a young Freman woman.  While he lies to his mother, Lady Jessica, about the visions, he practices his voice with her.  Paul, like Jessica, has telepathic abilities, but they have to find the right tone to command people to do what they say.  After the lesson, Paul meets with his mentor Duncan.  Paul requests to go on Duncan's next mission, but Duncan says no. Later, Paul tells his father, Leto, the ruler of Caladan, that he is not ready to lead. Paul attends Leto's takeover of the Arrakis from the House of Harkonnen, ruled by Baron Vladimir.  Leto's faction will have control of the 'spice' produced by Arrakis.  'Spice' extends the human lifespan and is a critical element for interstellar space travel. While Vladimir hands over Arrakis freely, he does it with a trick up his sleeve.  Vladimir weakened the spice harvesters, created a plan to kill Paul, and added a mole in the House of Atreides. Paul will have to step into Leto's shoes and use all of his training to save Atreides, his family, 'spice,' and the Fremen.<br/><br/>Based on Dune by Frank Herbert, this remake is one of the finest visual movies of all time.  Viewers become engrossed in Frank's world with the costumes, scenes, creatures, and machinery. Seeing a film of this scale on a large screen is a must.  You can not be late for this movie.  The first 10 minutes cover the entire backstory for each house and the importance of spice.  Now what they gave the audience in visual effects, they lost in some of the audio.  The internal voices in Paul's mind become hard to understand when several voices overlap. Understandably, producers wanted the fighting scenes and sound effects to be grand, but it shouldn't come at the cost of dialog.  While you won't pay to see it again, you will be glad you saw it in theaters. But don't wait too long, because part 2 is in the works.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Last Duel",
    "review":"Marguerite de Carrouges sits stone-faced at the dinner table with her husband, Sir Jean de Carrouges, and mother-in-law. Once in the bedroom, he tries to have sex, but Marguerite refuses. Before he left, Jean told Marguerite not to leave the house nor be alone because it wasn't safe.  However, Marguerite's mother-in-law departed and took all the servants.  A man Marguerite knew came to the door, and she let him in.  But she didn't see Jacques Le Gris standing by the door.  When Marguerite opened it, both men came in.  Jacques declared his love for her, but she refused him.  Then, Jacques raped her. Jacques used his power to gain the land promised in Marguerite's dowry and took Jean's captain position under Count Pierre d'Alençon. Jean thinks Jacques raping his wife is another slight against him.<br/><br/>Jean knows that Pierre will reject any charges because Jacques is his friend.  So, Jean uses gossip to have the charges tried in a church trial.  During the proceedings, Jean lays down his glove to declare a duel to the death to prove Marguerite is telling the truth, and Jacques accepts. The judge tells Marguerite that she will be chained with an iron collar, tied to a post, whipped, and burned alive. With her life in the hands of Jean, Marguerite declares that she told the truth and she will suffer any fate of the duel.<br/><br/>Based on The Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal, and Trial by Combat by Eric Jager and inspired by actual events, the writer tells this plot in three chapters.  The first chapter is Jean's truth. The second chapter is Jacques's truth. The final chapter is Marguerite's truth. Watching the same events from different perspectives allows you to see the events through someone else's eyes. So pay attention.  With that said, this movie should come with a trigger warning for sexual assault survivors.  It depicts Marguerite's rape twice. While the costumes and performances were accurate, you won't leave the movie feeling like you want to see it twice.  But the gruesome battles and duels make the film worth seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After taking down Spectre, Bond retired the spy's life for a quaint life with Madeleine. Bond goes to Vesper Lynd's tomb but quickly finds himself under attack.  One of his attackers says that Madeleine is the daughter of Spectre. Five years later, Felix leaves a clue for Bond to find him.  Bond locates Felix, and Felix tells Bond that someone kidnapped a Mi6 scientist named Valdo Obruchev. Bond says no and leaves, but his car won't start.  A woman, whom he bumped into at the club, offers him a ride.  At his home, the woman reveals her name is Nomi, and she is the new Double-O-7. While Bond believes Spectre and Blofeld are behind the plot, they are merely puppets.  The puppet master will collide Bond's past with his future while uncovering Madeleine's secrets.<br/><br/>The follow-up to Spectre picks up where the last movie left off.  Bond enjoys a peaceful existence without love.  When Bond gets back into action, he is petal to the metal.  But he has the problem every seasoned vet deals with: Fresh Recruits.  They are fawning or attempting to squash his mythical accomplishment.  While the movie is entertaining and puts a chef's kiss on several characters, it's too long.  The editors could remove 30 to 45 minutes of this film and still create an entertaining movie. If you are a fan of this series, you will thoroughly enjoy this film at maximum cost and IMAX.  Otherwise, see it at the matinee price.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
