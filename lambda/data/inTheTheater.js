    "mtitle":"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum",
    "review":"Winston gives John 1 hour to get his affairs in order.  Then he will be excommunicated and a bounty of $14 million will be placed on his head.  Every assassin in the world will be after him and no one will offer help.  John uses the hour to find a safe place for his dog, get a ticket, get a marker, and get some gold coins.  Since some assassins couldn't wait for an hour, John needed to seek medical treatment.  In the middle of getting stitches, John's time runs out and the doctor stops the work.  John has to complete is stitches and heads to the Director.  He asks the Director to give him passage to Casablanca.  He knows an assassin there who can lead him to the High Table.  He hopes to plead his case so the High Table will let him live.<br/><br/>This movie proves better weapons, excellent choreographed fights, and mind blowing cinematography is all action lovers need.  With so much going on, this movie provides 30 to 45 minutes of dialogue.  It gives you more of John's training history with the Director but not enough information of the blood oath between him and Sophia.  Seeing John Wick 2 is necessary for this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Natasha has to leave the US after ICE discovers her family are undocumented immigrants.  She has an 8 a.m. appointment to speak to U.S. Immigration.  Daniel is a 1st generation American who follows his parents' dream.  He has an interview for a college recommendation this morning.  With 2 appointments, 1 jacket, and the most benevolent star, these 2 will meet.  After saving her life, Natasha gives Daniel 1 hour to prove love exists.  But she doesn't tell him this will be her last day in New York.  This will be an hour of destiny.<br/><br/>While this movie deals with real world issues, it doesn't get too heavy or become a political satire.  It remains a teen love story that provides the most realistic view for this relationship.  It is fun to watch at full price, but you won't have an immediate urge to buy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Ethan knows it will work because Bailey was reincarnated several times during his childhood.  With a new mission, Bailey will come back as different dogs to protect, love, and comfort CJ.<br/><br/>For this sequel, pull out your tissues and be ready to cry.

She decides to create a cheerleading club.  After an epic fail goes viral, they regroup with an enemy to compete in the biggest cheerleading competition on the south coast.  But Martha is keeping her cancer diagnosis a secret.<br/><br/>This movie is funny, inspiring, and a lesson for everyone on how to treat our elders.  While Martha is the heart of the group, Sheryl is the backbone.  Her wit, charm, and determination is the guiding force behind Martha.  Seeing it full price is worth it but you won't have the urge to buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Josephine is impressed with Penny skills as a small-time con-artist but she wants her out of the way.  Josephine is a big-time grifter with her eyes on larger marks.  And having another con-artist in the area could ruin her plans.  So after trying to get rid of Penny by training her, they place a wager.  They have to con the same man.  Who ever cons him first wins $500,000 and gets to stay.<br/><br/>This movie is only watchable due to Rebel's physical comedy.  She carries the movie while Ann's accents all sound the same.  If you are a fan of Rebel, see it matinee.  Otherwise, wait for FandangoNow.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
