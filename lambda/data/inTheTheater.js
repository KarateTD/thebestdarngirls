    "review": "Ben asks his old boss, Richard, to remove him from the blacklist. Ben can't find work with the scarlet letter on his record, and his daughter, Cathy, is sick. However, Richard won't change his mind because Ben spoke to union leaders about his working conditions. Ben will remain on the list.<br/><br/>Ben watches game shows with Cathy until his wife, Sheila, returns home. She wants to spend time with Cathy, but changes her mind after feeling Cathy's fever. He hates that she has to flirt with wealthy men for tips, especially after one client killed her co-worker. He gets an idea. He will go to the network building and be a contestant on one of their shows. Sheila rejects the idea because she fears he will try out for The Running Man. Ben assures her he would never try out for that game before leaving.<br/><br/>Ben walks through the gates of the network building. They pull up his work history and tell him to go to elevator 26. Hopeful contestants, Jenni and Tim, greet Ben. The Network showrunners perform physical and psychological tests on the contestants. To Ben's surprise, they picked him to be on the Running Man. Ben tries to force them to change, but they refuse.<br/><br/>Ben meets with the Network owner, producer Dan. Dan shows Ben the lucrative contract. He gets a bonus for every day he remains alive and a $500 signing bonus. Ben signs the contract and assures Dan he will be the first contestant to go the distance.<br/><br/>Dan introduces Ben, Tim, and Jenni to the show's hosts, Bobby T.. Bobby gives a quick hello before running on the stage. Ben rages at the false narrative Bobby spins to make the fans hate him. Then, Bobby gives the rules. The runners will have a 12-hour head start. The further they go, the more money they will make. They have to film themselves every day for 10 minutes and drop it in a mailbox. If they don't, they won't get the money, but the hunters will still come after them. They have to last 30 days. Ultimately, they will receive $1 billion. Will he survive the Running Man and make it home to his family?<br/><br/>Based on The Running Man by Steven King, this film has a spectacular pace, wild stunts, and a fresh twist on a familiar plot. This film isn't just about a man running for his life. It's a searing indictment of media manipulation by corporations. The director uses different camera techniques to capture Ben's runs. It could be a steady drone camera shot, a GoPro-style shot, a handheld camera shot, or standard movie framing. These changes display an enticing view of Ben and his run. The soundtrack stays in step with Ben's speed and gets you excited. The action slows with a purpose. It speaks to corruption, pollution, and screen addiction. The plot delivers these messages without getting too topic-heavy or self-righteous. This film is an exciting and violent ride.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Now You See Me: Now You Don't",
    "review": "The four horsemen - Atlas, Jack, Henley, and Merritt - return to the stage after 10 years apart in Bushwick, New York City. They bring an audience member, Roscoe, on stage and possess his body. In Bosco's body, they find a man in the crowd who uses cryptocurrency to swindle people out of their pensions and retirement funds. They use their magic to steal his money, redistribute the wealth, exit Bosco's body, and flee the scene. The cryptobro jumps on stage and realizes the four Horsemen were a hologram. Bosco escapes with his friends, June and Charlie, and laughs. They return to their hidden apartment and gloat about their trick. Bosco asks Charlie to turn off the Atlas hologram. However, it remains. It's the real Atlas. He got a card from The Eye asking him to find the three magicians and run a new trick with them. The Eye wants Atlas to steal Veronica Vanderberg's Heart Diamond for $500 million. She uses her business to launder money for the world's worst criminals.<br/><br/>Veronica prepares to show off her family's diamond for the first time in 25 years. She assembles outfits for a photoshoot when someone calls her. The scrambled voice tells Veronica that they want the diamond. If she doesn't hand it over, they will expose her family's dark secrets. Veronica joins her party and sees Atlas. She assumes he was the threatening caller. He, Bosco, June, and Charlie steal the diamond. When they run away, Jack jumps with razor-sharp cards. Then, Henley joins them in battle. When cornering the Horsemen, the security guards start to play an air violin. Merritt jumps out and takes out the remaining guard. The original four Horsemen, Bosco, Charlie, and June, escape onto a boat and discuss what's next. Then, Charlie notices their playing cards combine to make a map of a French Château. Jack and Merritt don't want to go because their last trick landed Dylan in a Russian prison. Atlas convinces them to perform one more trick.<br/><br/>They enter the dwelling and find a treasure trove of magical history. Thaddeus appears because the Eye sent him. Charlie looks around and realizes they are in Jasper Maskelyn's home. The team believes the Eye wants them to do the same thing. They will do everything in their power to shut down Veronica's operation and find a new home for the diamond.<br/><br/>This third installment contains the sleight of hand fans love with razzle-dazzle fight scenes and an overarching story. The plot lets the audience know that the Horsemen have moved on with their lives. The writers presented the new magicians with a quick backstory. This picture globe hops and offers new tricks. The best scene is watching the elder and new magicians attempt to trick each other. Nothing will be as good as the first, but this installment was better than the second. It was funnier, bigger, and more magical. The edits were a bit jumpy, but it doesn't lose its magic. It's worth your time at the theaters, but you won't buy the DVD.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sarah's Oil",
    "review": "Sarah Rector was free and a descendant of Creek Natives. After the Treaty of 1866, she was in a unique position to acquire 160 acres of land at the age of 11. Sarah walked into the office and signed her name proudly. Her parents, Rose and Joseph, want to sell her land because they can't pay the $30 property tax. However, Sarah has other plans. She convinces her father to ask local oil companies to drill on her land. He relents.<br/><br/>Joseph approaches several oil companies, but most won't let him walk into the front door. He asks Sarah to wait outside while he speaks to Devnan at Pan Oklahoma Petroleum. Sarah walks into Busy Bee Café and asks for water. However, the waitress points to the whites only sign. Then, Bert Smith offers to buy Sarah a lemonade. Sarah thanks Bert before leaving. She storms into Devnan's office and demands a deal. He will rent the land for six months. If he finds oil, he will give Sarah royalties. She agrees.<br/><br/>After three months, Devnan says the well is dry and wants to end their deal. Later that night, someone tries to buy it from Sarah, but she says no. Sarah marches to a day worker area and spots Bert. She asks him to help her drill on the land. Sarah believes Devnan lied when he said it was dry and that the buyer was working for him. Bert surveys the area and discovers that Devnan set up oil drills around Sarah's property. He knows she has oil and barrels of it. They become partners and start drilling. Sarah has a target on her back. Can she keep what's hers?<br/><br/>Sarah is a no-nonsense individual with strong faith and a solid educational background. This film, based on a true story, covers Jim Crow Laws, twisted guardianship, and the murders of indigenous child landowners. It covers the history without the gory details. The writers explain the law in a way that young tweens can understand. The script injects humor to keep the story jovial. This film tackles a sensitive history with a light touch, and it entertains with humor and faith.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Die My Love",
    "review": "Jackson and Grace move from New York to live in the home of Jackson's recently deceased uncle in Montana. While Jackson works on the road, Grace will stay home and write her novel. Soon, Grace is pregnant with their first baby. But Jackson's mother, Pam, can see the 1000-yard stare in her eyes. Pam reassures Grace that fear, confusion, and sadness are common during pregnancy. Jackson and Grace aren't prepared for the changes she will go through after she gives birth. It will have a lasting effect on their marriage.<br/><br/>The beginning shot fills the screen and envelops the audience in fire. Once Jackson and Grace move in, the black bars appear on the side, giving the audience the boxed-in feel. You can feel the isolation and despair. But that's where it ends. The director has stepped so far into artistry that the film becomes disjointed and confusing. You will leave the theater wondering what happened, what you watched, and why you were supposed to care. The film gets lost in flashy imagery with no substance, like Mother!. See this film if you are into symbolism.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Regretting You",
    "review": "Seventeen years ago, Jonah drove to a gas station with his girlfriend, Jenny, his best friend, Chris, and Chris's girlfriend, Morgan, to get alcohol. Morgan stealthily acquired a pregnancy test and headed to the bathroom. At the beach, Chris tries to get Morgan to drink, but she refuses. Jenny and Chris leave Morgan and Jonah to play beer pong. Then, Morgan confesses to Jonah that she's pregnant.<br/><br/>Today, Chris and Morgan are married and have a daughter named Clara. Jonah left town for college and never looked back until a year ago. He met up with Jenny, had a one-night stand, and she got pregnant. Now, they have a baby boy named Elijah. Clara calls Jenny and asks her to keep a secret. Jenny promises, but puts the phone on speaker so Morgan can hear. Clara spent the evening with the cutest boy in school, Miller, and gave him a ride home. However, Clara discovered that Miller has a girlfriend, Shelby. Jenny warns her to stay away from him. Clara relents.<br/><br/>Jenny's maternity leave is over, and Morgan will watch Elijah for her. Clara pulls Jenny aside for more boy advice. She warns Clara to be careful around Miller. Chris honks so Clara can move her car. Clara picks up her friend, Lexie, and drives to school. Lexie heard a rumor that Miller broke up with Shelby after Shelby accused him of cheating on her with Clara. Clara lets her fantasies wander until he gives her the cold shoulder. She texts Jenny for clarity. Jenny warns Clara not to be the 'other girl' and to 'trust her' about the situation. Clara asks if Jenny was the other girl and starts text-bombing her for details. Jenny never replies.<br/><br/>Morgan receives a call from the hospital that Chris was in an accident. She runs to his job, and Jonah rushes in behind her. He received a similar call about Jenny. They discovered that Jenny and Chris were in the same car and that he was driving. Sadly, they passed away. Something plagues Jonah. He doesn't know why they were together. Jonah starts to say a hurtful truth, but Morgan won't let him for Clara's sake. However, the secrets could destroy her faster. Will the truth come out?<br/><br/>Based on Regretting You by Colleen Hoover, this film intimately portrays loss, love, and betrayal. However, it isn't the tear-jerker the audience expects. The script inserts enough humor and love to break apart the sadness. And Lexie has perfect comedic timing, inflection, and pacing. The actress dominates every scene she's in. The movie's pace is steady, and every character has a proper conclusion. It's not appropriate for tweens, but better suited for older teens. Audiences should give this film a chance at the matinee unless they are sticklers for book accuracy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
