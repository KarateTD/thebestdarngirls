    "review":"A mobster, Lorenzo, drives into his property to find dead bodies everywhere. He tells his young son to stay in the car. A nervous man with a gun tells Lorenzo the culprit is waiting in the cellar. He is Robert McCall. Robert gives Lorenzo seconds to decide his fate. Lorenzo takes too long, and Robert kills him and Lorenzo's remaining goons. Robert walks outside, sees Lorenzo's son in the truck, and tells the boy to stay put. When Robert turns his back, the boy shoots Robert, but Robert survives.<br/><br/>A local <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte carabinieri, Bonucci</lang>, finds Robert unconscious in his car with a large gunshot wound and takes Robert to a doctor, Enzo. When Robert wakes up, Enzo asks Robert if he is a good man or a bad one. Robert answers that he doesn't know and passes out. Three days later, Robert wakes up and insists on walking around. Enzo warns him to take it slow.<br/><br/>Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA agent Emma Collins. Robert alerts Emma to Lorenzo's operation and hangs up. As Robert heals, he captivates the <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte</lang> citizens, finds peace in the small community, and puts his watch away. However, Camorra members disrupt Robert's ease when Robert sees them taking protection money from the businesses. Robert tries not to intervene, but they go one step too far. And Robert puts on his watch of fate. He will rid <lang xml:lang='it-IT'>Altamonte</lang> of the Camorra while Emma follows Robert's lead to the notorious crime syndicate.<br/><br/>The third and final movie of the Equalizer franchise doesn't disappoint. It starts with the bloody aftermath of Robert's rampage and then jumps into the action. The movie balances humor, heart, and bloodlust with precision and ease. The movie gives you a brief flashback into the first film while giving a quip to the second. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and brutal. In between Robert's fighting and mingling, Emma uncovers a mystery with Robert's guidance. This fast-paced movie requires your attention, but you don't need to see the first 2 to watch this gem.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Matt talks to his boss, Anders, because their client lost 3 million euros and 24 hours. Now, the client wants to pull their money out, and Anders wants Matt to persuade the client to stay. Matt agrees while walking out of his gym. Matt's wife, Heather, reminds Matt that he promised to take the children to school this morning because she needed to see her friend. Matt calls his daughter, Emily, and son, Zach, downstairs. Matt begs Zach to get in the car. Zach yields.<br/><br/>Matt hears a phone ringing and assumes it's Emily's or Zach's. It's not their ringtone. Matt looks inside the armrest and finds a mobile phone displaying an unknown number. Matt picks up the phone, and the person on the other end tells him to follow instructions. Or he will blow up the car. The voice on the phone warns Matt not to get out of the car. The seats have a pressure plate. If Matt and his children want to get out alive, Matt has to do what the voice says. Matt will spark a police chase, panic, and a conspiracy.<br/><br/>This movie will make you hold your breath as Matt runs into dangerous and sad obstacles. The core of this film asks: How well do you know someone? Like any high-octane film, the police are clueless and barely look beyond the surface. If you watch these action-packed nail-biters, you can pick out the culprit after seeing this person in one critical scene. This latest action flick is thrilling, but once is good enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"<lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime Reyes</lang> returns home to his family after finishing his pre-law degree. His family anxiously awaits his arrival, but his sister, Milagro, wants the family to be honest with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang>. Their father, Alberto, and mother, Rocio, tell Milagro to wait until <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> eats to give him the unfortunate news.<br/><br/>After <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes his first bite, Milagro tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> that his parents must sell their home. And Alberto had a heart attack. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> uncle Rudy blames Kord Industries for the gentrification. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> promises to find a job and move the family to a big house on the hills.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro got a job cleaning pools to make ends meet. As they scrape gum off the pool furniture, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> spots Veronica Kord and her private security, Ignacio, walking inside the home. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> can't work up the nerve to ask Veronica for a job, but Milagro has no problems using Veronica's bathroom.<br/><br/>Jennifer pulls her aunt, Veronica, into a room and watches an ad for the One Man Army Corp, a.k.a. OMAC. Jennifer reminds Veronica that Jennifer's father, Ted, didn't want Kord Industries involved in weapons manufacturing anymore. Veronica demands that Jennifer back off. Jennifer walks towards the door to exit, and Ignacio tries to grab her, but <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> verbally defends Jennifer. Veronica fires <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and Milagro. Jennifer tells <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> to come to Kord Industries, and she will find a job for him.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> arrives with his cheering family in tow. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> sees Jennifer running down an escalator and onto an elevator. He mirrors her movements and meets her downstairs. She hands <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> a burger container. She demands that he guard it with his life and never open it.<br/><br/><lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> takes it home, and his family encourages him to open the box. They all play with the high-tech scarab inside. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> touches it, it scans his face, goes inside his body, and attaches to his spine. When <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> wakes up, he is on his parents' couch naked. <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> steals Rudy's car to get answers from Jennifer. After dodging a hail of bullets, Jennifer sits with <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> family to explain. The scarab is a world-destroying weapon that chooses its hosts.

Second, <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> is a reluctant hero. Finally, his family doesn't sit around waiting for <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> to save them. The graphics are stellar for a DC film. This color palette of the film reflects <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime</lang> and his family. It's fun, bright, and burst with excitement. The downside of this movie is the sound effects drown out <lang xml:lang=\"es-ES\">Jaime's</lang> suit's A.I., Khaji-Da. See this film on the best screen possible, and don't let the detractors keep you away. Also, there are mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Doug's girlfriend spots puppies for sale outside a general store. She instantly falls in love with one, Reggie, but Doug hates him. She cares for the dog until Reggie pulls another woman's underwear out of Doug's bedroom. She tries to take Reggie, but Doug won't let her out of spite. One day, Doug receives an eviction notice and blames his mother because her check is short. Doug packs his things, and Reggie accidently knocks over the boxes to get a ball. Seeing that Reggie broke his favorite bong, Doug decides to remove Reggie. He thinks he's free of Reggie, but Reggie always comes back.<br/><br/>Doug has had enough of Reggie coming back, so he drives Reggie 3 hours away. Reggie finds the ball but has difficulty maneuvering out of the alleyway. So he rests before returning to Doug. Reggie attempts to leave the alley, but two rottweilers accost him. Then, a large shadow appears on the building and terrorizes the rottweilers. The rottweilers stop chuckling when Bug babbles with crazy thoughts and threats against them and himself. Bug sadly listens to Reggie's tale and gives him gut-wrenching news: Doug abandoned him.<br/><br/>Bug introduces Reggie to two of his friends, Maggie and Hunter. Bug tells Reggie that being off the leash is a blessing. Strays can do whatever they want. After spending the day off the leash with Bug, Maggie, and Hunter, Reggie thinks about Doug and their relationship. He is going back to Doug. Not to play. But to bite off his dick. Bug, Maggie, and Hunter will help Reggie find Doug and exact revenge.<br/><br/>This movie is not for children. It depicts animal neglect, a man pleasuring himself, and overt sexual content. It has Ted-like humor with animal cuteness. The writers stay within the minds of dogs. They sniff each other, fear fireworks, and have a strange view of humans. As you watch, it's easy to forget the story's heart. Be kind to dogs. If you are not into crass humor, this isn't your movie. Otherwise, see this movie at the matinee price.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

  "review":"Merlin loves to perform magic with his best friend, Robin. Robin will be his assistant for the upcoming talent show. Merlin worries this will be the last time they see each other because Robin will attend Julliard in the fall. Robin gives him a quick peck and promises to be his friend for life. But he wishes they were more than friends.<br/><br/>Merlin got the most coveted spot in the talent show. During his escape trick, Merlin asks a member of the Ghetto Gangsters to secure his handcuffs. They pull his pants down and expose his large appendage for the entire auditorium. Embarrassed, Merlin runs off the stage, leaving Robin alone.<br/><br/>Merlin performs his illusions but as a clown for kids' parties. It's been four years since he's seen Robin, and he's ready to tell her how he feels about her. He goes home to change, but Robin is already there with her new boyfriend, social prankster Blaze. Then, Blaze proposes to Robin, and she accepts. Merlin announces to the crowd that he is moving to Las Vegas to become a magician. However, instead of scolding Merlin, Verna buys him a one-way ticket and asks her friend, Rita, to let Merlin stay at her hotel.<br/><br/>Merlin arrives at the rundown hotel and tricks Rita into letting him perform on her stage. Along with the hotel, Rita runs a club called The Chip. Years ago, Rita had a male exotic dance team called The Chocolate Chips. The dancers were Mr. Face, Mr. Body, Mr. Slim, Dr. X, and the leader, Mr. Big. Merlin accidentally sets his pants on fire and tears them off during his routine. Mr. Big found his new leading man. He wants to get The Chocolate Chips back together and bring money to Rita's hotel and club. Can Merlin keep up the façade when his past crashes into his dance?<br/><br/>This movie had a few funny and shocking moments, but the plot dragged. Sadly, the film uses obvious props for children and doesn't make the best use of their comedians. Yes, this movie is comical. But it should have streamed on BET+, TV One, or Bounce TV instead of in the theaters. If you are a fan of the main cast, see it during the matinee. Otherwise, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
