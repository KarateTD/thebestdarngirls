    "review":"Sergeant Joshua Taylor lies in bed with his pregnant wife, Maya. They both lost family members in the A.I.-Human war. A.I. soldiers bring Sergeant Drew into Joshua's home. Joshua tells Maya to run upstairs and hide. With Maya out of earshot, Drew and Joshua laugh. Joshua whispers to his handlers to make Drew and the robots leave because they will blow his cover. Joshua hasn't discovered the location of Maya's father, the A.I. creator. Maya overhears the conversation and runs to the ocean. The secret force's sky base scans the area and drops a missile to keep Maya from telling her father. They maim Joshua and kill Maya and their unborn child.<br/><br/>Five years later, Joshua still has nightmares about that day. Joshua enjoys a late-night swim in his pool but comes to the surface when he sees Colonel Howell and General Andrews standing at the edge. They show Joshua evidence that Maya is alive and helping the creator make a new weapon. They want Joshua to find and destroy it. If he does, they will let him leave with Maya.<br/><br/>Joshua finds the weapon after an intense battle and approaches it alone. He puts his gun down when he sees the weapon is a female child sim. Sims are robots with donated human faces. Joshua shows the child a picture of Maya, and the child recognizes her. Joshua can't destroy the child because she can lead him to Maya and the creator. The child escapes with Joshua on her heels. They hide in a shack from Howell and her troops. When a gunshot compromises their location, Joshua finds an abandoned car and puts the child inside. He sees the markings 'Alpha Omega' on her mechanics and names the child Alphie. Joshua looks for the keys but can't find them. Alphie concentrates and starts the car. Alphie is unlike any other sim because sims are carbon copies of adults. Alphie, the first child sim, can grow and learn. Over time, she will grow to control any machine, from anywhere. Joshua is on a mission to find Maya, but Alphie will do much more.<br/><br/>This futuristic look into artificial intelligence is a startling view of today's world. Some humans don't understand what they created, so they fear it. Other humans live in peace with robots and join them to create a new society. For Sci-fi lovers, the twists are predictable. And the sound effects drown out the dialogue. Otherwise, the imagery is stunning, and the acting is superb. The bond between Alphie and Joshua deepens throughout the script and makes the audience hope for a loving solution. While you won't want to buy the movie, you will crave a part two for this soon-to-be cult classic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dumb Money",
    "review":"Keith Gill, a financial broker for MassMutual, meets with his friend, Briggsy, at a bar to discuss their investments. Keith admits that he invested $53,000 into GameStop. Briggsy can't believe it because hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, are shorting the stock. Keith goes home to his wife, Caroline, and baby girl. He posted his ideas on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, but no one listened. Caroline tells him to make another video. Keith walks to his basement, changes his shirt, puts on a red headband, and goes live as Roaring Kitty.<br/><br/>Jenny, a nurse, is a divorced mother of two and follows Wall Street Bets. She listens to Roaring Kitty and buys GameStop stock on the Robinhood app. Marcos works at GameStop and sees it struggling. Marcos decides to put a few dollars into GameStop after watching the stream. RiRi, a college student, has over $100,000 in student loan debt. She invested money into GameStop and encouraged others to do the same. Harmony listens to RiRi, watches Roaring Kitty, and starts to invest while falling for RiRi.<br/><br/>By January, Steve Cohen calls Gabe about GME. He warns Gabe that one person is driving up the buying. Gabe watches a few clips and doubles down on the short sale. Ken Griffin laughs at retail investors and calls them Dumb Money. The hedge fund managers aren't the only people watching GameStop. Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, owners of the Robinhood App, saw the number of users skyrocket. But none of them know that the Apes will expose Robinhood and cause a short squeeze that will spark a media frenzy, social payback, and a congressional hearing.<br/><br/>Based on The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, this movie mixes real-life events with a compilation of stories from retail investors. The plot doesn't describe how to short a stock, what hedge funds are, or what a short squeeze is. Instead, the audience gets to know the man behind Roaring Kitty. He ignited the masses and made investment companies take the Apes seriously. This film has engaging dialogue, great music, and realistic portrayals. It gives you an overview of the players, their jobs, and their net worth. The audience sees how they all fared at the end. They wanted to take down the system but became the product. So, sit back, take notes, and enjoy the social gamification of the market.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"PAW Patrol: The Might Movie",
    "review":"The Paw Patrol gets a distress call from the J and H Junkyard. Someone stole their 10-ton magnet and started a fire during the getaway. The pups save Janet and Hank but wonder why someone would steal it. They don't ponder for long because they want to run home to see the meteor shower over Adventure Bay. The crew readies the snacks as Ryder introduces them to The Junior Patrollers, Nano, Tot, and Mini. The meteor is heading toward Adventure Bay. They run to the town, secure everyone, and clear a path. Ryder and the pups go to the crater and find the meteor pulsating. Ryder decides to examine it in his lab.<br/><br/>The news reports that Victoria Vance pulled the meteor to Earth and broadcast her crime on social media. She used the powerful magnet to attract the meteor because something powerful was inside. The police find her post, arrest Victoria, and put her in jail. Her new cellmate is Mayor Humdinger and his cats.<br/><br/>A bright light wakes up Skye, and she walks towards it. She touches the meteor, and it shatters, leaving seven crystals behind. One crystal attaches to her collar, and Sky can fly. Each crystal latches on to them. Rubble becomes a wrecking ball while Chase gets super speed. Zuma can control and become water, while Marshall can shoot fireballs from his paws. And Zuma becomes Magneto. Liberty tries with all her might but doesn't have powers. Adventure Bay marvels at their upgraded heroes and plasters them all over the news. Victoria sees the report and vows to take back the pups' powers. Humdinger offers to help break Victoria out if she shares their abilities. Can the Paw Patrol defeat Victoria and Humdinger before she takes their powers?<br/><br/>Before the movie starts, their is a short music video, a Dora short, and Pup theater etiquette for the kids. This constant change may confuse younger viewers, so parents should be ready to explain. The film is good clean entertainment with lots of action. Also, it provides an origin story for Skye. The graphics and storyline are fun for the entire family. There are jokes for adults, but they are not innuendoes. The movie is comically self-aware and entertains without dumbing down the content or making inappropriate quips over kids' heads. Bring the entire family to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars for kids and 3.5 out of 5 stars for adults.",

    "review":"Barney goes to the home of Christmas's girlfriend, Gina, and patiently waits while they argue inside. Barney needs Christmas's help because he lost his lucky ring in a thumb wrestling match the night before. Christmas makes quick work of their rivals, and Barney exits with it. Then, they meet up with the crew for a new mission. Gunner and Toll Road prep the weapons, and Barney introduces the team to the new guys: Easy Day and Galgo's son, Galan. CIA agent Marsh strolls into the room after taking over for Drummer. A mercenary, Suarto Rahmat, plans to steal nuclear warheads in Libya. They think he is working with the elusive Ocelot. Ocelot is Barney's ghost. Twenty-five years ago, Barney and his team had a job to find Ocelot, but Ocelot killed Barney's entire crew. This time, Barney will return the favor.<br/><br/>After a hail of gunfire, blood, and dismemberment, Christmas has a choice. He can save Barney or get the warheads. Barney tells Christmas to get the explosives because Ocelot could use them to start World War III. Christmas disobeys the order and tries to save Barney, but Rahmat shoots Barney out of the sky and kills him. Christmas runs over to the plane and finds Barney's charred remains with Barney's signature ring.<br/><br/>The crew goes to the bar to celebrate Barney's life, and Gina meets Christmas there. She pulls him aside to talk. Christmas wants to know when they are going to avenge Barney. However, Marsh saunters in and tells Christmas he is out of the Expendables for disobeying a direct order. Also, Gina is taking Barney's place. Christmas gifts Gina his knife and asks Gina to kill Rahmat with it. Christmas wakes up in the morning, and Gina is gone. She and the team, along with Lash and Marsh, have Ocelot and Rahmat in their sight. Unfortunately, Rahmat knows they are on the way. Good thing Christmas is coming.<br/><br/>The fourth movie in The Expendables franchise has everything you expect: guns, fights, quips, and explosions. Most of your favorite leading men are gone, and the replacements have no backstories. Also, this movie has more sex and sexual tension than the others. With that said, this installment is funnier and gorier than the others. It pulls no punches with the devastating gunshots and lethal hand-to-hand combat. If you love the others, see this one in theaters. But casual fans should see it at the matinee price.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Hercule Poirot retires in Venice and avoids new cases with the help of his bodyguard, Vitale Portfoglio. Vitale runs to Hercule's rooftop with a message from a friend. Then, Vitale shows Hercule an apple, and Hercule knows that author Ariadne Oliver is there. An actress, Rowena Drake, hired a medium, Joyce Reynolds, to communicate with her deceased daughter, Alicia, in a séance. Alicia committed suicide after her fiancé, Maxime, left her and six months later became engaged to another woman. Ariadne was able to uncover fakes before but believes Joyce is the real deal. Ariadne is writing a book about Joyce, and proving Joyce wrong will make the book a best-seller.<br/><br/>Hercule, Ariadne, and Vitale arrive at Rowena's home and hear it's haunted history. Rowena opens her doors to let the children play on Halloween, but Leopold wants to read his book instead. Leopold doesn't want to participate in the activities because his father, Dr. Ferrier, suffers from trauma. Joyce arrives with her assistant, Desdemona Holland, wearing a cloak and mask. Before everyone walks into the salon, Rowena's housekeeper, Olga Semioff, screams at the front door. Maxime received an invitation to the séance and demands to attend.<br/><br/>Joyce puts a typewriter in the corner of the room, and Desdemona stands next to it. Joyce has Olga, Ariadne, Dr. Ferrier, Leopold, and Rowena surround her as she calls Alicia to speak from beyond the grave. Hercule stops the séance and exposes Joyce's fraud. Desdemona's half-brother, Nicholas, hid in the fireplace and signaled the typewriter. As Hercule readies to put the case to bed, windows fly open, and Joyce spends around uncontrollably speaking with Alicia's voice. She comes out of the trance and offers more information about Alicia's killer in the morning.<br/><br/>Privately, Hercule confronts Joyce for using Rowena's desperation for financial gain. Joyce he puts her mask and cloak on Hercule and tells him to do better than her. Hercule indulges in a children's game of bobbing apples, and someone pushes his face into the water. He wakes up to Vitale standing over him. Then, they all hear a scream and find Joyce impaled after someone threw her off a balcony. Hercule locks everyone inside the house and plans to investigate. Hercule doesn't believe in ghosts or God but starts to see and hear things around the house. Can Hercule uncover the killer before losing his mind?<br/><br/>Based on Hallowe'en Party by Agatha Christie, this movie starts with Hercule happily leaving the mystery world behind. The house has a horrid history with a plague, causing doctors and nurses to leave children to die. This tale leaves the plot open to ghosts with targets in their crosshairs. This film has plot points from Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. Hercule fans know to keep their eyes and ears open for every clue. And this time, you may spot the nugget of truth hidden in a brief exchange. This movie isn't the best, but you will leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
