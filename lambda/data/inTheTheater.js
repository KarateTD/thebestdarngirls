	"review":"In 24 hours, Miles Morales is bitten by a radio active spider, witnesses the death of Spider-Man, is hunted, and discover 5 other Spider-Men.  Each Spider-Men has their own back story, but they have one thing in common: Being a reluctant superhero.  Miles will sadly join this club.  Seeing the seemless mesh of different animation styles with a strong story and great life lessons for kids is superb.  Stay pass the end credits and look out for Stan Lee.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"Dr. Shirley hires Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga to drive him for his tour in the deep south.  Seeing prejudice there uncovers the prejudice feelings in themselves.  This movie is Oscar worthy with enough heart and life lessons to carry with you for a lifetime.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"Sara is the favourite of Queen Anne but that's challenged when her cousin Abagail becomes Sara's maid.  This back and forth between the too women is as sad as it is compelling.  It's hard to believe that people still fight to be the favourite of those in power today.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
