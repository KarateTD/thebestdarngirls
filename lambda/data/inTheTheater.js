The script gives you the horror stories of gig work, along with the community it builds. The comedic timing in this movie is stellar and goes for the educated laugh. The conclusion is beautiful. This movie starts like It's a Wonderful Life, but becomes much more. The theme is for the modern-day audience and touches the soul. The edits aren't smooth, but it doesn't distract from the message.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Roofman",
    "review": "The military discharged Jeff, and he lost his family after consistently breaking promises. During a custody exchange on his daughter's birthday, Jeff notices the inner workings of a local McDonald's. He wonders how many he would have to rob to get his family back. The answer was 45.<br/><br/>A year later, Jeff bought a home, and his family, wife, daughter, and twin boys, live with him. He hosts a birthday party for his daughter, Becky, but can't stop watching the news about the latest Roofman robbery. When a sketch appears on the screen, Jeff's friend, Steve, notices the similarities. Jeff opens the door to a slew of police officers. They arrest him, and the judge gives him 45 years in jail.<br/><br/>Jeff notices the inner workings of the prison and plans his escape by being helpful, kind, and quiet. He hides under a truck while it leaves the prison. Jeff contacts Steve, but Steve needs a month to get the documents. Steve tells Jeff to find a place to lay low. Jeff sees the Toys 'R Us across the street. Jeff makes himself at home.<br/><br/>One month later, Jeff calls Steve, but Steve signed up for a 6-month tour of duty. Jeff has to stay hidden until then. During his surveillance, Jeff learns passwords, more about the employees, and their unwavering boss, Mitch. Mitch relies heavily on Leigh. She is a divorced mom of two who loves church. Jeff steals toys from the store for the drive after hearing Mitch reject Leigh's toy requests. Later, the pastor's wife invites Jeff to a singles brunch.<br/><br/>Jeff arrives at the brunch and is the only man in attendance. He charms all the women but concentrates on Leigh. Over the next six months, Jeff will be the man he never thought he could be. Can Jeff go undetected without getting caught? And will he be able to leave it all behind when Steve comes home?<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie is both funny and charming, with a provocative edge. It's easy to look at Jeff as a folk hero, like Robinhood. The main character acknowledges his shortcomings in the opening sequence. He is an intelligent man who makes dumb choices. The set design department worked overtime recreating the store and hideaway. The designers incorporated the technology, music, and trends of the period. The director used natural lighting and practical sets to make the movie more authentic. This movie is reminiscent of Catch Me If You Can, but once is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Kiss of the Spider Woman",
    "review": "The guards take Luis Molina to his cell. He was arrested and charged with public indecency and lewd acts. He quickly turns the cell into a comfortable living area and attempts to converse with his new cellmate, Valentin Paz. However, Valentin doesn't want to talk. Luis determines everything he needs to know about someone by asking them one question: What is your favorite movie? For Luis, it's a musical called Kiss of the Spider Woman, featuring his favorite actress, Ingrid Luna. Against Valentin's wishes, the flamboyant Luis describes the movie in detail. Soon, Luis and Valentin use the retelling to escape their hell mentally. Their friendship grows, but this is a mistake. The warden promised to release Luis early if he got information about Valentin's group, loved ones, and upcoming protests. Can he get Valentin to open up without exposing himself? Or will Valentin change his heart?<br/><br/>This film balances the dark world of torture with the vibrant colors of a musical wonderfully. The dancing, singing, and costumes allow you and the characters to escape the painful reality and enjoy the beauty in their minds. As Luis tells the story, he replaces the two main male characters with himself and Valentin. This choice allows the audience to engross themselves in their narrative while drawing parallels between their lives and the musical. This film may win awards for its set design and storytelling. However, the actors' performances will take a backseat to the vanity department, editing, and direction. This film is for the big screen, but you won't have an urge to watch it again.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Tron: Ares",
    "review": "Julian Dillinger took over Dillinger Systems, founded by his grandfather, Ed Dillinger, after his mother, Elisabeth, stepped down. Today, Julian presents a revolutionary program. With lasers, he can shape any hardware the customer needs. If they can create the hardware, why not the human to control it? He presents Ares. A laser-printed, human-like AI program that follows commands. Julian and Elisabeth discuss the program after the potential buyers leave. She fears that Julian is moving too fast because the program can only live in the real world for 29 minutes. Julian is working on the permanence code, which will ensure they live until someone deactivates them. Elisabeth knows Julian isn't near his fix, but his biggest competitor, Eve, may be.<br/><br/>Eve Kim is the surviving CEO of ENCOM. She once headed the company with her sister, Tess, after their founder, Kevin Flynn, disappeared. Eve and her employee, Seth, search the most remote and coldest place in the world for Tess's off-site lab. Tess stored Kevin's old floppy disks there. Eve inserts each disk and examines its contents. She finds the permanence code.<br/><br/>Julian watches the news report about Eve's absence during the launch of ENCOM's latest game. With Eve and Ajay preoccupied, Julian hacks ENCOM's server for the permanence code. He sends Ares, Athena, and more soldiers to the ENCOM headquarters. He watches Eve's videos, reads her text messages, and scans articles about her. He starts to feel something. Ares wants to locate Eva, but only to keep the code for himself. Ares wants to live beyond the grid, but Julian doesn't plan to lose his biggest asset anytime soon.<br/><br/>This iteration of Tron has amazing costumes and stunning backdrops. The plot is intriguing because the writers secretly based it on Frankenstein's monster. The backing track is exciting and fresh, and the film has easter eggs for fans of the video game and the original picture. It is visually dynamic with a compelling script. However, the film drags. The fight scenes will bore you after 2 minutes. The film has one mid-credit scene for die-hard fans. You should see this film on a regular screen at the matinee price if you are a fan of the franchise.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Michael Kerr stands in front of a fighting audience for the first time in Brazil. To everyone's surprise, he wins his first match in a gauntlet-style face-off against a slew of professional fighters. He calmly accepts his prize with humility and grace. He returns home to his girlfriend, Dawn, but can't ignore his nagging pains.<br/><br/>Two years later, Michael battles in the Pride 7 Championship in Japan with his friend, Michael Coleman, and trainer, Bas, in his corner. Michael battles Igor Vovchanchyn, and Igor knees Michael in the head. But the referee doesn't call the foul. Instead, he hands Michael his first loss. Later, the officials change the referee's decision to a no-contest ruling. While this fixes the history books, it breaks Michael. He spirals out of control personally and professionally. He will lose it all to gain himself.<br/><br/>Based on the documentary 'The Smashing Machine,' this film adopts a documentary-style approach, featuring shaky cameras, confessionals, and in-ring grit. That perspective switches when Michael and Dawn are alone. The writers help the audience see this imposing figure as a gentle giant. The choreographers held nothing back with the fight scenes. They will make you flinch and cover your eyes. The lead made a stunning transformation to become Michael Kerr and proved his acting abilities. It's worth seeing in theaters, but you won't want to buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
