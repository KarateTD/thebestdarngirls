    "review":"In 1968 Chicago, Bill O'Neal stands outside Leon's bar and notices a cherry red GTO.  He goes inside, flashes an FBI badge, and starts body-searching the patrons.  When he finds the keys inside a man's pocket, Bill arrests the man for grand theft auto.  Another man looks Bill in the eye and recognizes him.  He knows Bill is a con-artist, not FBI.  Bill grabs the keys, jumps in the car, locks the doors, and drives off as the patrons try to stop him.  Later, the police catch Bill in the stolen car.  They arrest Bill and put him in a room for questioning.  FBI Special Agent Roy Mitchell tells Bill he will do 18 months for the robbery and five years for impersonating an FBI agent.  Or he can pick another option. Mitchell offers to drop Bill's charges if he becomes an FBI informant to gather intel on Frederick Hampton.  Fred is the chairman of the Black Panther Party of Chicago.  Under constant threat of arrest, Bill is the lynchpin to one of the darkest days in FBI, Black Panther organization, and American history.<br/><br/>While the title seems extreme, the story of Bill and Fred mirror that of Judas and Jesus.  Bill pretended to be a friend, traded information for money and died like Judas. You will notice that when Bill is the focal point, the camera follows behind him. When he is with others, the camera is always in front or on the side of him.  This change in camera angle helps the viewer change perspective mentally and visually.  The music, setting, makeup, technology, and clothing were in line with the period.  This movie and its dismal conclusion for everyone involved will stick with you.  Not only will you watch again, but you will also start researching the names that history tries to forget.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Edee follows her sister's advice and talks to a therapist.  After losing her son and husband, Edee considers taking her life.  Then Edee gets an idea to leave her life for a new existence.  She buys supplies, an old fashion cabin, and a trailer. For a few days, she tries to catch fish, hunt, and grow food, but the wildlife thwarts her.  Then a harsh winter comes, and Edee stops fighting, lays down, and prepares to die.  She wakes up with Miguel and Nurse Alawa by her side and an I.V. bag in her arm.  They nurse her back to health but don't seek further medical attention because Edee refused.  Alawa goes back to work, but Miguel stays. So Miguel offers to teach Edee how to survive off the land. By learning to survive the wilderness, Edee discovers how to fight for her life.<br/><br/>With lots of quiet contemplation scenes like Cast Away, this movie makes the most out of silence.  For 30 minutes, Edee is alone with her thoughts, struggles, and pain. You never know what happened to her husband and son, only that they died.  And you won't learn Miguel's need to help her until the very end.  The theater is a great place to enjoy the full majesty of the nature shots.  While this is an intriguing movie, you only need to see it once to appreciate it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1856 New York, Abigail tends to her chores and helps keep track of the family's income.  Her husband, Dyer, is a farmer and has a ledger of the crops, animals, debts, and earnings. However, when they have a daughter, Nellie, Abigail puts her writing focus on her child's needs.  At the age of five, Nellie died from an illness.  Heartbroken, Abigail pours her emotions into her quill and refuses to have any more children. As Abigail works in the garden, a carriage on its way to church passes her, and she sees a woman sitting up front that grabs her attention.  A few days later, the woman introduces herself as Tallie.  She is married to Finney with no children, and he runs the general store. Each time they meet, Abigail writes about the new feelings growing inside of her and the hold Tallie has on her mind.  While Dyer is curious about their relationship and Abigail's small lies, it's Finney that pieces it all together, and he will do anything to keep his wife and her wifely duties to himself.<br/><br/>While this movie has breathtaking cinematography, the plot bounces back and forth.  At first, this film starts with a forbidden love story.  Then, it switches to a murder mystery that isn't a mystery.  With a letter, it turns into a Lifetime movie.  Finally, it descends deeper into grief and madness. This movie is exemplary for its cinematography, costumes, and romance, but the overall story fails.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Captain Davis calls Sheriff Joe Deacon into his office.  A witness to a crime can't remember the attacker's face but remembers their boots.  A crime lab in L.A., Deacon's old stomping grounds, has them in their custody. When Deacon gets authorization from L.A. homicide, they will give the evidence to him.  Captain Farris welcomes Deacon back, but the current case is the focus of Deacon's attention.  Over two months, someone killed four people.  The details of the murders remind Deacon of a murder case that he had in L.A. several years ago.  Detective Jimmy Baxter briefs the press while noticing Deacon in the background. Jimmy invites Deacon along to investigate the latest murder. While Jimmy collects information on the victim, Farris calls Jimmy into his office.  Farris informs Jimmy that Deacon's captain cleared Deacon to leave, but he stayed in town and put in vacation time.  Farris believes Deacon stayed in town to work on the case quietly.  Jimmy finds Deacon, and they agree to work together and share information.  Deacon has one name high on his list of suspects: Albert.  Albert works at an appliance repair shop, and the last victim had an order to get her refrigerator repaired. Jimmy and Deacon will work together to get Albert.<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery that never solves itself. The movie starts as a whodunit and ends with one man redeeming another to redeem himself.  You leave the theater, or your couch, completely dissatisfied and confused with the ending.  With three award-winning actors at the helm of this project, you wish the script offered more. Save this movie for cable or background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

For the first 30 minutes, you feel like a child, in the backseat, listening to your parents bicker back and forth.  You want out of the car.  They never say what the disease is, and the plot leaves you wondering if it is dementia, Alzheimer's, or brain cancer. The heartfelt moments come at the end, but you don't care anymore. Skip the theaters, instead wait for it to be available on cable.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
