    "review":"Fire and water disappear from Arendelle and the wind wreaks havoc on the town. Queen Elsa gets the townspeople to safety. Grand Pabbie tells Elsa the Elemental Spirits in the Enchanted Forest want the truth to come out. Queen Elsa, Princess Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf walk to the Enchanted Forest. The mist hides the truth about Elsa's powers, Anna's strength, Kristoff's true north, and Olaf's knowledge. But can they sacrifice the world they know for the forgotten past?<br/><br/>First, you must see Frozen before you see this movie. Even though Olaf does an amazing recap, he misses some of the nuances. Second, you should see this movie in IMAX, 3D, or both if you can. This Disney movie is different because their isn't a real villain. This movie focuses more on correcting Arendelle's past with the people of Northuldra. Parents will laugh at some slick jokes while having a sense of nostalgia Kristoff's 90s power ballad styled music video. Kids will be engrossed in the action scenes. You won't regret seeing this one in the theaters.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
