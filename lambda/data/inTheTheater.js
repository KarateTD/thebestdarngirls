    "review":"After swim practice, Beth tells Hailey hurricane Wendy has changed course and headed straight for Florida.  Beth has been trying to call their father, Dave, all day but can't reach them.  Hailey searches for him but can't find him at his condo.  So, she goes to the family's old lake house.  There, she finds her dad wounded in the crawlspace of the home with 2 alligators.  To make matters worse, the hurricane floodwaters have swept alligators around their home and in the little safety of crawlspace is flooding.  Hailey and Dave have to find a way out without being eaten.<br/><br/>Talk about the worst day ever!  This movie is a mix of 47 Meters Down, Deep Blue Sea, and The Shallows.  Each smart step the pair try to take is met with another obstacle.  Even staying in the safe part of the crawl space means drowning.  The CGI alligators are well done and the kill scenes well executed.  This movie is a decent jump scare or a good laugh, depending on your level of the thriller movie experience.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Javed is harassed on the street and controlled at home.  While his factory-working father, Malik, wants Javed to be an accountant or lawyer, Javed dreams of being a writer.  After bumping Foop's cassettes on the ground, Foops lets Javed borrow them.  Javed can't believe a white American will have any idea what he goes through.  At the lowest point in his life, Javed turns on the cassette and presses play.  That pivotal decision will alter the course of his life forever.<br/><br/>Based on a memoir, this movie chooses the best Bruce Springsteen lyrics for critical moments in Javed's life.  He finds the courage to write, talk to a girl, and stand up to the haters.  Springsteen fans will fall in love while Javed goes through self-discovery with Bruce leading the way.  Like 'Yesterday', the music is more memorable than the movie.  Also, don't give up on Malik.  He is a strong man with a lot of pain inside.  You will like this movie but not enough to buy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After everyone was snapped back, people want the next Iron Man.  Spider-Man doesn't feel like he can step into Tony's shoes.  But Nick Fury needs him now.  The Elementals have invaded Earth.  The Wind and Earth elements were stopped by Mysterio.  With the assistance of Spider-Man, Mysterio was able to stop the water element in Venice.  Now, Nick wants Peter to go to Prague with Mysterio to stop the most powerful element, Fire.  Peter wants to enjoy his vacation with his friends, so he turns down Nick's offer.  Before Peter and his friends board the bus, the teacher informs them the trip got an upgrade and they are going to Prague.  Peter knows fury has hijacked their vacation.  With Tony Stark's Glasses and EDITH by his side, Peter will take on Fire.  But can Peter trust what he sees?<br/><br/>While Homecoming introduced us to a younger Spider-Man, Far From Home is his coming of age story without Iron Man by his side.  He has to figure out who he wants to be as a man and a superhero.  While the CGI has gotten better, you can still pinpoint moments where you are witnessing 100% CGI versus live-capture scenes.  There are 2 post credit scenes and a cameo that original Spider-Man fans will love.  See this movie in IMAX.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After a worldwide blackout causes Jack to be hit by a bus, he is the only person who remembers The Beatles.  He decides to jump start his failed singing career by passing off their songs as his own.  Within months, he is the most promising singer/songwriter in history.  But can he keep up the lie if it means losing Ellie?<br/><br/>This movie would be another boring romantic comedy if it wasn't for the music, Debra, and a special cameo.  If you are a fan of The Beatles, see the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Stu drives an Uber to help invest in his friends spin cycle business.  Hopelessly stuck in the friend zone, Stu wishes for more.  Vic is on a path to revenge after Tedjo murders his partner.  After having the case for 6 months, Captain McHenry tells Vic the Feds are ready to take over.  Angry, Vic gets Lasik and has lunch with his daughter.  Since he can't see and she is busy with her gallery opening, she downloads Uber on his phone so he can attend.  While Vic's eyes heal, Vic gets a call from his C.I. Leon.  Leon tells Vic Tedjo has a huge shipment coming today and the call drops.  Vic tries to drive to Leon but crashes his car.  He orders an Uber to take him to Leon's shop and gets Stu.  This ride will change these men's lives forever.  But whether or not it's for the better, is up to you.<br/><br/>Be ready to laugh until it hurts.  Don't make the mistake of calling this a buddy-cop movie.  Stu is not a cop and the two men are not friends.  This is a comedy with stunning action sequences and personal character growth.  This movie may not be appropriate for kids under 14.  In addition, there are no post-credit scenes.  If you are looking for the best laugh you will get in the theater, Stuber is for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
