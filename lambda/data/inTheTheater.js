    "review":"Aren can't generate interest in his yarn sculpture. So, the gallery owner cancels Aren's future art showing. Aren throws his art in the trash and walks to an ATM. Later, a drunken woman forgot her card in the machine and now screams someone stole it. Two men approach and assume Aren is the culprit. But the gallery bartender, Roger, jumps in and makes everything okay. The men and woman leave. Roger asks Aren to go with him to discuss what happened.<br/><br/>Roger noticed that Aren is uncomfortable around white people and becomes overly accommodating. He thinks Aren is the perfect fit for his company and offers Aren a job in client services. Gabbard teaches an introductory class about The American Society of Magical Negroes. Whenever a white person is secure, the world is safer for blacks. They'll all lose their magic if one doesn't put their client's needs first. Aren joins. The leader, Dede, accepts Aren and gives him a signature pocket watch.<br/><br/>Aren wakes up, and his pocket watch is ringing. Roger has his first assignment and wants him to come to work to gather intel. Aren stops at a coffee shop and bumps into a beautiful woman, Lizzie, spilling coffee on her. When Roger calls again, Aren excuses himself and leaves.<br/><br/>Aren's first job is for a graphic designer named Jason. Jason works at Meetbox, and his morale is dangerously low. Roger needs Aren to become his friend, uncover Jason's desire, and direct Jason toward that goal. During their first interaction, Lizzie walks past them. Lizzie and Aren stumble through their second encounter but remember to exchange names. Later, Aren learns that Jason admires and wants to be Meetbox CEO. Roger tells Aren to boost Jason's morale and give him the confidence to climb the corporate ladder. However, Aren notices that Jason's ascent comes at Lizzie's expense. So, Aren tries to spotlight Lizzie in Jason's eyes. Now, Jason wants Lizzie too. Roger tells Aren that Lizzie is off limits because dating her will put the client second and affect their magic. Now, Aren must help Jason get the job and the woman while suppressing his feelings. Can Aren? Should Aren?<br/><br/>This movie leans into the movie trope of the black person saving the day without giving insight into their struggles. The writer could create a searing critique of the films, but they make a comedy with a poignant moment of clarity for Aren and a twist ending. Aren is in a unique position because he doesn't acknowledge his discomfort, and he's bi-racial. Jason lived in a bubble of expected success. Lizzie, a person of color, wants to speak up but puts her desires second for the comfort of others. This film is funny and intriguing, but you won't need to buy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Kung Fu Panda 4",
    "review":"Po defends the Valley of Peace, while the Furious Five have individual missions around China. Master Shifu tells Po that Po must pick the next Dragon Warrior. Then, Po can become the spiritual leader. Po hears someone sneak into the temple and runs inside to defend the ancient weapons. He catches a bandit fox, Zhen, and puts Zhen in prison. Later, the valley's guards alert Po that Tai Lung is back from the spiritual realm for vengeance. Before Po leaves, Zhen hints that it isn't the real Tai Lung. It's the Chameleon disguised as Tai Lung. She is a sorceress and shape-shifter. Zhen believes Po won't be able to discern the Chameleon from the citizens or foes. So Zhen offers to help and get a reduced sentence in exchange. Can Po and Zhen defeat Po's most cunning adversary?<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 4 is the next step in Po's journey. He assumed Dragon Warrior was the peak of his Kung Fu training, but there is always more to learn. This script puts the Furious Five aside to introduce new characters and their backstories to the audience. This film offers comedy for adults and children without resorting to raunchiness or sly sexual innuendoes. And you don't have to watch the previous three movies to start this. While it's not the best of the franchise, it's not the worst. It's solid entertainment for the whole family with great animation worthy of the big screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, hide among the Freman people in the desert as word of their death travels through the houses. Stilgar pulls Jessica aside because he and other southern Freman believe Paul is there to fulfill the prophecy. A Reverand Mother is dying, and they want Jessica to take her place. Jessica says yes and goes through the deadly ritual but doesn't tell them she's pregnant. With her new status, Jessica will convince non-believing Freman that Paul is the Messiah.<br/><br/>Paul desires to learn the ways of the Freman. Stilgar gladly teaches Paul, and southern Freman delights in Paul's triumphs. However, a northern Freman, Chani, isn't impressed. She doesn't subscribe to the prophecy because she thinks it's an enslavement tool. Paul confides in Chani about his apocalyptic dreams as the two become inseparable. Paul's dreams warn that traveling to Southern Arrakis will bring death to billions.<br/><br/>Glossu Rabban Harkonnen sends spice harvesters and soldiers to the northern part of the Arrakis. Since the death of Duke Leto, Baron Vladimir Harroken wants his nephew, Glossu, to regain control of spice production. Vladimir thinks Glossu is a doting foot soldier but doesn't believe Glossu is ready to lead. Vladimir wants his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha, to take the throne. Emperor Shaddam IV's Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam, agrees. Shaddam's daughter, Princess Irulan, disagrees because Feyd-Rautha is a psychopath. Irulan keeps a secret. She suspects that Paul and Jessica are alive but unsure of their location. Can Paul and the Fremans stop the Harroken with the Emperor and his people secretly working for them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Dune by Frank Herbert and the sequel to Dune, this film deserves the most vivid screen and best sound an audience can find. The graphics are extraordinary and clean. The sound gives the script a proper build for its iconic moments. The story is captivating and dramatic. The script doesn't force its high-level wit on you and profoundly uses silence. On this surface, this movie is about empires fighting over a resource. However, this plot gently discusses religion and looting. This sequel is better than the first film and deserves your time and money. Its stunning fight scenes, jaw-dropping graphics, and compelling storyline are worth the running time.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
