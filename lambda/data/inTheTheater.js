    "mtitle":"Blinded by the Light",
    "review":"Javed is harassed on the street and controlled at home.  While his factory-working father, Malik, wants Javed to be an accountant or lawyer, Javed dreams of being a writer.  After bumping Foop's cassettes on the ground, Foops lets Javed borrow them.  Javed can't believe a white American will have any idea what he goes through.  At the lowest point in his life, Javed turns on the cassette and presses play.  That pivotal decision will alter the course of his life forever.<br/><br/>Based on a memoir, this movie chooses the best Bruce Springsteen lyrics for critical moments in Javed's life.  He finds the courage to write, talk to a girl, and stand up to the haters.  Springsteen fans will fall in love while Javed goes through self-discovery with Bruce leading the way.  Like 'Yesterday', the music is more memorable than the movie.  Also, don't give up on Malik.  He is a strong man with a lot of pain inside.  You will like this movie but not enough to buy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Spider-Man: Far From Home",
    "review":"After everyone was snapped back, people want the next Iron Man.  Spider-Man doesn't feel like he can step into Tony's shoes.  But Nick Fury needs him now.  The Elementals have invaded Earth.  The Wind and Earth elements were stopped by Mysterio.  With the assistance of Spider-Man, Mysterio was able to stop the water element in Venice.  Now, Nick wants Peter to go to Prague with Mysterio to stop the most powerful element, Fire.  Peter wants to enjoy his vacation with his friends, so he turns down Nick's offer.  Before Peter and his friends board the bus, the teacher informs them the trip got an upgrade and they are going to Prague.  Peter knows fury has hijacked their vacation.  With Tony Stark's Glasses and EDITH by his side, Peter will take on Fire.  But can Peter trust what he sees?<br/><br/>While Homecoming introduced us to a younger Spider-Man, Far From Home is his coming of age story without Iron Man by his side.  He has to figure out who he wants to be as a man and a superhero.  While the CGI has gotten better, you can still pinpoint moments where you are witnessing 100% CGI versus live-capture scenes.  There are 2 post credit scenes and a cameo that original Spider-Man fans will love.  See this movie in IMAX.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After a worldwide blackout causes Jack to be hit by a bus, he is the only person who remembers The Beatles.  He decides to jump start his failed singing career by passing off their songs as his own.  Within months, he is the most promising singer/songwriter in history.  But can he keep up the lie if it means losing Ellie?<br/><br/>This movie would be another boring romantic comedy if it wasn't for the music, Debra, and a special cameo.  If you are a fan of The Beatles, see the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

While Special Agent Leonard lets her go, he keeps an eye on her.  Her purse will lead her to a dangerous cat and mouse game.<br/><br/>This movie tries to be John Wick and the Atomic Blonde with the Tarintino Effect.  It falls short with 2 out of the 3.  The plot is unoriginal, boring, and extremely predictable.  This movie should have gone straight to TV.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Stu drives an Uber to help invest in his friends spin cycle business.  Hopelessly stuck in the friend zone, Stu wishes for more.  Vic is on a path to revenge after Tedjo murders his partner.  After having the case for 6 months, Captain McHenry tells Vic the Feds are ready to take over.  Angry, Vic gets Lasik and has lunch with his daughter.  Since he can't see and she is busy with her gallery opening, she downloads Uber on his phone so he can attend.  While Vic's eyes heal, Vic gets a call from his C.I. Leon.  Leon tells Vic Tedjo has a huge shipment coming today and the call drops.  Vic tries to drive to Leon but crashes his car.  He orders an Uber to take him to Leon's shop and gets Stu.  This ride will change these men's lives forever.  But whether or not it's for the better, is up to you.<br/><br/>Be ready to laugh until it hurts.  Don't make the mistake of calling this a buddy-cop movie.  Stu is not a cop and the two men are not friends.  This is a comedy with stunning action sequences and personal character growth.  This movie may not be appropriate for kids under 14.  In addition, there are no post-credit scenes.  If you are looking for the best laugh you will get in the theater, Stuber is for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
