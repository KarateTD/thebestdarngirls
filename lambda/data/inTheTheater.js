    "mtitle":"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",
    "review":"A year after King T'Challa died, Princess Shuri worked tirelessly to update Wakandan technology, but she stopped trying to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb. Her mother, Queen Ramonda, is fighting a political war with the United Nations. She will never share vibranium until the world is trustworthy. Ramonda returns home to make Shuri take part in a ritual. One year after a loved one passes, you burn your funeral ceremonial robe to honor them and relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>Shuri goes to the water's edge and watches Ramonda throw her robe into the fire, but Shuri refuses. Then, they notice a man coming from the water with wings on his ankles. Ramonda and Shuri dawn spears and demand to know who he is and why he speaks to them. He says his allies call him K'uk'ulkan, but his enemies say Namor. He says that Wakanda exposed his kingdom, Talokan, to great danger when they revealed the secret of vibranium. An American scientist was able to build a device that could detect the presence of the material. They want the Wakandans to bring them the American scientist so they can kill her, or they will destroy Wakanda.<br/><br/>Okoye decides to track down Agent Ross to reveal the location of the American scientist, and she convinces Ramonda to let Shuri go with her to get Shuri out of the lab. They unapologetically convince RiRi to come to Wakanda to keep her safe from a threat of unknown strength. However, Okoye and Shuri encounter hostile agents during their RiRi rescue, and Talokan warriors kidnap two of the women. Now, K'uk'ulkan gives Wakanda two options. One: Join his fight to destroy the land dwellers before they destroy his homeland for their resources. Or two: He will drown Wakanda and everyone in it.<br/><br/>And that's act one of this gut-wrenching, exciting, and loving tribute to Marvel's beloved king. The opening scene and the title card will have everyone in tears as it pays homage to a worthy figure in life and the comics. Then the plot introduces viewers to a new world with stunning but somewhat realistic imagery. You can see how this world mirrors Wakanda. Shuri and K'uk'ulkan are two sides of the same coin. They are children dealing with generational pain and devasting loss in a homeland under constant threat. RiRi is the new kid on the block. She swears, is an open book, and, while a bit naive, has some trust issues. It should go without saying, but the costumes, makeup, and art are second to none and help you delve deeper into this history-rich mythical world. Stay for the mid-credit scene, but their isn't an end-credit scene.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ticket to Paradise",
    "review":"Lily's divorced parents, David and Georgia, call Lily separately to confirm their seating arrangements. Lily tells them they will be on opposite sides of the auditorium during her law school graduation. She hangs up the phone and tells her best friend, Wren, that the graduation will be a disaster because her parents' seats are next to each other.<br/><br/>The two knick-pick at each other during the graduation but pretend to be all smiles when they meet up with Lily. They help Lily and Wren get to the airport for their trip to Bali. After waving goodbye to the graduates, David and Georgia agree not to see or speak to each other again.<br/><br/>After a few fun days, Wren and Lily go snorkeling. When they emerge from the water, they can't find the boat. It left without them. Then, they spot a man on a small watercraft and signal for help. The man, Gede, pulls Lily on it, and it's destiny. Gede is a seaweed farmer with distribution deals all over the world, and he loves his family and wants to continue his family traditions. Lily sees Gede's passion and realizes she never felt that way about the law. She went to law school to make her parents happy but loves Bali and Gede.<br/><br/>Thirty-seven days later, David calls Georgia about Lily's email. She decided to stay in Bali, marry Gede, and help him on the farm. She wants them to come to Bali for the ceremony. Georgia and David think Lily is throwing her life and career away for a flash-in-the-pan guy. They will act happy for Lily and Gede while sabotaging the marriage. Can they end one relationship before they destroy each other? Or will common ground bring them back together again?<br/><br/>This film is a Hallmark movie on steroids. David and Georgia's comebacks and one-liners are pure comedy platinum. And the conclusion is realistic and satisfying. However, the movie is too long. The editor could cut 20 to 40 minutes out of this movie and achieve the same goal. This movie is for you if you are a fan of these leading actors or romantic comedies. Otherwise, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Black Adam",
    "review":"Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was the first self-governed city of its kind. However, King Anh-Kot enslaved the people and forced them to look for Eternium. He wanted to use the crystal to create the Crown of Sabbac. When a slave finds the crystal, the other people descend upon him. A boy tells them to back off because they shouldn't fight amongst themselves. The boy runs away with the Eternium and starts an uprising. The king kills the boy to make an example of him, but the gods save him and give him the power of Shazam. The boy, now Teth Adam, returns to save Kahndaq, but the king has the crown. They have a battle that destroys the once-luxurious city.<br/><br/>Today, the people of Kahndaq live under the rule of the Intergang. Amon learned from his mother, Adrianna, that Intergang pillages their resources and pollutes their land while oppressing the people. Karim waits in the truck as Adrianna, Ishmael, and Samir explore the caves. Adrianna finds the crown, but Intergang comes in with guns. With a gun to her head, Adrianna tells the troops she will surrender the crown. However, she reads the inscription on the ground and summons Teth Adam. Teth Adam kills all but one of the Intergang troops and saves Karim and Adrianna. The surviving troop loads an Eternium-powered rocket and shoots Teth Adam. It injures him, and Adrianna brings Teth Adam and the crown home.<br/><br/>Teth Adam's presence alerted Amanda Waller, who calls Hawkman to capture Teth Adam and imprison him. He called Doctor Fate, a man who can read the future and perform sorcery with the magical Helmet of Fate. Next, Hawkman reached out to Atom Smasher. The last member of the team is Cyclone, and she is a tornado with a 167 IQ. The newly-formed JSA flies to Kahndaq to stop Teth Adam. Yet, Teth Adam isn't their only problem. They have a deadlier force looking for the crown, and they are willing to die and kill for it. It is their birthright.<br/><br/>Congratulations to DC for making the first adult superhero movie viewers can see. Teth Adam is one of the deadliest superheroes or antiheroes the D.C.E.U. has produced. Most of the CGI is well done and flows naturally with the script. However, the smaller Adam is distracting because the head is comically too big for the body. For viewers, being at the beginning sets up most of the surprises. The dialogue and slow-motion scenes have great comedic timing and accurately display everyone's strengths. This movie has one mid-credit sequence but no post-credits. Also, it sets up the future of the D.C.E.U. and is worth watching.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In Chicago, Illinois, Mamie walks into a department store with new shoes to find her son, Emmett, looking at wallets. Emmett pleads to get the wallet with a woman's picture inside. Mamie agrees to buy Emmett the wallet for his vacation to Money, Mississippi. Before he goes, Mamie warns Emmett that the rules in Mississippi are different than in Chicago. He must be on his best behavior, not anger white people, and remain small.<br/><br/>As Emmett boards the train with his Uncle Preacher and his cousins, Mamie worries because this two-week vacation is the longest they have ever been apart. In Money, Emmett plays around while his cousins work the cotton fields. They stop at a local store to hang out and get some refreshments. Emmett goes inside, buys two pieces of gum, gives the cashier, Carolyn, the money, and compliments her. Emmett's cousins see Carolyn run for her gun, so they get into their cars and drive away. Two men come into Preacher's home and threaten him at gunpoint to hand over Emmett. They load Emmett onto the flatbed and have Carolyn confirm Emmett's identity. As several men hold Emmett down, they take him away.<br/><br/>In Chicago, Mamie gets a call from Uncle Preacher saying that Emmett is missing. Then, a friend comes in because a reporter called her with the news. Police found Emmett's body in a river, and he is dead. After fighting with Mississippi, Mamie meets Emmett's body at the same train station she waved goodbye to him. She falls apart.<br/><br/>Mamie and Gene meet the mortician, and Mamie demands to see Emmett's remains. The mortician suggests making Emmett look better, but Mamie tells the mortician that Emmett is perfect. She goes outside to the awaiting media and makes a call to action. Mamie decides to have a public viewing of Emmett, so everyone will know what happened and light a fire under Mississippi to charge the men responsible. This act is the first step of Mamie becoming a civil rights activist and sharing a mother's pain for future generations.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just about Emmett's injustice. It's about the pain, scrutiny, and humiliation Mamie suffered while bravely sitting and testifying during Emmett's murder trial. The director made a bold choice not to show Emmett's murder. However, viewers get a full devastating view of the aftermath. Everything, from hair to clothes to eyewear, was spot on for the period and backed up by photographs. Listen carefully to the news reports in the background. They report about the lynching of Reverand George Washington Lee and his verdict. While Emmett is in Mississippi, you see that Mamie has a nagging feeling that clinches around her. That feeling only a parent knows. This movie will move you to tears and shock you as Mamie gets assistance from T. R. M. Howard, Medgar Evers, and Myrlie Evers and ushers in the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Amsterdam",
    "review":"During World War I, Officer Harold Woodsman refuses to work with his squad leader because Harold believes he is a Jim Crow doctor that won't save him or his fellow soldiers. Their commander puts Dr. Burt Berendsen in charge of the battalion. They both get hit by shrapnel during a firefight in France, and Nurse Valerie works on them. Burt lost an eye in the firefight, so Valerie takes him to the best glass eye makers in town, Paul Canterbury and Henry Norcross. Harold and Burt can see that Paul and Henry are spies. They offer to help Paul and Henry in their missions. For a while, the three make a great team in Amsterdam. However, Burt wants to return to New York to be with Beatrice. Valerie and Harold follow, but Valerie leaves Harold with a Dear John letter days after they arrive.<br/><br/>Harold is a lawyer by 1933, and Burt is a veteran's doctor. Burt takes the cases that no one wants because the soldiers need less than reputable medication. Harold enters Burt's office and asks him to perform a back alley surgery for their captain, Senator Bill Meekins. Bill's daughter, Elizabeth, begs Burt to take the case. Elizabeth thinks someone poisoned Bill and wants Burt to perform an autopsy with Harold's forged paperwork. Elizabeth was right. When Harold and Burt try to tell her, Elizabeth runs away. Voze told Elizabeth that looking into Bill's death could get her killed. They try to get more information, but a hitman shoves Elizabeth onto the street, and a car runs her over, killing her. They go to the Voze's home and find Valerie. She is a Voze and is suffering from a nerve disorder. The three band together to find Bill and Elizabeth's killer. However, they will find a plan to bring down America.<br/><br/>Excellent movie with amazing actors. However, it is too long. You can cut an hour out of this film and get an understanding of the plot. Designers expertly select costumes, medical equipment, slang, and scenery for the age period. Viewers will leave this movie connecting the evildoer's goal and politics today. It's all about power and control, no matter who is at the top.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
