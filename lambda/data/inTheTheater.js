    "mtitle":"Four Good Days",
    "review":"Deb wakes up to the sound of frantic knocking on her door. It's her youngest daughter, Molly.  Molly became an opioid addict at 16-years-old after an injury.  Molly begs Deb for a place to stay because she wants to detox, but Deb says no. Deb is exhausted at the state and sight of Molly, but Deb doesn't cave.  She tells Molly to stay away until she is clean and shuts the door.  Throughout the night, Deb checks her front steps and sees Molly sleeping.  In the morning, Deb offers to drive Molly to Clear Horizons Detox center for help. With Medicaid, Molly can detox for three days, and then she can leave.  After three days, Deb goes to the detox center to pick up Molly, and the doctor pulls them into a room.  Since heroin has a 97% relapse rate and this detox is Molly's 15th try, the doctor believes she would be a prime candidate for opioid agonist therapy. But the patient must be drug-free for a week to start and continue the therapy.  When Molly learns she has to stay clean for four more days, she has a meltdown. When the past, lies, and neglect boil to the surface, can Molly and Deb survive four days clean and with each other?<br/><br/>Based on 'How's Amanda? A story of Truth, Lies, and an American Addiction,' this movie will provoke all the feelings you have when watching Intervention.  Deb scrutinizes everything Molly says and does through the filter of an addict.  While this movie shows Molly in the depths of her addiction, it displays the impact it has on the people around her and Deb. This movie holds nothing back about addiction and the ripple effect of pain it causes.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Mortal Kombat",
    "review":"In the 17th century, the Outworld wants to end the Mortal Kombat competition before it begins. By killing Hanzo's bloodline, they can ensure defeat in Mortal Kombat and take over the Earthrealm.  With Hanzo, his son, and his wife dead, Bi-Han leaves with a feeling of accomplishment.  However, before the face-off between Hanzo and Bi-Han, Bi-Han's wife hid their daughter.  Knowing Hanzo is dead, Raiden comes to Earth and rescues Hanzo's daughter.  Today, Cole battles in an MMA cage match. After losing, yet again, Jax approaches Cole and asks him about his dragon logo.  Cole's daughter tells Jax the logo is his birthmark. Cole and his family eat at a diner, and it starts to snow, but Cole points out that it's July.  Then they see Sub-Zero freezing the world around them.  Jax pulls up in his car and yells at them to get in.  Jax tells Cole that his birthmark is a champion's mark, and Jax has the same marking. So, Jax gets out of the car, gives Cole a name and address, and allows Cole to leave with this family while he fights Sub-Zero. Sonya invites Cole inside her bunker and explains that the Earth is in danger.  In the last 9 Mortal Kombats, the Outworld reign supreme.  If they win again, the Earth and everyone on it will become a slave to the Outworld.  This battle to the death will force Cole to face his past, gifts, and destiny.<br/><br/>Based on the popular game Mortal Kombat, this movie offers lots of graphics and battles to feast your eyes upon.  However, the writers' breeze through the history of Mortal Kombat so quickly, you could miss it if you cough. The script tells these impactful points in less than 15 seconds.  This movie makes up for its flaws with an eye-catching final fighting scene with a nod to the game.  The final image left the possibility for a part two, but viewers shouldn't keep their fingers crossed for that.  And don't stay after the end credits.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Together Together",
    "review":"Matt and Anna sit across from each other as he asks her probing questions.  Matt decided to become a father using his sperm and a donor egg. However, he must interview candidates to carry his child. At first, he shows concern because Anna had a child but gave it up for adoption. But Matt pushes his reservations aside and chooses Anna.  With no support from her estranged family, Anna becomes a surrogate on their third try. Through the three trimesters, the love in their arrangement helps them form a bond and grow individually.<br/><br/>Consider this to be a romantic comedy without lovers.  It's easy to see how the plot could make them lovers, but the writer lets you know this is an arrangement that develops into a friendship. And be prepared to laugh at the awkwardness of their lives in everyday situations like a baby shower, birthing class, and group therapy.  This movie is a combination of Seinfeld and Juno.  If that's your type of humor, this is one to see but not buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Earth is heating up, and humans must find another hospitable planet.  They find a suitable second Earth, but it will take 83 years to travel there.  Richard suggests that scientists breed a crew from other scientists, raise them indoors and in isolation, and train them to sustain the ship.  The crew's grandchildren will be the ones who reach the new Earth. Richard launches into space with a crew of kids whose grandchildren will make it to the new Earth.  For ten years, everything goes well until the computer tests positive for toxic chemicals in the plant water.  Since the plant water is filtered urine, Christopher wonders what's wrong with them.  As the crew sleeps, Christopher and Zac search the database for the unknown compound in their urine causing the positive reading.  They learn the compound blocks their desires and makes them dull and docile. They determine the chemical compound is in their daily-required drink that they call \"The Blue.\"  Zac and Christopher decide to stop drinking it, and they feel everything for the first time, including anger, jealousy, and lust. When Zac sees Richard touching Sela's shoulder, he is furious. The next day, Richard and Zac prepare to go outside to repair the spacecraft, but recent unacceptable behavior makes Richard choose Christopher to help him.  During the repair, a shadowy figure moves past Richard, and he screams in pain.  Christopher pulls Richard inside, and the medical team tries to help him, but it's too late. As the new captain, Christopher's act is to find out what happened to Richard.  Zac thinks it's an alien, but Christopher isn't so sure.  On the hunt for the truth, the crew will divide into two factions: the believers and the non-believers.  After blood and accusations, only one will come out on top.<br/><br/>This futuristic rendition of Lord of the Flies takes some time to get interesting, but it does after the crew breaks down.  As the movie progresses, it changes from an alien plotline to a whodunit.  With well-crafted sets and costumes, you will dive into the plot.  But parents, if you are watching with your teens, be prepared to be uncomfortable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

She drinks her woes away when her son, Malcolm, walks into the room to find her drunk. He got engaged to Susan, and they want to live together. But Frances tells Malcolm her news first, and, much to Susan's chagrin, Malcolm halts from telling the truth about his engagement.  When Malcolm tries to tell Frances again, she cuts him off with more news: a friend offered to let Frances and Malcolm stay in her apartment in France.  Malcolm keeps quiet. Frances, Malcolm, their cat, and thousands of dollars get on a cruise headed to France.  Before Frances' \"French Exit,\" she will allow a private investigator, a clairvoyant, a new friend, an old flame, and a fiancé to stay in this cozy apartment.  She will connect to her husband and reveal a horrific end for her vacation.<br/><br/>Based on French Exit by Patrick deWitt, this dark comedy provides unusual laughs at uncomfortable situations.  You will dream of having Frances' bravado in everyday life.  While this movie is entertaining, you won't have an urge to buy it.  But if you don't like dark comedies or rich people's problems, this isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
