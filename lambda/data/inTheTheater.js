    "review":"Dani's father wakes her up because a tornado is attacking their reservation.  He tells Dani to hide in the woods and stay there until he comes back.  Moments later, his dead body flies past her, and she runs.  Only to stumble, fall, and hit her head.  She wakes up handcuffed to a hospital bed and locked in a room.  She screams for help, then Dr. Reyes appears. Dr. Reyes tells Dani her entire reservation died, but she survived because she's a mutant. The doctor explains that during Dani's hospital stay, she will discover and learn to control her powers.  When she is not a threat to society or herself, Dani will leave the hospital and met the higher-ups.  During a group session, Dani meets the other mutants.  Each teenage mutant hides a dark secret about their past and wants out of the hospital.  Dani believes if she follows the regimen, she will be released.  And all the mutants hope they will leave the hospital and become X-Men.  But during a session, Dani sees Dr. Reyes's secrets.  She and the other mutants are in danger.  They have to find a way out of the hospital, past Dr. Reyes and her force field, and past their most dangerous enemy: their fears.<br/><br/>The direction of this superhero movie starts as a horror movie.  It is engaging and riveting for the viewer. It allows you to wonder about what Dani can do and how it affects others.  The CGI is better than most, and the cast plays the mutants dynamically. However, The New Mutants ends like a Disney movie. For all the intense drama and character development throughout the storyline, the ending is very disappointing. This movie has such promise and leaves you with nothing.  By the way, there is no post-credit scene.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cut Throat City",
    "review":"After Hurricane Katrina, James hasn't been able to find a job as an artist.  He has an associates degree from Tulane and created a graphic novel called Cut Throat City. After FEMA turns down his aid request, James and his three friends - Junior, Miracle, and Dre, visit James's Cousin Bass. Bass gives them a job.  They have to rob a local casino and give Bass the cash and chips from the robbery. During the robbery, Miracle, the lookout and driver, sees several uniformed officers about to enter the casino.  Miracle starts shooting. After a high-speed shootout, Dre was hit and died. The next morning they see Bass.  Bass expects a lot of money because the newspaper says the robbers took $150,000.  However, James reports they only stole $25,000, but they spent some. Even if the paper lied, Bass suspects the men got $100,000, so Bass wants $80,000.  James promises to get the money with interest, but that's not good enough for Bass.  James calls his wife and tells her to leave town with their son, then goes into hiding.  On the other side of New Orleans, Detective Lucinda gets a call from the Councilman.  No police officers reported being in a shoot out.  The cops were fake, so someone set up James and his friends.  Until they know, James, Junior, and Miracle know they can't come back to the 9th ward without Bass's money.  They only know one way to get back home: rob casinos and take the money to the Saint for safe passage.<br/><br/>Cut Throat City starts like a lot of heist movies; the main character is down on their luck and decides to do one crime to make things right. As the plot becomes more complicated, it starts to lose focus.  Instead of a heist movie, it becomes a movie about government and police corruption.  In the end, the conclusion gives an alternate ending, but you don't know where the fake ending started in the story.  So, you will have more questions than answers.  Hopefully, the DVD extras will explain it all.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rachel got some bad news; her soon-to-be-ex-husband wants the house.  Exhausted from a late-night, Rachel tells her lawyer, Andy, she will handle it later because she is running late to take her son, Kyle, to school and go to work.  During the drive, Rachel gets a call from her client.  When the client hears Rachel will be late again, the client fires Rachel over the phone. She decides to get off the freeway and take Kyle to school using the backstreets.  At the light, she sits behind a pickup truck, but the driver doesn't move during the green light.  Rachel lays on the horn, then drives around.  At the next light, the pickup truck driver asks Kyle to roll down his window.  He asks if Rachel knows what a courtesy honk is and why she didn't use it.  Frustrated, she tells the man he was in the wrong.  The man apologizes for being upset and ignoring the light.  In turn, the man wants Rachel to apologize too.  She refuses to apologize.  The man vows to make her see what a bad day is.  Then, he starts to follow her down the street, leaving accidents and injuries in his wake. Rachel gets gas and sees the man behind her car.  She alerts the gas station clerk and a good Samaritan. The man hits the Samaritan and stalks Rachel on the road. Rachel doesn't know the man killed his ex-wife and her new husband just hours prior.  He is a monster with pure road rage, and Rachel is in his crosshairs.<br/><br/>Unhinged is a thriller, suspense, and horror movie all rolled into one.  You must be in your seat during the opening credits to see news clips of people losing it on the road.  By witnessing the unhinged man kill in the beginning, it helps you understand that Rachel isn't the driving force behind his actions.  She is just the next victim of his rage. This hard-hitting movie will make you jump in your seat, shock you, and leave you with a lasting impact.  See it in theaters today.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ray wakes up with no memory of his past and Dr. Emil by his bedside.  His body was donated by the military to Rising Spirit Technologies, or R.S.T., because his family didn’t claim his body.  Ray is R.S.T’s first fully revived candidate.  Ray feels normal but Dr. Emil cuts his hand and puts it under a microscope.  Ray can see nanites repairing his cut before it has a chance to bleed.  Now, Ray is superhuman.  KT sees Ray is having a hard time adjusting so she offers to help Ray remember which alcohol he likes.  As they take shots, Psycho Killer is played over the speaker.  It jogs an agonizing memory.  Before Ray died, Martin Axe drugged him and kidnapped his wife, Gina.  Martin wanted to know how Ray knew about the hostage situation in Mombasa.  Ray explains that he was following orders and never knew who leaked the information.  Martin believes Ray but kills Gina with a bolt gun anyway.  Ray tells Martin that Martin better kill him or Ray will end his life.  Martin takes Ray on his suggestion and kills Ray.  Ray doesn’t know the killer was planted in his head.  Dr. Emil is using Ray to eliminate former RST employees that are a threat to his business.  When Ray discovers the truth, he will need to gain control of his new augmented body and bring down his creator.<br/><br/>Based on the Bloodshot comics, this movie doesn’t hold a candle to the comic.  The plot is a mix of Deadpool and Frankenstein but it still doesn’t excite you.  The graphics are cartoonish, the action mundane, and the plot overdone.  Thank goodness for the comic relief Wilfred.  This lovable computer genius is the wingman or ‘guy in the chair’ every superhero needs.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"With a brand new guitar, Jeremy Camp leaves home for Calvary Chapel Bible College.  After some time on campus, he sneaks backstage to hear and get tips from musician Jean-Luc.  Not only did Jean-Luc give Jeremy tips, but he also let Jeremy tune his guitar.  As Jeremy switches out the guitar, he sees a beautiful girl in the crowd.  After the concert, he introduces himself to Melissa.  The next day, she sees him play guitar under a tree.  She invites him to a bonfire and tells him to bring his guitar.  At the bonfire, Jeremy is surprised to see Jean-Luc there with Melissa.  She explains her relationship with Jean-Luc is complicated.  Jean-Luc wants more from their friendship but she doesn't.  Unknown to Jean-Luc, Jeremy and Melissa start to date.  The couple breaks up after a few months because Jeremy is tired of being a secret.  During winter break, Jeremy gets a phone call from Jean-Luc.  Melissa was taken to the hospital and it’s bad.  Melissa tells Jeremy she has stage C3 cancer.  They removed a cancerous growth, the size of an orange, from her stomach and she will start chemotherapy soon.  To keep the love of his life, Jeremy asks Melissa to marry him.   He is inspired to write songs for and ask fans to pray for his wife.  With those decisions, Jeremy will find the miracle before the supernova.<br/><br/>Based on I Still Believe by Jeremy Camp, this movie is a moving tribute to Melissa and the legacy she wanted to leave behind.  She wanted Jeremy to use her story to make people believe in faith and hope, not lose it during hard times.  It may not have the same outcome as Breakthrough, it does give you a powerful love story within a deeper love story.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
