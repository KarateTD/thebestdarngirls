  "review":"Ten years ago, Dominic Toretto and his team stole a vault from Hernan Reyes. Dominic thought his problems ended after Agent Luke Hobbs shot Reyes on the bridge after a destructive highway chase. However, Dominic didn't see Reyes's son, Dante, driving the car with the machine gun on the top. Dante's body flew into the river, and he survived. Dante vowed to kill Dominic, but Hernan told Dante to make Dominic suffer before he died.<br/><br/>Now, Dominic enjoys the simple life with his wife, Letty, and teaches his son, Little Brian, how to drive and fix cars. The Agency sent a new mission, and Roman took the lead. He asked Tej and Ramsey to accompany him to Rome. Dominic asks Han to go with them, just in case. Then, they get a bloody knock at the door. It's Cipher with bruises, cuts, and stab wounds. Cipher tells him that Dante took over her crew, got her technology, and left her for dead. Now, Dominic is next on Dante's list.<br/><br/>Little Nobody arrests Cipher after Dominic questions her. They catch up, and Dominic asks Little Nobody how Roman's mission is going. Little Nobody can't hide his confusion because the Agency didn't set it up. Dominic knows the mission was a ruse created by Dante. Dominic and Letty leave Brian with Mia and head to Rome. After a Raiders-of-the-Lost-Arc-styled bomb rolls through Rome, the Agency list Dominic and his crew, now separated, at the top of the most wanted list. Dominic has to protect his family with Dante and the Agency after him. Can Dominic save everyone?<br/><br/>The writers of Fast and the Furious understand what the critics think and make fun of themselves. Agent Aimes states that Dominic and his crew violate the laws of physics and God but somehow survive. Of course, you get mind-bending situations, crazy car stunts, and an international plot. But, there is one blaring difference with this movie: Dante. He is a flamboyant, funny, and charismatic psychopath. Dominic takes any moment to make the audience chuckle or gasp in awe. Sadly, the backing tracks and sound effects muffle a few of his quips. Unlike other Fast and The Furious movies, it doesn't end on a family barbeque. It concludes with the ultimate cliffhanger for Dominic and his family. Don't forget to stay for the mid-credit scene that gives viewers a glimpse into another spinoff.<br/><br/>4 out of stars.",

    "review":"Danny Rourke finishes his counseling session and meets his partner, Nicks, for their shift. Detective Nicks tells Danny that they got an anonymous call about a bank robbery that will happen today. And the robber will take box number 23. Danny gets in the surveillance van, and a man sitting on a bench catches Danny's eye. The man, Dellrayne, gets up, talks to the guards, and enters the bank. Danny believes Dellrayne is the mastermind and the guards are part of the plan. As a commotion rumbles outside, Danny follows Dellrayne inside the bank. Danny pretends to want a safety deposit box, distracts the bank employee, and opens box 23. He finds a polaroid of his daughter, Minnie, with the words 'Find Lev Dellrayne' written at the bottom. He panics because Lyle kidnapped Minnie 4 years ago. Although the courts convicted Lyle, they never recovered Minnie.<br/><br/>Dellrayne gets the box, and Danny chases Dellrayne to a roof. Dellrayne opens the box to discover it's empty. Danny pulls the picture out of his pocket and demands to know Minnie's location. Dellrayne tells Danny's backup they have the wrong guy, and they turn their weapons at Danny. Dellrayne escapes by jumping off the roof.<br/><br/>Danny returns to the van with Detective Nicks, and Detective Nicks tells Danny that the techs traced the call to a dime-store psychic, Diane. Danny interviews Diane about Dellrayne, and she is fearful. Diane says Dellrayne is a powerful man who wants to kill her.<br/><br/>Danny takes Diane to police storage to keep Diane safe. Diane explains that she and Dellrayne are Hypnotics. Hypnotics can alter someone's mind through a psychic bandwidth and make people do or think anything they desire. A government organization called Division wanted to turn Hypnotics into weapons. However, Dellrayne became too powerful. So Division created a tool, Domino, to stop him. Dellrayne stole Domino when he escaped, hid it, and wiped his memory. Dellrayne left clues behind to find Domino and reclaim his memory. Diane believes that Minnie is the key to finding Domino. Danny tells Diane that he believes Minnie is dead. So they decide to find Domino instead. Danny can't trust anything he sees or hears in a world of hypnotics.<br/><br/>This movie quickly picks up the pace. The effects aren't mind-blowing, but they are effective. These altered moments are evident when the director removes them and exposes the bare bones behind the movie's magic. During the recap, they playback with the beginning with and without Hypnotic power, and it will leave you speechless. Also, one mid-credit scene leaves this movie open for part two. This film is fun, but you won't be in a rush to buy it later. However, it's worth the theater if you are into mind-bending thrillers.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mira kisses her boyfriend, John, goodbye and watches him walk across the street while waving to her. Then, a car hits and kills him in front of her eyes. Two years later, Mira's writing career is at a standstill, and her publisher threatens to sue her for her advance. Mira's sister, Suzy, convinces Mira to move out of their parent's home and with her. Later, Suzy moves in boxes from the automobile and finds one labeled John. They find a recording of Orpheus and Eurydice, a record player, and an engagement ring. Mira sobs because John never got a chance to ask her. And she puts on the engagement ring. That night, she prepares two glasses of wine and attempts a conversation with John. However, talking to air feels silly, and Mira turns to their favorite form of communication: texting.<br/><br/>Rob works at the New York Chronicle and wants to focus on his podcast. However, his boss, Richard, tells Rob to document the resurgence of Celine Dion. Rob sighs and listens to her music for preparation. Rob's co-worker, Lisa, gives Rob a company phone. Rob doesn't understand why he needs one, but Lisa and Billy urge him to take it. Rob goes home and watches a basketball game. Then, his work phone sends him a text notification from an unknown number. He reads these messages with expressions of deep longing. He wants to know more but doesn't respond. Rob has a one-on-one meeting with Celine, and she encourages her to go after the mystery woman and find love. Rob uses Mira's text to learn she will be at the opera. He waits for her and engineers a meet-cute. He decides not to tell Mira about the text, but will her heart go on when she discovers the truth (sorry for the pun)?<br/><br/>Based on the novel SMS für dich by Sofie Cramer, and an English remake of SMS für dich, this movie has the setup of a Hallmark original without the return to the small hometown. It doesn't hold back from the pain and devastation death can cause. Also, Rob became disillusioned by love when his fiancée left him one week before their wedding. Viewers know it is a matter of time before Mira discovers the truth, but you wait for the 'how.' This plot has the classic rom-com setup and ending but has a lot of heart, music, and pain. This film won't make your Vudu queue, but it's worth the matinee.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Big George Foreman: The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World",
    "review":"Nancy moved her children to Houston, Texas's fifth ward housing community. She splits a sandwich between her four children and tells her son, George Foreman, not to fight in school. When a kid picks on George for being poor, George stands up and punches the kid in the face. That anger and resentment followed George into his teens. George walks down the street and sees a TV commercial for the Job Corps. He begs Nancy to let him join.<br/><br/>George keeps his anger in check and makes a friend, Desmond, but things change when someone steals George's Chuck Taylor sneakers. George spots a cadet wearing them and chases the person on campus. George breaks down a door, hangs the man upside down from a window, and takes the shoes off the man's feet. Doc sees George's handy work and tells George that he must leave school. George begs to stay. So Doc offers George a choice: Train to become a boxer or leave school. George agrees, gets in the ring, and learns that punching isn't enough. After training for a year, George wants fancy cars and a large home. Doc doesn't think George will be ready for the 1968 Olympics in one year and wants George to wait five years. George sets out to prove Doc and the rest of the world wrong for the next 50 years.<br/><br/>This movie is three comeback stories in one. The costume department did a tremendous job using archival photos to recreate George's look. This attention to detail cemented the era. Also, Khris brings the nuances of the heavyweight champion to life through his physical appearance and iconic voice. While fans of the champ won't learn anything new, this movie is worth a big-screen viewing based on the performances alone.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
