    "review":"Sol and Jennifer cross paths but never see each other until she walks into a sports bar with friends on their way to dinner.  David approaches Jennifer and her friends with two of his friends.  Before David can start his crushed pinky toe story, Sol walks away to get more drinks, and Jennifer isn't far behind. Sol invites Jennifer to go running the next morning. They end their run, and Sol takes her to the local merchants' market. Jennifer discovers Sol, a digital marketer, has a passion for cooking.  She asks Sol to cook for her now.  Or never.  As time goes by, Jennifer can see Sol's not happy at his job, but he wants financial stability.  So she asks Sol to move in and lighten his financial load.  Even though they are living together, Sol worries he can never be a chef because he didn't go to culinary school.  Jennifer has a bright idea.  She invites their friends over for Thanksgiving dinner.  By the end of the night, Sol puts in his 2-week notice.  Now, Sol is a chef at Gigi's, Jennifer's cousin's, restaurant and is in love. So much so, he proposes to Jennifer, and she says yes.  She can't wait to spend the rest of her life with Sol, but that time could be cut short.  Sol's stomach pains have worsened, and a biopsy revealed cancer.  When Sol falls apart, can Jennifer keep him together?<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, it doesn't take much to see where this film goes.  Reminiscent of 2 Hearts, this movie isn't a tear-jerker but a warning to live and do better. In a state of self-sacrifice, he wants to give Jennifer an out.  But she refuses.  Her love for him goes before and beyond wedding vows. You know the pain of impending doom is there. This is a love story that accomplished more in a short time than many do in a lifetime.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 1994, Renato and his father, Flavio, loved to spend time together being mischievous. They played with remote-controlled airplanes, annoyed the townspeople, and solved riddles.  Then, the Mexican market crashed, and the work dried up.  Flavio left his wife, Tere, and Renato to make money in America and send it back to them.  Renato watched Flavio walk away and never saw him again.  Today, Renato is a highly respected engineer that runs a thriving aeronautics company. He gets a call from Katherine, and she tells Renato that she and Flavio are married, Flavio is sick, and they are living in Chicago.  Katherine asks Renato to visit Flavio before he dies.  Renato has no plans to visit his father because he is getting married in 5 days and he doesn't want to see him.  Pam, Renato's fiancé, tells him to see his father and make peace because it may help him connect with his future stepson, Emilio.  With Pam's encouragement, Renato flies to Chicago to see Flavio. Flavio is overjoyed to see his son again, but Renato feels only pain.  Then another man walks into the room. As recognition sets in, Renato can't believe what he heard, the man called Flavio 'dad.'  Flavio introduces Asher to Renato.  Flavio wants to explain what happened to him to Renato and Asher, so Flavio created a scavenger hunt to tell his story.  Flavio tells his sons 'Eloise' has all the answers and hands them an envelope with the name Evaristo on it and a key inside. In the middle of the night, Katherine calls.  Flavio died. Pam convinces Renato to go on the scavenger hunt to get the answers Flavio couldn't give, but he needs to be home in time for their wedding.  What's the worst that can happen?<br/><br/>This not-yet-buddies comedy packs a lot of emotion in less than 2 hours.  When Renato sees Asher, he sees everything he hates about American and his father. Asher, on the other hand, wishes he could be Renato because Asher always felt weird and out of place. Both men want the father the other had.  And Flavio's clues lead his sons on a journey to learn what happened to him and why he stayed in America.  He never excuses his actions.  Flavio only explains and asks for forgiveness.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Croods: A New Age",
    "review":"Guy, much to Grug's chagrin, joined the Croods as they search for Guy's Tomorrow. Grug worries Guy will pull Eep away from the pack, but Ugga tells him that's the natural order. Guy and Eep confirm Grug's fears after he overhears them in the sleep-pile.  Grug gives Eep a rock with their picture and asks her to join him, and start a new pack.  Eep says yes, and Grug leaves the sleep-pile and finds something new.  He wakes up the family and brings them to a high fence.  They knock a hole in the barrier and see rows of fresh food and beautiful flowers.  Before the family gorges, Grug welcomes them to Tomorrow, and now, the pack can stay together, forever.  Then Grug sees something he hasn't seen in a long time, a sweet fruit he called a banana.  Just as he grabs it, it sets off a trap, and a net pulls the entire Crood family up a tree.  Two figures emerge and poke the family with sticks but see similarities. Then, introduce themselves as Phil and Hope Betterman.  After further inspection, they see Guy and hug him.  Before Guy's parents died, the Bettermans were friends with his family, but after the tar killed them, the Bettermans lost track of Guy.  They bring the Croods to their treehouse and introduce the Croods to their daughter, Dawn.  As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"It's Wednesday the 11th, and four teens sit on a patio and compare tales about the Blissfield Butcher. Within minutes, only one teen is alive, and she is running for her life.  The girl's father collects antiques, and one is the La Dola knife.  After the butcher kills his last victim, the knife speaks to him, and he takes it.  Thursday the 12th, Millie tries to sit and eat with her mother, Coral, and her sister, Officer Char. School should be a solace for Millie but it's not.  She does have her two best friends, Nyla and Josh, but other students and her shop teacher belittle her every day.  Millie gets a mass text about the four murdered students but prepares for the homecoming game. After the homecoming game, Millie tells Josh and Nyla that Coral is late and should be coming soon.  After waiting an hour, Millie calls her mom, and Char picks up the phone.  Their mom is passed out drunk.  Before Char finishes speaking, Millie's phone dies.  Millie looks up and sees a man in a mask with a knife.  The butcher catches up to her and stabs her with the La Dola knife in the shoulder, but he gets a wound in the same place.  Then, Char fires her gun in the air and the butcher runs away.  Millie is safe and suffers a minor stab wound.  Friday the 13th, Millie wakes up on a dirty mattress on the floor with horror all around her. Then, she realizes she is in the butcher's body.  Millie makes her way to the school and convinces Josh and Nyla of her true identity. The knife is a ceremonial sacrificial knife.  If a sacrifice isn't made, they will swap bodies.  After the swap, they have 24 hours to swap back or it will be permanent.  They realize they have 8 hours left to find the butcher, get the knife, and stab him before Millie is the butcher forever.<br/><br/>Remember the good old days, when you walked into a movie and expected nothing. Just to have a good time, a few laughs, and some decent jump scares.  Well, this is your movie. This mix of Freaky Friday and Chucky provides the good nature, albeit gruesome releases needed.  For those afraid of horror movies, the film provides you with victims who deserve to die.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
