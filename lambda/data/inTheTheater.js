    "mtitle":"The Croods: A New Age",
    "review":"Guy, much to Grug's chagrin, joined the Croods as they search for Guy's Tomorrow. Grug worries Guy will pull Eep away from the pack, but Ugga tells him that's the natural order. Guy and Eep confirm Grug's fears after he overhears them in the sleep-pile.  Grug gives Eep a rock with their picture and asks her to join him, and start a new pack.  Eep says yes, and Grug leaves the sleep-pile and finds something new.  He wakes up the family and brings them to a high fence.  They knock a hole in the barrier and see rows of fresh food and beautiful flowers.  Before the family gorges, Grug welcomes them to Tomorrow, and now, the pack can stay together, forever.  Then Grug sees something he hasn't seen in a long time, a sweet fruit he called a banana.  Just as he grabs it, it sets off a trap, and a net pulls the entire Crood family up a tree.  Two figures emerge and poke the family with sticks but see similarities. Then, introduce themselves as Phil and Hope Betterman.  After further inspection, they see Guy and hug him.  Before Guy's parents died, the Bettermans were friends with his family, but after the tar killed them, the Bettermans lost track of Guy.  They bring the Croods to their treehouse and introduce the Croods to their daughter, Dawn.  As Grug sees the family settling into the Betterman lifestyle, he fears losing his entire pack to the Betterman way.  And Grug is correct to worry.  The Bettermans believe Guy should be with them, not the Croods. Soon, Ugga and Grug unlock their plan, and it will cause a chain reaction of bad decisions, all starting with bananas.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Croods, this movie expands their world, your imagination, and the artistry of computer animation.  Parents don't come to this movie expecting to get a nap because you will be laughing from beginning to end.  And don't come late because the first 5 minutes show the audience what happened to Guy's parents, and it shows the first time he met Eep from his perspective.  As the Croods and Bettermans come across punch monkeys, bee stings, spider wolves, and the Thundersisters, they learn to stop judging one another and work together.  The lessons that shine clear in this film is differences should be celebrated and growth is good.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Freaky",
    "review":"It's Wednesday the 11th, and four teens sit on a patio and compare tales about the Blissfield Butcher. Within minutes, only one teen is alive, and she is running for her life.  The girl's father collects antiques, and one is the La Dola knife.  After the butcher kills his last victim, the knife speaks to him, and he takes it.  Thursday the 12th, Millie tries to sit and eat with her mother, Coral, and her sister, Officer Char. School should be a solace for Millie but it's not.  She does have her two best friends, Nyla and Josh, but other students and her shop teacher belittle her every day.  Millie gets a mass text about the four murdered students but prepares for the homecoming game. After the homecoming game, Millie tells Josh and Nyla that Coral is late and should be coming soon.  After waiting an hour, Millie calls her mom, and Char picks up the phone.  Their mom is passed out drunk.  Before Char finishes speaking, Millie's phone dies.  Millie looks up and sees a man in a mask with a knife.  The butcher catches up to her and stabs her with the La Dola knife in the shoulder, but he gets a wound in the same place.  Then, Char fires her gun in the air and the butcher runs away.  Millie is safe and suffers a minor stab wound.  Friday the 13th, Millie wakes up on a dirty mattress on the floor with horror all around her. Then, she realizes she is in the butcher's body.  Millie makes her way to the school and convinces Josh and Nyla of her true identity. The knife is a ceremonial sacrificial knife.  If a sacrifice isn't made, they will swap bodies.  After the swap, they have 24 hours to swap back or it will be permanent.  They realize they have 8 hours left to find the butcher, get the knife, and stab him before Millie is the butcher forever.<br/><br/>Remember the good old days, when you walked into a movie and expected nothing. Just to have a good time, a few laughs, and some decent jump scares.  Well, this is your movie. This mix of Freaky Friday and Chucky provides the good nature, albeit gruesome releases needed.  For those afraid of horror movies, the film provides you with victims who deserve to die.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Let Him Go",
    "review":"George and Margaret work on their Montana ranch with the help of their son, James, and James's wife, Lorna, and their baby, Jimmy.  Margaret looks outside the window and sees James's horse, but no James.  George finds James dead on a pile of rocks next to a creek.  Three years later, George and Margaret attend Lorna and Donnie Weboy's wedding. A few days later, Margaret sits in her car outside the grocery store and sees Donnie, Lorna, and Jimmy walking while eating ice cream cones.  Then, Donnie laughs at Jimmy because he dropped his ice cream.  When Jimmy refuses Donnie, Donnie hits Jimmy.  Lorna comes to Jimmy's defense, and Donnie hits her too.  They leave.  Margaret doesn't tell George what she saw at the grocery store.  Instead, she makes a cake and takes it to Donnie's home, but the family is gone. Margaret comes home and prepares for a trip.  When George gets home, he knows something is wrong. Margaret believes Lorna can't defend herself and their grandson.  So Margaret will get Jimmy back. George closes his suitcase, and they head down the road.  George and Margaret don't know the Weboy Family is powerful in North Dakota.  The matriarch, Blanche, rules with an iron fist, shotgun, and a lit cigarette. She will never let any of the Weboys walk away again, including Jimmy.<br/><br/>Based on Let Him Go by Larry Watson, this movie is a slow burn but picks up at the end.  Just a warning, some scenes can be pretty gruesome.  But what you are witnessing is three mothers fighting for the boy they love. In the end, it all comes down to Jimmy and how much people are willing to sacrifice to keep him. Viewers get a Kill Bill Vol. 2 moment, and it's worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
