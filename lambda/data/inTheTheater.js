    "review":"Mr. Wolf is the mastermind behind a gang of thieves.  Mr. Snake is the safe-cracker of the crew with no fingers.  Ms. Tarantula is the hacker, and everyone calls her Web.  Mr. Shark is a master of disguise.  Mr. Piranha is the craziest member because he is willing to fight no matter how many people stand in his way.  Since the world sees them as bad, they act accordingly by robbing banks, pick-pocketing, and running long cons.  Mr. Wolf watches the news coverage, and Governor Foxington's comments make him angry.  Governor Foxington feels sorry for them because they are playing into a stereotype, and she knows the police will catch them soon.  Mr. Wolf wants revenge and decides to loot the Good Samaritan Award, The Golden Dolphin.  The legendary Crimson Paw came close to stealing it but went into hiding afterward.  Mr. Wolf convinces Mr. Snake to take the job by showing him the recipient: Professor Marmalade, a guinea pig.  Mr. Snake can't resist because guinea pigs are his favorite food.<br/><br/>After a wild, well-executed, stinky heist, the team is ready to walk away scot-free.  Then, Mr. Wolf sees an old lady going down the stairs with an open purse full of money and jewels.  He tries to take it, but she starts to fall down the stairs.  He decides to pull her back and help her.  She pats Mr. Wolf on the hand and calls him a good boy.  It has an instant effect on him.  After exposure, Chief Misty arrests the bad guys and throws them in the police van.  Prof. Marmalade speaks on behalf of The Bad Guys.  He offers to reform them at his private residence instead of jail time.  Mr. Wolf agrees on behalf of the entire crew.<br/><br/>Inside the police van, Mr. Wolf's agreement confuses the crew.  They want to know why Mr. Wolf agreed to go 'good.'  Mr. Wolf explains that the award will be at Prof. Marmalade's home.  If they get inside, they will have a second chance to take it.  The Bad Guys will become The Good Guys to be The Bad Guys.<br/><br/>Based on The Bad Guys by Aaron Blabey, this animated Leverage with Lucky Logan comedy style will have adults and kids laughing.  The basis of the heist is realistic, but for children, the animation adds a lot of fun and creative dramatics.  Without it, you can remove the cartoon, add real people, and the script would work.  Adults may want to watch it twice with all the added plot twists.  Yes, there are several within the con.  This movie teaches kids to be more than a stereotype.  That's a lesson everyone can learn.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Father Stu",
    "review":"Stuart Long is an amateur boxer looking for his big break, but he is in the hospital again.  The doctor tells Stu to quit boxing.  Wallowing in self-pity, Stu goes to his brother's grave and drinks.  The cops pull him over and arrest him.  When his mother, Kathleen, bails Stu out of jail, he has a new goal: go to Hollywood and become an actor.<br/><br/>Stu arrives in Hollywood with dreams of becoming famous.  He works in a butcher's shop at the back of a convenience store until then.  At work, Stu sees a beautiful woman, Carmen, and tries to ask her out.  She turns him down and walks out of the store.  A co-worker tells Stu that Carmen posted a flyer for a local church.  Stu gets dressed up and goes to church to impress her.<br/><br/>After a tumultuous day with his father, Bill, Stu rides his motorcycle down the street.  A car almost side-swipes him.  While dodging out of the way, Stu runs a red light.  He gets hit by a car, falls into the street, and gets run over by another vehicle.  As he lays there dying, Stu has a vision of Mary.  She tells him he has more in store for his life, and he will inspire others.  After a few surgeries, Stu feels back to his old self.  He calls Carmen on a date. She thinks Stu is going to propose.  Instead, Stu tells her he wants to become a priest.  Stu plans to enter theology school, become a priest, and lead a flock.  As they say, 'If you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans.' Stu will inspire others in a way he could never imagine.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie is about redemption and grace.  Don't expect the wholesome story that viewers get this time of the year.  This film doesn't try to sugarcoat Stu's life or actions.  He, like everyone else, is a flawed man that struggles each day.  The burden of being a living failure weighs heavily on Stu's soul.  But each downfall becomes a triumph and helps him point his flock onto the right path.  See this one, but not with the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Ambulance",
    "review":"Veteran William Sharp sits on the phone arguing with insurance companies.  His wife, Amy, needs experimental surgery to save her life.  William hangs up the phone and tells Amy everything will be ok.  Then, he reminds her to turn on the alarm while he goes on a forklift driver interview.  Unbeknownst to Amy, William drives to Danny's chopshop.<br/><br/>As William attempts to ask for a 231,000 dollar loan, Danny collects his crew and cars for his next heist.  He gives William 5 minutes to decide if he is in or out.  If William joins, he will gain millions.  William gears up and jumps on the truck.  But there is a kink in the plan.  Officer Zack built up the nerve to talk to his bank teller crush, Kim.  Seeing Zack won't let up, Danny lets Zack inside.  Soon, Zack realizes something is going on, and all hell breaks loose.  Danny didn't know he was part of a task force sting operation.  They knew Danny wanted to hit a bank and planned to catch him after the robbery without hostages.  But Zack messed up their plan too.<br/><br/>After a fight in the parking garage, William shoots Zack.  They see EMT Cam and Scott loading Zack onto the ambulance.  William pulls Scott from the driver's seat, and Danny tries to force Cam out of the back.  But she will not leave her patient.  Danny agrees because killing a cop is a life sentence.  Also, Danny can use Cam and Zack as bargaining chips with the police.  With millions in their bag and two hostages, can Danny and William get home with the money?<br/><br/>A remake of Ambulancen, this film gives you a brief introduction to William's turmoil.  Then the action gets going.  The synopsis above is the first 20 minutes of the movie.  The tale of family bonds rivals all other films before it.  With a 60-mph surgery, unholy alliances, and sharpshooters, this film allows the audience to care about Cam, Danny, and William.  Watch this movie on the big screen only.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Evelyn prepares the paperwork for their upcoming audit.  Her focus pulls her attention away from her husband, Waymond, when he tries to hand her divorce papers.  Her daughter, Joy, waits for Evelyn with Joy's girlfriend, Becky.  Evelyn brushes off Joy and concentrates on work.<br/><br/>Evelyn grabs her paperwork and goes to the IRS headquarters with Waymond and her father, Gong Gong.  As they ride the elevator up, Waymond deploys an umbrella to block the camera, grabs two earbuds, and puts them in Evelyn's ears.  He tells Evelyn that he is Waymond from another universe, and he needs her help.  If she wants to see him again, follow the instructions on the paper.<br/><br/>While talking with the IRS inspector, Deirdre, Evelyn looks at the paper.  It gives Evelyn 3 steps that land her in the janitor's closet with the other Waymond.  He tells her that the multiverse exists.  When another Evelyn discovered you could connect to another version of yourself, they used the power to gain skills.  But Jobu Tupaki wants to use this ability to destroy all the universes.

To tap into another universe's skills, they have to stimulate themselves. And it gets wild with fanny packs, awards, and dogs.  This 3-part film slows down towards the end and loses the audience for a while.  Be ready for a visual feast.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Morbius",
    "review":"Michael Morbius created another origami animal as Dr. Nicholas walked into the room with a new patient, Lucien.  Michael calls him Milo, like all the other ones before him.  They live in a hospital for children with unique blood disorders.  They need to have their blood cleaned three times a day.  During an 'oil change,' Milo's machine stops working, and he passes out.  He opens Milo's pump and fixes it with a pen spring.  Dr. Nicholas believes Michael is a genius and wants Michael to apply to a gifted school.  Michael says yes.  Today, Michael won a Nobel Peace Prize for creating artificial blood.  But he turned it down.  While the blood benefitted so many, it failed to cure his ailment.  However, Michael believes he has a new solution: vampire bats.  He tells his colleague, Dr. Martine, that he wants to mix animal DNA with human DNA.  Michael is ready for human trials, but he knows it's illegal.  So Michael goes to Milo for ship funding to conduct his experiments on international waters.  Milo gives Michael anything and everything that he needs.<br/><br/>On the ship, Michael finds the right mixture.  He asks Martine to inject the serum into his spine.  A guard comes into the room and starts to harass Martine.  She verbally condemns the guard but realizes Michael is gone.  She enters the room with the guard and sees Michael on the ceiling.  The guard shoots, but Michael dodges the bullets and attacks.  After killing several men and drinking their blood, Michael finds Martine unconscious.  He covers her up, calls mayday, and jumps off the ship.  FBI agents, Rodriguez and Stroud, haven't seen a case like this since San Francisco.<br/><br/>Back at Horizon, Michael goes to his lab and tests his new abilities.  He can fly, has increased strength, and can use echolocation, but there is a downfall.  Michael desires human blood every 6 hours.  He tried to use artificial blood.  As his body adapts, Michael needs the fake blood more often.  When Milo sees Michael healthy, he thinks Michael has a cure.  Milo begs, but Michael refuses to give it to him because he doesn't want Milo to become a monster.<br/><br/>When Michael awakes, he hears the staff saying an orderly exsanguinated and died.  Michael can't remember if he did it, so he attempts to leave.  Stroud confronts Michael.  Although Michael could run away, he refuses because he believes he hurt the orderly.<br/><br/>In jail, the guard tells Michael his lawyer is there for a visit.  Michael sees Milo walk through the doors and smiles.  Michael explains everything, and Milo believes Michael is innocent.  Milo leaves and promises to come back.  Michael finds a blood bag and Milo's cane after Milo walks out of the cell.  Michael knows that Milo stole his serum, took it, and faked his illness in the cell.  Now, Micheal has to become Morbius, find a fix, and stop Milo before Milo kills more innocent people.<br/><br/>This origin story gives viewers the same feeling as the Eternals.  The plot fully introduces you to a new character in the MCU, but you didn't get much else.  The graphic designers took dramatic risks to help viewers experience Morbius's echolocation and flying powers.  This risk will translate well in future films.  Also, the director used old-school horror movie tactics to depict the murder scenes.  You never see the killing.  Just aggressive hand movements and blood.  Of course, you need to stick around because there are two end credit scenes.  This film is essential for the next phase.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
