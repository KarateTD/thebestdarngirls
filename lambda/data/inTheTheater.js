        "review": "Henry, an assassin, is ready for retirement.  His conscious is starting to bother him and he is making unsure shots.  His last hit is a bioterrorist.  However, his former colleague Jack has some startling news.  The D.I.A. lied about the last hit.  The man was a molecular biologist with no ties to terrorism.  Henry wants answers.  That night a hit squad tries to kill Henry but he escapes with Danny.  He calls Baron to pick them up and take them to South America.  Before Henry can get some answers another hitman comes after him.  Through Henry's scope, he sees something familiar.  He can't pinpoint it because he only saw the hitman for a few seconds.  Henry doesn't know that a special program took note of his abilities and took his blood.  They created a clone of him and raised it.  Now, the leader of the project has sent the clone to kill Henry.  Will Henry have to kill himself to save himself?<br/><br/>Be ready for some of the best graphics ever witnessed in a movie.  With live-action capture, all the emotional nuances in Will Smith's face is properly displayed and aged down.  The subtle changes in his voice make the younger hitman believable.  See this movie in High Frame Rate if you can.  It is 100% worth it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review": "Wednesday and Pugsley Addams never left the Addams Family estate.  Morticia and Gomez want the children to live free without the judgment of townspeople and pitchforks.  When the marsh is drained by Margaux, a reality D.I.Y. star, the fog is lifted and the Addams are exposed.  Below, Margaux has created a town called Assimilation.  She wants everyone to be the same.  If the Addams can't conform, she will push them out.  Good thing the Addams are more than willing to push back.<br/><br/>Parents, no need to worry, this is the Addams family you know and love.  And your children will have plenty of laughs too.  They will laugh at the Three Stooges violence, Addams dancing, and wild hijinks.  Parents will laugh at the subliminal jokes about death, sex, and love.  Bring the family and be ready to snap at the end.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"Arthur, an aspiring stand-up comedian, works as a clown.  After being attacked by kids, losing his job, and getting a gun, Arthur shoots and kills 3 businessmen on the train during an assault.  This is the only time Arthur has felt alive and he doesn't feel bad.  The next morning, the downtrodden of Gotham see the masked clown as their voice.  He has stood up to the elite that looks down on him.  Arthur finally feels heard and seen.  But when his mother's letters lead him to a dark truth, he will cross paths with a young Bruce Wayne and brings a new found madness to Gotham.<br/><br/>Now here is the proverbial question: Did the darkness of Gotham create the Joker or did Joker bring out the darkness in Gotham.  This is not for children and it is not the M.C.U..  It's a D.C. comics movie, the way it's supposed to be.  Dark, complicated, gritty, raw, and unfiltered.  You will enjoy this movie from beginning to end.  Don't stay past the end credits and there is no need for IMAX or 3D.  Dolby is good enough.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She gets the creature to trust her and names him Everest.  Later, her friends Peng and Jin discovers her secret and try to call the police.

Yi decides she must do everything to get Everest back home.  And Peng and Jin are unwittingly along for the ride.<br/><br/>You must see this movie in 3D to truly enjoy the magic of Everest.  With all cartoons, Yi has a sad backstory that drives her compassion.  There are a plethora of jokes for parents and kids alike.  See the matinee in 3D.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

        "review":"Afghan vet, Alicia West is a 3-week rookie at the New Orleans Police Department.  After hearing gunshots, Alicia walks into an abandoned plant to investigate.  She sees 2 men dead on the ground an another begging for his life.  She witnesses NARC Malone shoot the man in cold blood.  Another NARC spots her and shoots her multiple times.  She escapes but they want her body cam.  To cover his tracks, Malone tells the chief Alicia went rogue and shot all 3 men.  When the neighborhood kingpin Darius arrives on the scene, he is heartbroken to see his nephew dead on the ground.  Malone tells him Alicia killed his nephew.  Now, Alicia has dirty, armed cops and heavily armed gang members hunting her down.  She must get the camera back to the station to upload the footage.  She hopes to clear her name with the police, call off Darius' hit, and hold Malone accountable for his actions.  Good thing she has a Mouse on her side.<br/><br/>While this movie addresses profiling and police brutality, it touches on 2 issues that are easy to miss.  First, the lack of technology.  If the footage was wirelessly uploaded to the cloud, this movie would not exist.  Second, good cops holding bad cops accountable.  When Alicia decides to tell the truth, she knew she would be labeled a rat.  She doesn't care.  This movie is a wild ride that doesn't get too preachy by adding some quick wit.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
