    "review": "Talent manager Anna bangs on her daughter's door before school. However, Harper won't open the door. Anna's mother, Tess, calls to offer Harper a ride to school. Anna wants to give Harper a ride and tells Tess to relax. Therapist Tess hangs up, finishes her podcast, and kisses her husband, Ryan, goodbye. Finally, Anna opens the door and finds Harper's note. Harper started her morning with surfing.<br/><br/>In the car, Harper groans about her chemistry partner, Lily. Harper thinks Lily is obnoxious. Tess and Anna advise Harper to keep an open mind before dropping Harper off at school. That treaty is non-existent. Lily and Harper argue during chemistry class, causing a foam explosion. The principal calls Anna and Lily's dad, Chef Eric, into school. They run into each other in the halls and fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged.<br/><br/>Lily and Harper disagree during a school bake sale, triggering a school-wide food fight. The tension in the home is rising between Harper and Lily. Anna tells them that they will attend her bachelorette party and get along.<br/><br/>At the bachelorette party, a multi-hyphenate psychic, Madame Jen, offers to give Anna and Tess a reading. Lily and Harper argue in the corner, and Madame Jen interrupts them. Madame Jen tells them, 'Change the hearts you know are wrong, so that you may find where you belong.' Harper thinks she belongs in LA and Lily London. The four feel an earthquake. Tess and Anna try to ignore it.<br/><br/>Harper, Tess, Lily, and Anna return to Tess's home. They make Lily and Harper sleep in the living room to force them to be friendly. They sleep through the night. When Harper wakes up, her face and hands feel dry. Tess hears her daughter's yell and wakes on the couch. She notices her bones feel better. Tess and Lily switched bodies, like Anna and Harper. They ask Harper and Lily if Madame June said anything to break the curse. They lie and say no. Lily and Harper will use the swap to break up their parents' wedding in a few days.<br/><br/>Sound the alarm! This sequel respects the original while being a multigenerational, heartfelt, funny film. Like the first movie, the script features a wedding on the line, with a new husband, but changes by adding a relocation and Lily's deceased mother. For the die-hard fans, everyone returns. The Pink Slips, Harry, and Mama P make a satisfying comeback for the fans. The writers hide easter eggs with the soundtrack, decor, jokes, and food. Freakier Friday is a comedy with great timing and physicality. It celebrates complicated family dynamics without muting anyone's perspectives or feelings. You will leave this movie as you did the first, feeling seen and seeing. This film is a sequel that's worth seeing in theaters and is worth the wait.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Bad Guys 2",
    "review": "The Bad Guys enjoy life on parole but can't find employment. Mr. Piranha, Ms. Web, and Mr. Shark anxiously wait to hear if Mr. Wolf got work, but they are disappointed. Mr. Snake slithers in to grab his yoga mat. The crew gawks at Mr. Snake's change and doesn't understand how he can be so happy. Mr. Shark thinks they should worry about the Phantom Bandit heists. It's only a matter of time before people blame them for the Phantom's crime spree.<br/><br/>Mr. Wolf spars with Governor Diana Fox. She advises him to win over the town by doing good publicly. Mr. Wolf has an idea and drives to the police station. He and his crew examine the evidence of the heists with Commissioner Misty Luggins. They spot the culprits in the photo and discover that the stolen items contain MacGuffinite.<br/><br/>The team researches and finds that the Lords of Lucha championship title contains the precious metal. They think the Phantom Bandit will strike at the wrestling match. They arrive at the match and spot Mr. Snake with his new girlfriend, Susan. The crew sees the belt hanging over the ring. They deduce that the challenger is the Bandit. They jump into the squared circle and battle for the belt. However, instead of applause, someone frames them for stealing the belt by putting it on Mr. Piranha. Susan hijacks a hotdog cart and saves them. She offers the crew mints, but Mr. Wolf rejects them. Mr. Wolf asks Susan to pull over so he can call Diane and explain that they are innocent. Mr. Wolf returns the van to find the Bad Guys asleep. Susan shoots Mr. Wolf with a dart.<br/><br/>The team wakes up to the Bad Girls. Pig Tails is the muscle. During the match, she hid in plain sight as the challenging luchador. Susan is Doom, a sweet-talker and long-con expert. The mastermind, Kitty Kat, introduces herself. She wants the Bad Guy to help them with their next heists. Mr. Wolf says no. Kitty Kat threatens to expose Diane's secret life as the Crimson Paw if he doesn't assist. Mr. Wolf agrees, but he assures his crew that he has an ace up his sleeve. Can the Bad Guys do good and protect Diane's reputation?<br/><br/>This sequel is better than the first. The capers are more outlandish, the jokes are funnier, and the plot delves deeper. This story handles reform and redemption. The animation jumps genres throughout the fight scenes. Typically, this feels disjointed. It works because the graphic artist continued this change throughout the entire film. It makes the art feel more alive and enveloping. Be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene. It gives insight into the plot for The Bad Guys 3. This picture has the crime style of Leverage, the smoothness of Ocean's Eleven, and the fun of The Fast and the Furious. The entire family will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Naked Gun",
    "review": "Lt. Frank Drebin thwarted a bank robbery, but he doesn't see a goon, Sig, leave with the P.L.O.T. device. Frank arrives at the Police Squad headquarters, and Chief Davis is irate. Once again, Frank put the unit in jeopardy by ignoring the law. She takes Frank off the bank robbery case and puts him on collisions.<br/><br/>An electric car drove off a cliff and into a ravine, and Simon Davenport died. Frank examines the scene and finds a peculiar matchbook. However, he ascertains that the death is a suicide. Frank arrives at headquarters, and Ed tells him a beautiful woman is waiting for him. It's Simon's sister, Beth. Before Simon died, he warned Beth that he had a device. Someone could use it to drive people into a violent rage. He told Beth to converse with his boss, Richard Cane, CEO of Edentech, if something happened to him.<br/><br/>Frank attends the Edentech launch party, and Richard calls Frank by his name. Richard wants to work with the police and offer assistance with his technology. During their discussion, Richard lights his cigar with a familiar matchbook. He admits it's from his private club. Frank believes Beth and thinks Richard had something to do with Simon's crash. Can Frank prove it?<br/><br/>This film comically states a need for originality while respecting the past. It does both successfully. While this installation of the Naked Gun franchise is a silly, good time, it's intelligent and courageous. Fans of The Kingsman will recognize the plot, but it doesn't take away from the film. The actors show off their comedic side with well-timed jokes and double entendres. The audience may not have an urge to buy the film, but it will entertain you like its predecessors.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Fantastic Four: First Steps",
    "review": "On Earth-828, the world praises their heroes, dubbing them The Fantastic Four. Four years ago, astronauts Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm went to outer space. A cosmic ray blasted them during their mission, and they gained superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>Today, Sue exits the bathroom and gives her husband, Reed, her positive pregnancy test. They joyously hug and meet Sue's brother, Johnny, and Reed's best friend, Ben, for a dinner prepared by HERBIE. Ben can see the petrified look on Reed's face and deduces that the happy couple will be parents. They celebrate while Reed worries. With their altered DNA, he has no idea what the future will bring for their unborn child.<br/><br/>Over the next few months, Sue negotiates peace talks among all countries and the land of Subterranea. She's preparing for maternity leave when the team receives an alert on their wrist watches. Something has entered the atmosphere. A being on a silver surfboard asks if they are the protectors of the planet. They answer yes. She warns the world that Galactus, Destroyer of Worlds, will arrive on Earth and eat the planet. The Silver Surfer flies away.<br/><br/>The world cheers for the Fantastic Four on Excelsior Launch Day. They locate Galactus just in time to watch him devour a planet. A beam scans their ship but lingers on Sue's stomach. The Silver Surfer enters their spacecraft and invites them to meet Galactus. Galactus says he will spare Earth if they give him their baby. He says the baby hides its true nature from them. Galactus believes the baby will take over his mantle and end his hunger. They refuse, and Galactus uses his powers to make Sue go into labor.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four escapes Galactus's ship, and the Silver Surfer is hot on their trail. They flee to Earth, but not before Sue gives birth to their son, Franklin. They return to a press conference waiting for good news. Sadly, they report that Galactus is coming because they wouldn't give up Franklin. They must find a way to defeat Galactus or lose everything they love. Can the Fantastic Four rescue their family while saving their world?<br/><br/>This film will remind fans why they love superhero movies. The costume and set departments had the ultimate tasks. They had to give the picture a '70s feel while making it futuristic. Their designs expand the imagination and are award-worthy. The script is funny and engaging. Also, Galactus is an old-school villain. He just wants to destroy things. Franklin's CGI isn't perfect, but the team's graphics make up for it. This new adaptation of the iconic superheroes is what fans deserve. The film has a mid- and post-scene. While the mid-credit scene is essential to the future of the MCU, the post-credit scene is for nostalgia.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Smurfs",
    "review": "Over a century ago, four intergalactic evil wizards captured four sentient books. They wanted to use the books to remove the good in the universe. However, one book, Jaunty, escaped to Smurf village before they could use it. Since then, Razamel, Gargamel's little brother, searches for the book so he can join the evil wizards and bring evil to the universe.<br/><br/>Papa deejays while the Smurfs dance. When the music stops, No Name Smurf worries because he doesn't have a thing that sets him apart from the other Smurfs. Papa asks No Name what he wants to be, and he says Magic Smurf. Papa informs No Name that Smurfs can't do magic. Smurfette assures No Name that his thing will come with time. Jaunty hears him and secretly answers his prayer. No Name runs through the village and shows Papa his new thing. Papa screams for No Name to stop.<br/><br/>Razamel's goon, Joel, runs to Razamel's room. He alerts Razamel that they detected an electronic pulse matching the book's signature. Razamel demands that Joel find the book's location. Joel opens a portal and pulls in Papa. Before Papa disappears, he tells the Smurfs to locate Ken. Clumsy Smurf finds an album. It has a note that reads 'Play me from beginning to end to find Ken.' They play it, and a portal to Paris opens. It pulls in several Smurfs.<br/><br/>Moxie Smurf, the head of the International Neighborhood Watch, rescues them and brings them into their headquarters. Ken introduces himself as Papa's brother. He knows their presence means that Papa is in trouble. Ken will help the Smurfs find Papa and save the universe before Razamel finds Jaunty and finishes his evil scheme.<br/><br/>This film lives up to the hype with laugh-out-loud one-liners, an expansive world, and a relatable storyline about finding oneself. The music is catchy, and the plot is sure to entertain the entire family. The animators incorporate several animation techniques, like clay, 2D, and anime. However, these styles don't distract from the disjointed animation of the film. The eyes and mouth appear 2D, while their bodies are 3D. This movie fits into the Smurf lore, but the animation needs work. Viewers should stay for the mid-credit scene and enjoy the 1-minute, silent SpongeBob film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
