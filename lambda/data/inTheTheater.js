    "mtitle":"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes",
    "review":"A human-made virus increased apes' intelligence and gave them the ability to speak, but it did the opposite for humans. One of the apes led them to prosperity. His name was Caesar, but he died many generations ago. Today, the Eagle Clan is a close-knit group that will celebrate the bonding ceremony at sunrise. Noa, urged by his mother, runs to his father, Koro, with his eagle egg. Koro is proud but smells a unique scent on Noa's blanket. Noa admits an Echo - their name for a human - took his blanket, but Noa retrieved it. Koro demands to know if Noa went into the valley. Noa truthfully says no.<br/><br/>Noa catches an odor coming from a tent and investigates. He finds a female Echo hiding inside and scares it away. The Echo charges past him and breaks his egg. He needs it for the ceremony. So, he travels into the forest to get a new one. He hears the Coastal Clan riding on their horses and hides. They see Noa's horse in the woods, shock it, and follow it to the Eagle Clan.<br/><br/>Noa hurries home to warn the others, but it's too late. Proximus, leader of the Coastal Clan, had his army attack the Eagle clan and take them prisoner. Noa wakes up in the morning. The Coastal Clan killed Koro and stole the Eagle Clan. Noa travels through the valley and vows to bring them back. Noa will learn the truth about Caesar, the Echos, and Proximus's greatest desire. Proximus is hunting the female Echo because she is the key to the evolution of his Kingdom of Apes.<br/><br/>This latest Planet of the Apes installment has mesmerizing graphics, heart-warming laughs, and a captivating storyline. The plot slows when Noa uncovers Promxius's plan and meets Raka. Don't get confused. This film occurs several generations after Caesar died. One thing Apes and Humans want is knowledge. It's the key to their survival, but can they coexist? This plot point is the movie's standout. Planet fans should keep their eyes and ears open for a few easter eggs. And there aren't any post-credit scenes, but the movie leaves room for another film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Not Another Church Movie",
    "review":"TV Host Hoprah Windfall wants to pass the torch and find someone to inspire women worldwide. So, she calls God for help. God chooses Taylor Pharry - pronounced Harry - to be the one. He tells Taylor to write a play that will become a national sensation.<br/><br/>Taylor is a doctor, lawyer, entrepreneur, and food delivery man. He helped his cousin, Ellen, divorce her husband, Darnell. He knew Darnell would make the divorce difficult, so he called his Aunt Madude to help.<br/><br/>Later, Taylor's friend, Julie, calls because she needs a new driver. He calls his cousin, Monte Carlo, to assist. Monte has three little girls and could use the extra income. God reminds Taylor to write a play. However, Taylor can't come up with an idea. God tells Taylor to use his family. Taylor considers writing about his cousin, Bethany. Her absent father put Bethany in his will. Taylor needs to be careful. Whenever God has a plan, the Devil finds a way to destroy it.<br/><br/>This parody movie ties all the plotlines you know into one film. However, those plotlines don't have a solution. It's stories Taylor will write later to become a famous playwright and media mogul. While the movie pokes fun at church film clich√©s, it doesn't produce many laughs. After the credits, they ask the audience to share it. But don't feel obligated because viewers can wait for this movie to come to cable.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Abigail",
    "review":"Abigail finishes her ballet practice and gets into her chauffeured vehicle. She settles for the night. Then, three masked intruders jump out and pounce on the child. Two hold her down while another injects Abigail with a sedative.<br/><br/>They arrive at their destination and put Abigail into a bedroom. The negotiator, Lambert, tells them to keep Abigail alive for 24 hours while he extorts her father for money. One of the kidnappers asks what they should call each other if they can't exchange names. So, Lambert gives them code names. The sedative injector is Joey. The hacker is Sammy, while the muscle is Peter. Dean is the driver, and Rickles is the weapons expert. Frank rounds out the crew with his short temper. Lambert reminds everyone that Joey is the only person allowed to communicate with Abigail and leaves.<br/><br/>Joey visits Abigail. Abigail fears they will hurt her, but Joey pinky-promises they won't. Then, Abigail warns Joey they made a mistake. Abigail says her father doesn't care about her.<br/><br/>The team splits for the night, and Dean goes to the kitchen. Then, something grabs and decapitates him. Sammy finds Dean's body and screams. Frank barges into Abigail's room and demands her father's name. Frank runs to the team and panics because Abigail's father is Kristof Lazar. Rickles knows the lore surrounding the legendary crimelord and decides to leave. Then, something kills Rickles. Frank wants to kill Abigail. He runs to her room with a gun, but Joey stops him after remembering her pinky promise. While they argue, Sammy notices Abigail remove her restraints with ease. Then Abigail transforms into a dancing vampire. She is Kristof's hitwoman, and she will make them pay. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This movie is a bloody, funny mystery with a brilliant ensemble. It's not a traditional horror movie, but it provides entertaining jump scares. The script takes a while to reveal Abigail's powers. It's necessary because it allows the viewers to connect with each character. While the crew makes typical horror mistakes, they get some actions correct. If you like M3GAN, this film is for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Civil War",
    "review":"The President of the United States hosts a press conference to update the nation on its state. He assures the people that the Western Forces will fall. He reiterates that the Loyalist States will reign supreme after the war concludes and accept the Californians and Texans back into the United States.<br/><br/>Lee photographs water riots in New York. She sees another photojournalist get hit and pulls the journalist out of the way. Lee warns the young reporter to wear a press vest when a bomb explodes. Later, Lee meets with her colleague, Joel, in a hotel lobby. New York Times veteran journalist Sammy wants to know what they have planned next. Joel reluctantly admits they are driving to DC to interview the president. Sammy advises them to go west to Pittsburg and head towards West Virginia instead of taking a direct route. Then, Sammy asks if they can drop him off at the South Carolina front lines. Lee and Joel woefully agree. Lee sees the young journalist from the bombing in the lobby, and Jessie introduces herself.<br/><br/>Lee meets Joel at their van and shockingly sees Jessie in the car beside Sammy. Joel tells Lee that Jessie is 23 years old and green but ready. He promises to drop Jessie off at the Carolina border with Sammy. Then, they can travel to DC to interview the president. Lee obliges. This civil war will leave a lasting mark on all of them.<br/><br/>This film gives a dystopian view of America but hits close to home. Now, the script never states the president's political party. So, the writers aren't trying to make a political statement. However, this movie highlights the trauma war reporters suffer through. It's their job to report the news but never intervene. They work through shootings, bombings, and death. This film is a love letter to photojournalism.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead",
    "review":"Tanya shops with friends for their upcoming trip to Mexico. Tanya's mother, Mrs. Crandell, texts Tanya to pick up her brother, Kenny, and come home immediately. Mrs. Crandell had a nervous breakdown at work. She must attend a yoga retreat in Taiwan or risk losing her job. Tanya cancels her trip to care for her siblings, including Melissa and Zack. Before Mrs. Crandell leaves, she hires a babysitter, Mrs. Stuark, to care for the kids. Mrs. Crandell gives Mrs. Stuark an envelope of cash for food.<br/><br/>Kenny reminds Tanya that they planned a party before Mrs. Crandell left. So, Tanya tells Mrs. Stuark they will have a bible study with gospel rap music. Tanya enters Mrs. Stuark's room and finds the babysitter pale and unresponsive. Zack dials 911, but Kenny snatches the phone and hangs up. They believe the cops will blame them for the death. They place Mrs. Stuark in her car after forcing alcohol into her mouth. And they push the car into a lake.<br/><br/>After a few days, the kids run out of food. Their younger brother, Zack, remembers their mother gave Mrs. Stuark cash. Unfortunately, Kenny placed the purse containing the money in Mrs. Stuark's car before submerging it. Melissa creates a fake resum√© and social media presence while Zack coaches Tanya for the interview. Tanya will get one step into the corporate world and learn about her desires, future, and family.<br/><br/>This remake of the 1991 film has the original's foundation while making changes to incorporate today's technology and social sentiments. The characters have the same name, including Sue Ellen, but you have to watch to hear it. And original cast members make cameo appearances. This remake respects the source material while passing the torch. It's funny but not for a younger audience. While you won't run to the theaters to watch, it will be worth a BET+ free trial.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
