    "review":"Days ago, Ethan got a message to find his ally Ilsa Faust and obtain the missing half of a cruciform key. After giving Ethan his instructions, Eugene Kittridge loses contact with Ethan. Kittridge sits in a classified meeting with Director Denlinger and his advisors and reveals information about Impossible Mission Force. Kittridge explains that experimental Artificial Intelligence meant to hack digital information went rogue and became self-aware and self-learning. They call it the Entity, the biggest threat to the world. They need Ethan to destroy it because other world powers know about the Entity and seek to harness it for global domination. Ethan must remain resilient against his past to secure the world's future. But can Ethan risk the ones he loves?<br/><br/>Based on the TV series, this Mission Impossible installment is the seventh in the franchise and lives up to the crazy stunts and spine-tingling drama of the previous six. The writers inject the right amount of humor at the most opportune moments. New fans don't need to see the previous movies to understand this film. The plot sticks to AI and Machine Learning fears in other films, but the action sets it apart. There are zero mid-credit or post-credit scenes. And yes, it ends on the perfect cliffhanger. Fans of the franchise won't be disappointed and will look forward to part two.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny",
    "review":"Indiana Jones and Basil Shaw battle the Nazis to recover the Lance of Longinus on a Nazi plunder train. However, Jones and the Nazi astrophysicist JÃ¼rgen Voller discover the artifact is fake. Among the train relics, Voller found Antikythera, a mechanism to locate fissures in time. Jones and Shaw battle Voller on the train and steal the Antikythera from Voller. Shaw is happy to have the device, but Jones knows they only have half of it.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones teaches his last class and retires. He goes to the local pub to celebrate, and a student sits beside him. He doesn't recognize her immediately until she tells Jones her name: Helena Shaw. She is Basil's daughter and Jones's goddaughter. She wants to know more about the relic and its current location. She believes Basil knew where to find the other half. Jones takes Helena to the school's archives and removes the machine from a hidden drawer. When CIA operatives distract Jones, Helena grabs the Dial and runs away.<br/><br/>The operatives work for Voller, who now hides as a NASA scientist on the recently-successful Apollo 11 project. They murder Jones's former co-worker but can't find Helena. Jones tries to call for help after discovering his co-worker's body, but an operative stops and grabs Jones. Jones manipulates the Apollo parade to escape and runs to Sallah for assistance. Sallah uncovered that Helena isn't a student. She is a grifter who sells historical artifacts on the black market. Jones must find Helena and the Dial before Voller finds them.<br/><br/>This review will feel disjointed because the action is missing to remove spoilers. The movie nods to the original but doesn't alienate new viewers. Helena is brilliant, but she isn't an archeologist. While she displays a careless exterior, Jones sees her passion for history and Basil's legacy. Jones is a hero without a purpose. He needs this mission to remember the man he wants to be. This new installment has a temporal plot. But it's not the film's focus. The storyline is about the hunt, not time travel. Audiences should see this movie on the big screen and fall in love for the first time or all over again.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"No Hard Feelings",
    "review":"Maddie runs outside to see her ex-fling, Doug, hooking her car to his tow truck. Furious that Maddie ghosted him, Doug drives away with her car. The property taxes on her mother's home increased with the influx of wealthy residents. Maddie bartends and drives to cover the cost but has no idea how to do it without her car.<br/><br/>Maddie meets with her pregnant friend, Sara, and Sara's husband, Jim, to brainstorm ways to get a new car. While on Craigslist, Sara spots a post from a mom and dad. Their son is going to college, and they want someone to 'date' him to make their son more social. If the woman completes the task, they will give her a Buick with 40,000 miles and a clean title.<br/><br/>Maddie rollerblades to Allison and Laird's home to discuss the arrangement. First, she assures them she is not a prostitute, just a woman who needs a car. Second, Maddie is older than the age requirement. However, she promises to handle the job with maturity and tact. They hire Maddie and request she organically meets their 19-year-old son, Percy. Percy will attend Princeton in the fall but only makes friends online. They give Maddie Percy's work schedule at the animal shelter and send her on her way. Can this Maneater help this socially awkward teen while earning a car to save her home?<br/><br/>This movie covers everything right and wrong in America while making you laugh. It opens up about gentrification, bullying, abandonment, and helicopter parents. Maddie and Percy make blunders during their meet-cute and subsequent dates. The plot doesn't rely on toilet humor to elicit laughter. It depends on throwing two different people into a normal situation with the best rendition of Maneater in a film. Percy finds his backbone during the movie while Maddie analyzes her choices. This film is a wild ride, but the ending is satisfying. A warning to parents: this movie has full-frontal nudity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ember Lumen works for her dad, Bernie, at his convenience store, Fireplace. He creates food from his old country for the citizens of Fire City. And his wife, Cindy, reads customers' 'love smoke' in the back. Bernie hopes to retire and turn the place over to Ember. But only when she is ready. Ember is close, but her frustration with customers overcomes her and causes her to burst into flames.<br/><br/>Ember opens the shop in the morning to excited customers. However, it's too much, and she runs to the basement to explode. The pipes burst. Ember uses her heat to weld the metal and tries to figure out how to clear the water. She sees strange movement in the pool as Wade Ripple emerges from the water, holding her family picture. Wade is a city health inspector and jots down the violations. Ember pleads with Wade to stop because Bernie built it. Wade writes down that Bernie constructed the shop without the proper permits. Wade runs out of the store and on an Element City Train to report the violations to City Hall. Ember follows him and leaves Fire Town for the first time.<br/><br/>He files the paperwork as Ember falls devastated. The glow from Ember and her words sparks compassion in Wade. Wade knows a way to help. They can speak to Gale Cumulus, his boss, to halt the Fireplace's closure.<br/><br/>Wade mentions that water came through the pipes in Fire Town. Gale doesn't understand how this happened because the city shut off water to Fire Town years ago. Wade tells Gale he was looking for the source of a leak but was sucked into the pipe and landed in the Fireplace. Gale says she won't close the shop if they find the leak and stop it. She must save the Fireplace because it's her family's legacy and future. But is it the future she wants, or will chemistry find a new destiny for her?<br/><br/>This movie is an immigrant's tale. They leave their homeland after a natural or unnatural event. They come to a new world to start a better life but find hardship and exclusion. They pass that tradition and pride to Ember. Ember wants to be a good daughter and follow the path Bernie laid for her to follow. She never considered there could be another way. Then, she meets Wade. Wade has an abundant life but misses his deceased dad. He expresses his emotions and sees the best in others. Ember's ability to mold the world around her awes Wade. He doesn't understand why she can't leave her family's expectations behind. That difference is the film's core: an immigrant's duties versus a citizen's dreams. Also, the opening short film, Carl's Date, is an instant classic. So, everyone should be on time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
