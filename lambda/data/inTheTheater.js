    "review":"General Erinmore wants Blake and Schofield to send a message to the 2nd battalion of the Devonshire Regiment.  The Regiment's leader,  Colonel Mackenzie, believes he has the upper hand because the Germans have retreated.  However, this was a strategic maneuver.   The Germans moved their line 9 miles back to ambush them with an attack like no other seen in the war.  Blake and Schofield must find Colonel Mackenzie and tell him to stop the attack.  If Blake and Schofield don't deliver the message in time, 1600 men - including Blake's older brother - will die.  Blake wants to leave now but Schofield tells him to wait until nightfall.  Schofield has been through this before and received a medal for his service.  Hearing his brother is in danger has lit a fire inside Blake, he is determined to go with or without Schofield now.  The two men leave the trenches to carry out their mission.<br/><br/>With well-choreographed, continuous shots, this story - derived from the director's grandfather's accounts - will leave you with awe, heartbreak, and pride.  These men conquer rats, barbed wire, tripwire, being buried alive, and the enemy with a stiff upper lip and bravery.  With each step, they are reminded of the danger that lies ahead.  They run across dead horses and dead men being eaten by scavengers and rotting away on the battlefield.  You should view this movie on the largest screen possible to enjoy its majesty.  Be warned: if you or a loved one suffer from battle-related P.T.S.D., this movie may be too much for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Howie allows Kevin Garnett to borrow a precious, uncut black opal with his championship ring as collateral. He tells Kevin he needs the opal back in time for the auction. Howie takes Garnett's ring and pawns it for gambling money. He hopes the bet will cover his losses, payback bookies, and get Kevin's ring back, so he can get the opal. Once at auction, Howie believes the Opal will fetch $1,000,000. However, someone stopped his bet. Now, he must stay one step ahead while everyone is on his tail.<br/><br/>This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. You have no idea which way is up the entire time of the movie. There are no good guys or bad guys in the movie, only hustlers. Each time Howie is one step ahead, he gets knocked backward. Get ready for one huge roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lance is upset his bomb released glitter and a video of a cat. This mishap allowed Killian to scan is face and almost get away with a killer drone.

Instead of inquiring about the invention, Lance fires Walter. Lance takes the drone to his boss but she discovers the drone is missing. Marcy has a video of Lance stealing it. Lance knows Killian set him up. Lance escapes and wishes he could disappear to find Killian. Lance knocks on Walter's door. Without question, Lance drinks Walter's invention and is turned into a pigeon. When Lance asks to be changed back, Walter admits he doesn't have an antidote. If Walter makes the antidote, Lance will get him re-hired. Together, they will make one strong non-killing team.<br/><br/>This movie will have you laughing while working through a tough subject. Lance believes that criminals should be taken down even with deadly force. Even has a child, Walter dreamed of making weapons to save the world but not kill. He still believes it’s possible. You only need to see this movie in 2D format, anything else is unnecessary. Parents, just a warning, there is a 15-second moment of cartoon butt and some subtitles.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Joe leaves New York to be by her youngest sister's bedside. Beth's illness has weakened her heart and she doesn't have much longer to live. Meg, who lives close to Beth, loves her family but wishes she had more money. Amy, an artist, is not told about the severity of her sister's illness. Beth knows painting in Paris is Amy's dream and she doesn't want to ruin it. As the little women are together, they reminisce about their lives. The betrayal, encouragement, and love within their sisterly bond will bring them closer together as they lose their sister.<br/><br/>This plotline is not given linearly. It moves between now and the past within the blink of an eye. So you have to pay attention to the subtle changes in the women’s appearances. Each actress brings everything to her role and leaves you in awe. This movie will make you curious to read the book and see how it differs from the movie. While it is a good watch, you won’t have an urge to buy it. One viewing is enough to appreciate its artistry.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 2018, the world at Fox News was not ready for the storm looming behind the hills. On-air talent Gretchen Carlson was meeting with her lawyers to create an argument for her harassment claim. She has found a way to sue Roger Ailes and not Fox News. When Gretchen comes forward, dozens will follow. Including Megyn Kelly. When everyone has to take sides, who can be trusted and who will be left standing?<br/><br/>Based on a true scandal, this movie should be seen as an outline of the events, not gospel. Their views on what happened and why can be derived from their real-life interviews. These women went from reporting the news to being a part of the story. The Fox News scandal will be a case study for years to come.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
