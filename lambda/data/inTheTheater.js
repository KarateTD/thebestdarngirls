    "review":"John trains as the Bowery King brings him a new suit. After hiding underground, John travels to Morocco to meet the new Elder of the High Table. John asks the Elder for his ring and freedom. The Elder tells John the wedding ring is long gone with the previous Elder. And they won't free John either. John stands and shoots the Elder in the head.<br/><br/>Marquis Vincent de Gramont visits the New York Continental Hotel. He strips Winston of his title and condemns the hotel because Winston didn't kill John. And he wants to put an end to John Wick. It starts with New York. Vincent will make every city respect the High Table by demolishing John's flagship hotel. Vincent pulls out his gun and kills Charon. Charon is Winston's consequence for deceiving the High Table.<br/><br/>Vincent leaves New York and travels to Paris. He summons Caine, John's friend and a retired assassin for the High Table, for a meeting. Vincent gives Caine a card with his mark's name: John Wick. Caine sighs and agrees.<br/><br/>John runs to the Osaka Continental to meet with the manager, Koji, against the wishes of his concierge, Akira. No one sees Tracker in the lobby with a notebook full of information about John Wick. The bounty of $15,000,000 isn't enough for Tracker, but he will keep an eye on John while it rises. John tells Koji that he plans to kill every member of the High Table. Koji warns John that John's path will only lead to more killing and destruction.<br/><br/>John meets with Winston, who agrees with Koji, to offer condolences for the Continental and Charon. Winston offers John a better idea. Winston tells John to request a duel against Vincent. According to legend, a family must sponsor him in the duel, and he tore his ticket to gain passage. John needs to find a new family, obtain a ticket, request a duel, and kill Marquis Vincent de Gramont to free himself of the High Table for good.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of John Wick packs more plot than its predecessors but maintains all the action. The battles were well-timed, in sync with the music, and innovative. If you haven't seen the previous three films, watch them before watching this film. The movie doesn't take the time to catch viewers up on what happened and why. This film is funnier and wiser than the first three films. Don't worry, because this film has a lot of blood, guns, axes, and nunchucks. So it has all the cringe-inducing violence you love. The downside to this film is the unrealistic survival. Viewers could believe one man could live through these battles, but a 50-foot drop onto the pavement is too far for any stretch of your imagination. This movie is a fitting conclusion for John Wick fans with new characters and locations. Also, it has one post-credit scene at the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Billy wants his family to fight crime together, but everyone wants to explore separate interests. Mary understands what Billy is going through. In 5 months, Billy will age out of the system, and his foster parents, Victor and Rosa, can barely afford rent. Mary tells Billy to get a job and contribute or go to college. A therapist also diagnosed Billy with imposter syndrome because Billy feels like the Wizard picked the wrong person. Each time the family tries to save the day, they do more harm than good. The newspaper dubbed them the Philly Fiascos.<br/><br/>Freddy overhears a museum robbery over the scanners. Two women walked into the Acropolis Museum, stole an artifact, and turned the visitors into dust. Later, the Wizard enters Billy's dream with a warning. The daughters of Atlas - Hespera, Kalypso, and Anthea - entered Billy's realm. They want to find the golden apple and use its seeds to recreate the Tree of Life. Centuries ago, human wizards grew tired of the games the gods played with people. So they stole a branch off the Tree of Life, created the staff, took their magic, and trapped the daughters in their realm. They would stay powerless in their realm if the Wizard's staff stayed intact. Billy remembers having the Wizard's staff, breaking it in half, and leaving it after their battle with Dr. Thaddeus and the Seven Deadly Sins. They need to find the third sister, the staff, and the golden apple to save their realm from the Fury of the Gods.<br/><br/>Welcome D.C.E.U. fans to a sequel that's better than the first. Billy introduces the audience to his family and their growth over two years. It's not necessary to see the first movie to understand the second, but it helps you see the nuances and changes in Billy's family dynamics. The script never has a dull moment, and the jokes are often sly. Family bonds are at the forefront of this film. The graphics are stunning during the fights and doesn't distract the audience. If you are a fan of the first, this movie will not disappoint. So see it with your preteens and stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. And yes, you get a D.C.E.U. surprise.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Pilot Mills, from Planet Somaris, embarks on a 2-year exploratory mission in space. Typically, his missions last six weeks, but his daughter, Nevine, is ill, and this mission pays three times his salary. During the mission, Mills wakes up to sirens blaring because debris from a meteorite hit the ship, and the aircraft goes into manual mode. Mills crash lands on an unknown planet and assesses the damage. Everyone in cryosleep died, and several escape pods got damaged except for 2, which are missing. He decides to end his life but thinks about Nevine. Then, his detection device picks up a distress beacon from a cryopod. He finds a young girl, Koa, alive inside the pod, but it's failing. He walks Koa to his aircraft and notices a massively large footprint. He sees a reflection of light in the distance. His device says it's one of the missing escape pods, and the pod is 15 kilometers away.. Mills wants to take Koa to the escape pod and coordinate a rendezvous point for a rescue crew to find him. Mills doesn't know that the unknown planet is Earth - 65 million years ago.<br/><br/>Mills is a man facing an unfathomable situation. He is on a planet he doesn't know, with a kid who speaks a different language, and dinosaurs surround him. They deal with tar pits, quicksand, cave-ins, and a dislocated shoulder. The plot doesn't have unnecessary love stories, drama, or altruistic speeches. It's 15 minutes of setup followed by action. The director made a risky choice to display a portion of a fight scene between Mills and a dinosaur on the handheld device. Viewers got a 3D pixelated fight that amps the suspense. The plot reveals two other secrets: Mills's reason for wanting to end his life and a ticking clock. You may not want to buy this movie, but it's worth the price of admission and a few jump scares.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre",
    "review":"Nathan gets a call from his superior. Thieves broke into a lab in Johannesburg and stole something worth $10 billion. However, they don't know what the thieves stole, but they call it 'The Handle.' Nathan must create a team and uncover the buyer, seller, and what the thieves stole. The fallout will be catastrophic if The Handle falls into the wrong hands. Nathan knows the best person for the job: Orson Fortune.<br/><br/>Nathan goes to Morocco to convince Orson to take the job. Nathan hired J.J. and Sarah. J.J. can do, fire, and drive anything. Sarah is a tech-savvy con artist. Orson asks if John is coming. Sadly, Mike, the leader of another team, poached John from Nathan. Nathan collected intel that the deal's broker is Greg, but Greg keeps the seller and the buyer apart. Greg's courier will bring the item to Madrid and give it to Greg.<br/><br/>Orson, Sarah, and J.J. cover the airport and spot the courier with an alligator case. However, something is off. Orson realizes someone is working their job at the airport. They grab the courier and the briefcase and pull them into a van. They open the case and find an encrypted hard drive. Sarah starts to clone it when the courier has a heart attack. He tells him where to meet Greg. If they don't deliver the drive, Greg will kill the courier's wife. The man dies, but Orson sees the second team. It's Mike's team.<br/><br/>Now, they are in a race to get to Greg. Luckily for them, Greg has a fascination with celebrities. And his favorite is Danny Francesco. Sarah discovers that Greg is having a charity auction on a boat. With Danny by their side, they will get an invite. They have to convince Danny to go. Then, they can find the buyer and seller, return the drive to their government, and save the world.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is a master's class in sound engineering because the action flows on beat with Nathan's footsteps down the hall. In Guy Ritchie form, the cast of characters gets a quick introduction and background. Then, you get steeped into a sexy and funny mystery with guns, explosions, and terrorists. This strategy worked for The Gentleman, but it falls incredibly flat here. This film follows this director's formula but is dull, unamusing, and unimaginative. This movie is for Netflix, not the big screen.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
