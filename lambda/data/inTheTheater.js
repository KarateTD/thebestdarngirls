    "mtitle":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",
    "review":"Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael love to record themselves performing stunts, watch movies, and eat pizza. People would consider them normal teenagers, but they live in the New York City Sewers because they are mutant turtles. Their father, Splinter, knows the human world won't be kind to them. Splinter taught them to defend themselves and to fear evil deadly humans.<br/><br/>After creative grocery shopping, the boys practice their ninja skills on fruit. They throw a ninja star, and it slices through the watermelon and lodges itself into a young woman's bike helmet. April's beauty captivates Leonardo. As they argue over socializing with a human, April screams at them from below to converse. Then they see someone steal April's scooter and go after him. They discover a chop shop and use their skills to immobilize the thieves. The turtles come out of the shadows, and April, an aspiring journalist, wants to know more about them.<br/><br/>They explain their origin and their dream to join the human world. April understands how they feel because she's an outsider in high school. Then, they get an idea. A rash of robberies put the city on high alert, and they want to enact a curfew and cancel the prom. If April films the boys taking down the leader, Superfly, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can come out of the shadows. And the city will lift the curfew, and the prom will continue. April, Donatello, Leonardo, Rafael, and Michelangelo will be heroes.<br/><br/>Parents and kids will have an easy laugh throughout this movie. While the film alters Splinter's story, it remains true to the Turtles' saga. Parents will instantly connect to the second movie with one song. Kids will connect to the characters' use of social media to reach an unexplored but judgmental world. The graphics uniquely capture your attention. It's computer animation, but they made it look like a comic book. The humor is for the whole family. Stay for the mid-credit scene. And you don't need 3D to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Meg 2: The Trench",
    "review":"Jonas captures eco-terrorists with Mac while assisting Mana One and caring for his stepdaughter, Meiying. Meiying's uncle, Jiuming, took over the facility after his father, Minway, and sister, Suyin, died. Years ago, they captured a baby Meg, Haiqi, and raised it in captivity near Hainan Island. Jiuming notices that Haiqi's behavior is changing. Jiuming's business partner, Hilary, wants the team to continue researching the uncharted trench below the thermocline.<br/><br/>Jonas, Jiuming, and a crew enter a submersible for routine exploration. On the Mana One command post, DJ and Jess spot an irregularity on the sub. It's Meiying. She snuck onboard with her gear after Jonas said she couldn't come. At 25,000 feet underwater, Jiuming spots Haiqi. She broke out to mate with other Megs. Then, they uncover an illegal mining station at the bottom of the trench. Before they can make contact, the station's captain, Montes, sets off an explosion, damaging their sub. Jonas calls to the surface to send help. But someone impaired the rescue pods. Without help, Jonas, Jiuming, Meiying, and the crew will wear exosuits and walk the trench floor to the mining station, passing the dangerous creatures above while exposing the miners and the saboteurs on Mana One.<br/><br/>Over five years, Jonas changed from a loner to a family man. He doesn't want to quell Meiying's spirit but desires to keep her safe. Based on The Trench by Steve Alten, the plot is captivating, with a few jump scares and crazy scenarios. It's what you expect from a humourous, slightly over-the-top action movie. It packs an entertaining, outlandish plot with nods to its predecessor. The graphics make it worth seeing on the big screen, but not in 3D. It will be a cult classic for anyone looking for mindless fun.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Haunted Mansion",
    "review":"Doctor Gabbie and Travis move to New Orleans to turn a large mansion into a bed and breakfast. After noticing a lot of unexplained incidences, they both leave. But they later return and call Father Kent to perform an exorcism on the home. Father Kent attempts to clear the home but fails, so he researches others who can help. He discovers that Ben, an astrophysicist, created a camera lens to capture spirits in images. Father Kent asks Ben to bring his camera to Gabbie's home and take pictures for $2,000.<br/><br/>Upon arriving, Ben noticed his camera's battery died. But he goes to Gabbie's doorstep anyway. Gabbie warns Ben that if he enters the home, it will change the course of his life forever. He takes a few fake photos, scribbles fraudulent notes, and tells Gabbie the house is free from ghosts. Ben goes home, but a ghost follows him there. The ghost tells Ben to go back. Ben returns with a working camera to discover that Father Kent lives there because the ghost forced him to return too. They get more resources. First, they find a historian, Professor Bruce, to dig up the home's past owners and what happened in the home. Next, they need a psychic, Harriet, to learn what the ghosts want. With their dream team, can they clear the house to free themselves from it?<br/><br/>Based on Haunted Mansion, this standalone sequel mixes strong themes of grief and loss with well-timed humor and horror. The movie is the embodiment of New Orleans, where funeral parades turn sadness into joy. Yes, it has a few jump scares, but it's equivalent to Scooby Doo with Disney-quality animation. It's fun but more appropriate for older kids and adults because it delves into serial murder and mentions a mistress. There are zero post-credit scenes, but it ends with a New Orleans-style party. This movie is gentle about death while being funny and a little scary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Barbie",
    "review":"Barbie lives in her dreamhouse. She takes a waterless shower, eats her perfect pretend breakfast, and floats to her car. Barbie goes to the beach to relax, and Ken waits for Barbie to notice him. Ken asks to visit Barbie's house, and she invites him to her blowout party with choreography.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Barbie's party until Barbie asks them if they think about death. She laughs it off and continues dancing. In the morning, Barbie wakes up tired, her waterless shower is cold, and the pretend breakfast isn't edible. Barbie confesses that something is wrong, and the other Barbies tell her to go to Weird Barbie.<br/><br/>Barbie goes to Weird Barbie and tells her everything that happened. Barbie's little girl in the real world is sad, and it affects how she plays with Barbie. Barbie doesn't understand how this could happen because playing with Barbie made the lives of real girls perfect like her. Barbie heads to the real world with Ken stowing away in the backseat. She will find her girl, help her, and return to Barbieland with her body and mind in tack. However, the real world will change Barbieland in ways Barbie never dreamed, but Ken always imagined.<br/><br/>This movie starts with all the pink, butterflies, and glitter you expect from Barbie. It has all the Barbies you remember as a little child, even discontinued Barbies like Midge, Growing Up Skipper, and TV Barbie. When she enters the real world, she sees it isn't perfect. And little girls aren't thanking her for making a difference. Ken sees the human world and loves it. Men are working, driving big cars, and focusing on each other. The real world has a lasting effect on both of them.<br/><br/>As the trailer says, this film is for people who love and hate Barbie because it focuses on Barbie's issues while addressing her contributions. During the trip to Barbie, Barbie talks to her owner, Sasha, and Sasha's mother, Gloria. Gloria gives a speech to Barbie, who is having an existential crisis, and it will make you sigh with understanding and exhaustion. You leave this film with your eyes open, your feelings heard, and loving Barbie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Oppenheimer",
    "review":"J. Robert Oppenheimer sits in front of a security hearing board because he wants to maintain his security clearance. He recounts his life before and during his government work under scads scrutiny. He teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and dedicates time to the California Institute of Technology. Oppenheimer crosses paths with Ernest Lawrence, Jean Tatlock, and his future wife, Katherine Puening.<br/><br/>General Leslie Groves seeks out Oppenheimer to work on the Manhattan Project but worries Oppenheimer's communist ties will delay his clearance. Oppenheimer assures Groves that he only has an academic interest in the party, not a devotion. Oppenheimer wasn't sure about creating the Atomic Bomb but wanted to end World War II. So he agreed to do it because the only scientist in Germany with Oppenheimer's knowledge was Jewish. They know Hitler won't give him funding.<br/><br/>Oppenheimer convinces Groves to create a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with places to pray, shop, and attend school. Oppenheimer and his researchers work before the town is complete, and William L. Borden enters with startling calculations. His math proves the Atomic Bomb could cause an explosion in the atmosphere and create a chain reaction that destroys the world. Oppenheimer asks Lewis Strauss to introduce him to Albert Einstein. He gives Albert the calculations, and Albert confirms them. Oppenheimer must continue his work with the constant threat of annihilation hanging over his head. And he will bring death to thousands if it works as expected. Can Oppenheimer accept the applause and responsibility of being a modern-day Prometheus?<br/><br/>The director made this movie with extreme precision for the period, the scientists, and their struggles. If you pay close attention, this historical film has the drama of a daytime soap opera. This movie follows Oppenheimer's life before, during, and after the Atomic Bomb. It acknowledges his flaws and brilliance throughout his career. Also, it addresses some controversies and conspiracies that surrounded him. This battle is compelling because it's between two competitive, intelligent, and petty men. This movie covers ample history, but it's not for children.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
