    "review": "Thomas sits at his desk creating a video game named Binary when he gets a warning that a hacker purged the Modal 101 file.  While Thomas looks into the hack, Jude tells him their boss, Smith, wants to see him.  Their parent company, Warner Brothers, wants to make a sequel to his trilogy game, The Matrix.  And they will make it with or without Thomas.  Thomas starts to panic because he had a mental breakdown after creating the game.  He couldn't discern reality from dreams.  Now, Thomas sees a therapist to maintain his mental state.<br/><br/>Thomas goes to a coffee shop with co-worker Jude, and Jude forces Thomas to talk to a woman he fixates on every day.  The woman is Tiffany, and she is married with two sons.  Later, they see each other and question him about his game.  She thinks a character, Trinity, looks like her.  Thomas goes back to his office, and an alarm forces an evacuation.  Before Thomas leaves the building, he gets a text message to go to the bathroom.  A man walks out of the stall and introduces himself as Morpheus, and Thomas panics.  Thomas runs to his therapists to handle reality but ends up on top of the roof.  He attempts to jump off and fly when Bugs grabs him.  She tells him the Matrix is real and shows her bunny tattoo.  Her world knows him as the one Neo, and he follows her into the Matrix.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the trilogy has all the effects and wild storylines from its predecessor.  It shows clips of the past for people new to the series.  But, there are phrases, jokes, and other nuances you won't understand without seeing the other films.  While it created an end to the trilogy, it left the door open for something new for the next generation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "In 1902, the Duke of Oxford, Orlando, his wife, Emily, and their son, Conrad, brought Red Cross aid to a concentration camp in South Africa.  Gunshots ring out outside.  Their driver, Shola, protected Conrad, but Emily was fatally wounded.  Before she died, she made Orlando promise that Conrad would never see war.  Twelve years later, Orlando attempts to stop any war before it happens.  They discover someone wants to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand and ignite the Great War.  Through his group of servants, Orlando learns that Gavrilo is a pawn.  And his master has influencers by the side of Tsar Nicholas, King George, and Kaiser Wilhelm.  Orlando has a dire need to end it when Conrad wants to sign up to fight.  To keep his promise to Emily, Orlando will find the person at the top of the evil empire and take them down.  In turn, he constructs an organization called the Kingsman.<br/><br/>The prequel to the franchise plays fast and loose with history but maintains the names and cause for the Great War.  While viewers will get the Kingsman's development, they won't get the style and grace they remember.  Weapons and clothing of the time shouldn't hinder the eye-catching cinematography.  While the first two movies were new and fresh, this one was slow and a bit unimaginative.  Also, the post-credits hint for a part two that you can predict.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Buster Moon's theater is a raging success with its latest rendition of Alice in Wonderland.  During the performance, Miss Crawly watches Suki in the audience.  Suki is an agent for Crystal Entertainment.  Suki starts to leave before the second act, and Buster chases after her to find out why.  She tells Buster that the show is cute but not ready for the big leagues. Nana tells Buster that nobody can crush his dreams but him.  If he wants something, he needs to fight for it.<br/><br/>Buster comes up with a plan, but he needs one more arrow in his quiver: Ash.  Buster and his friends finagle their way onto the audition stage, but Jimmy won't let them get past their intro.  Jimmy turns to leave.  In an outburst, Gunther says something that makes Jimmy turn around.  Gunther dreamed of a sci-fi play with Clay Calloway as the star.  No one has seen Clay since his wife died. Jimmy agrees to back the show and gives Buster 3 weeks to put it together.  The star, Rosita, needs to make a big dive in her performance.  But she is afraid of heights.  During a progress check, Jimmy's daughter, Porsha, shows Rosita how to do it.  Porsha demands to be the star, and Jimmy makes Buster do it.  But Porsha can't act.  Buster's final hurdle is Clay.  Buster and Ash go to talk to him, but Clay says no.  Ash can see how much Clay is hurting.  So she tells Buster to leave, and she will continue to help Clay take the stage.  After he downgrades Porsha, can Buster pull off the show of his career?<br/><br/>The sequel to Sing has all the laughs and foot-tapping music of the first movie.  But it doesn't have the same inspiring premises as its predecessor.  Also, the funniest moments are in the trailer.  With these few negatives, the movie still entertains with current and original songs.  This sequel makes the film feel final, so it's doubtful they will create a part three.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Before this review begins, there will be 0 spoilers.  It won't go beyond what you have seen in the trailers, promise.  Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "While running from war with triplets, Pedro stopped, kissed his wife, Alma, and headed towards the soldiers.  He sacrificed himself for his family.  Alma fell to the ground in tears.  Then her candle started to glow, and mountains grew around her.  And from nowhere, a house, Casita, formed out of thin air with magic.  However, it wasn't the only magical entity.  When each family member came of age, they would touch the candle, and their door would reveal their gift.  Mirabel is a decedant of one of the triplets.  Unlike her family, she did not get a gift.  Now, the townspeople and the family worry that the same thing will happen to Mirabel's cousin, Antonio.  The entire community watches the ceremony, but Antonio wants Mirabel by his side.  Antonio touches the door and gets the ability to talk to animals.  The town celebrates, and Mirabel walks around thinking about her purpose.  Then she sees the house starting to crack, and the candle's flame almost extinguished.  Mirabel runs to tell the family, but they see nothing and blame it on jealousy.  After talking to several family members, she learns that her estranged uncle Bruno, gifted with premonitions, had a vision of the family losing the magic but never finished his vision.  Mirabel decides to go through Bruno's door and complete his premonition to save her Casita, her family, and the entire town.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't just point out Mirabel's struggles; it allows her and the audience to see that each of her family members has their struggles too. If you ever feel unimportant or under immense pressure, this movie will speak to you and bring a tear to your eye.  With stunning visual effects, this film will engross your whole family.  And be prepared to dance in your seat.  Be aware this movie isn't about good guys versus bad guys.  It's about the struggle we all face within.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
