    "review":"Mason Pettits always wanted to help people as a child, so he became a lawyer. He became disenchanted with the predictability of his life and job. So, he left the law and joined the special forces. Now, his life has a purpose until his last mission. His commanding officer, Sebastian, passed his team the dossier of President Juan Venegas, their next target. Mason abseils from the helicopter and watches someone shoot it down. . Mason returns to law with his purple heart, wife, and daughter by his side. Then, Mason's past walks through the door. Sebastian owns CDI, a security company. He wants to hire Mason to protect an investigative journalist, Claire Wellington. She has an exclusive interview with Juan. Sebastion offers Mason $20,000, and he agrees.<br/><br/>Claire won a Peabody award but fell to disgrace after people discovered her source lied. So she resigned. She hopes interviewing the President of Paldonia will reinvigorate her career.<br/><br/>Juan meets Claire and Mason on the tarmac. Juan and Claire converse and drink in the car while ignoring Mason in the back seat. Then, the car in front blows up. Mason gets Claire and Juan to safety. Mason calls Sebastian to arrange their extraction. Juan calls his nephew, General Jorge, and lets Jorge know he is safe. After Juan hangs up, he tells Mason that Jorge arranged the attack. Juan wants to travel to a neighboring town to do the interview, but Mason says no. He wants to leave with his client, Claire.<br/><br/>They wait in the clearing until their transport descends. However, two armed mercenaries come out, and the helicopter flies away. Mason shoots the helicopter out of the sky. The two mercenaries follow Claire, but Mason takes one of them out. Juan shoots the other and tells Mason that Mason is a pawn in a bigger game. Someone purposely picked Mason to kill Juan and help ignite the coup. Mason decides to help Juan and Claire escape the jungle alive, stop the coup, and restart Claire's career.<br/><br/>The opening scene is interesting because it gives the audience Mason's life through his eyes. Then, the script gets funny, so you don't take the shooting and killing too seriously. Juan is an intriguing character. He lives his life with the motto, 'Failing to plan is planning to fail.' He is amusingly charming but extremely intelligent. Sadly, the script uses an unnecessary seduction scene to make the respectable reporter nothing more than a typical vixen. The viewers know Mason loves his wife, so rejecting Claire is pointless. Save this movie for streaming on a slow day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sergeant Joshua Taylor lies in bed with his pregnant wife, Maya. They both lost family members in the A.I.-Human war. A.I. soldiers bring Sergeant Drew into Joshua's home. Joshua tells Maya to run upstairs and hide. With Maya out of earshot, Drew and Joshua laugh. Joshua whispers to his handlers to make Drew and the robots leave because they will blow his cover. Joshua hasn't discovered the location of Maya's father, the A.I. creator. Maya overhears the conversation and runs to the ocean. The secret force's sky base scans the area and drops a missile to keep Maya from telling her father. They maim Joshua and kill Maya and their unborn child.<br/><br/>Five years later, Joshua still has nightmares about that day. Joshua enjoys a late-night swim in his pool but comes to the surface when he sees Colonel Howell and General Andrews standing at the edge. They show Joshua evidence that Maya is alive and helping the creator make a new weapon. They want Joshua to find and destroy it. If he does, they will let him leave with Maya.<br/><br/>Joshua finds the weapon after an intense battle and approaches it alone. He puts his gun down when he sees the weapon is a female child sim. Sims are robots with donated human faces. Joshua shows the child a picture of Maya, and the child recognizes her. Joshua can't destroy the child because she can lead him to Maya and the creator. The child escapes with Joshua on her heels. They hide in a shack from Howell and her troops. When a gunshot compromises their location, Joshua finds an abandoned car and puts the child inside. He sees the markings 'Alpha Omega' on her mechanics and names the child Alphie. Joshua looks for the keys but can't find them. Alphie concentrates and starts the car. Alphie is unlike any other sim because sims are carbon copies of adults. Alphie, the first child sim, can grow and learn. Over time, she will grow to control any machine, from anywhere. Joshua is on a mission to find Maya, but Alphie will do much more.<br/><br/>This futuristic look into artificial intelligence is a startling view of today's world. Some humans don't understand what they created, so they fear it. Other humans live in peace with robots and join them to create a new society. For Sci-fi lovers, the twists are predictable. And the sound effects drown out the dialogue. Otherwise, the imagery is stunning, and the acting is superb. The bond between Alphie and Joshua deepens throughout the script and makes the audience hope for a loving solution. While you won't want to buy the movie, you will crave a part two for this soon-to-be cult classic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dumb Money",
    "review":"Keith Gill, a financial broker for MassMutual, meets with his friend, Briggsy, at a bar to discuss their investments. Keith admits that he invested $53,000 into GameStop. Briggsy can't believe it because hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, are shorting the stock. Keith goes home to his wife, Caroline, and baby girl. He posted his ideas on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, but no one listened. Caroline tells him to make another video. Keith walks to his basement, changes his shirt, puts on a red headband, and goes live as Roaring Kitty.<br/><br/>Jenny, a nurse, is a divorced mother of two and follows Wall Street Bets. She listens to Roaring Kitty and buys GameStop stock on the Robinhood app. Marcos works at GameStop and sees it struggling. Marcos decides to put a few dollars into GameStop after watching the stream. RiRi, a college student, has over $100,000 in student loan debt. She invested money into GameStop and encouraged others to do the same. Harmony listens to RiRi, watches Roaring Kitty, and starts to invest while falling for RiRi.<br/><br/>By January, Steve Cohen calls Gabe about GME. He warns Gabe that one person is driving up the buying. Gabe watches a few clips and doubles down on the short sale. Ken Griffin laughs at retail investors and calls them Dumb Money. The hedge fund managers aren't the only people watching GameStop. Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, owners of the Robinhood App, saw the number of users skyrocket. But none of them know that the Apes will expose Robinhood and cause a short squeeze that will spark a media frenzy, social payback, and a congressional hearing.<br/><br/>Based on The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, this movie mixes real-life events with a compilation of stories from retail investors. The plot doesn't describe how to short a stock, what hedge funds are, or what a short squeeze is. Instead, the audience gets to know the man behind Roaring Kitty. He ignited the masses and made investment companies take the Apes seriously. This film has engaging dialogue, great music, and realistic portrayals. It gives you an overview of the players, their jobs, and their net worth. The audience sees how they all fared at the end. They wanted to take down the system but became the product. So, sit back, take notes, and enjoy the social gamification of the market.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The Paw Patrol gets a distress call from the J and H Junkyard. Someone stole their 10-ton magnet and started a fire during the getaway. The pups save Janet and Hank but wonder why someone would steal it. They don't ponder for long because they want to run home to see the meteor shower over Adventure Bay. The crew readies the snacks as Ryder introduces them to The Junior Patrollers, Nano, Tot, and Mini. The meteor is heading toward Adventure Bay. They run to the town, secure everyone, and clear a path. Ryder and the pups go to the crater and find the meteor pulsating. Ryder decides to examine it in his lab.<br/><br/>The news reports that Victoria Vance pulled the meteor to Earth and broadcast her crime on social media. She used the powerful magnet to attract the meteor because something powerful was inside. The police find her post, arrest Victoria, and put her in jail. Her new cellmate is Mayor Humdinger and his cats.<br/><br/>A bright light wakes up Skye, and she walks towards it. She touches the meteor, and it shatters, leaving seven crystals behind. One crystal attaches to her collar, and Sky can fly. Each crystal latches on to them. Rubble becomes a wrecking ball while Chase gets super speed. Zuma can control and become water, while Marshall can shoot fireballs from his paws. And Zuma becomes Magneto. Liberty tries with all her might but doesn't have powers. Adventure Bay marvels at their upgraded heroes and plasters them all over the news. Victoria sees the report and vows to take back the pups' powers. Humdinger offers to help break Victoria out if she shares their abilities. Can the Paw Patrol defeat Victoria and Humdinger before she takes their powers?<br/><br/>Before the movie starts, their is a short music video, a Dora short, and Pup theater etiquette for the kids. This constant change may confuse younger viewers, so parents should be ready to explain. The film is good clean entertainment with lots of action. Also, it provides an origin story for Skye. The graphics and storyline are fun for the entire family. There are jokes for adults, but they are not innuendoes. The movie is comically self-aware and entertains without dumbing down the content or making inappropriate quips over kids' heads. Bring the entire family to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars for kids and 3.5 out of 5 stars for adults.",
