    "mtitle":"Midway",
    "review":"Four years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Isoroku Yamamoto warned Edwin Langston if the U.S. took away oil from the Japanese, they would have no option but to retaliate. These words rang true on December 7th, 1941. After the attack, Pearl Harbor was considered the biggest intelligence failure in U.S. history. With Admiral Chester Nimitz hired to head the U.S. Pacific fleet, Nimitz will do the one thing the government refuses to do, listen to Edwin Langston. He will use the guidance of Edwin Langston and his codebreakers to change the tide of the war, U.S. intelligence, and the world.<br/><br/>The costume design and era props were expertly selected. And it was poignant to have the faces of the real men and their live's conclusion on the screen. However, the spotty CGI ruined the overall effect of the movie. It should still be seen on the big screen to feel the full impact.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Last Christmas",
    "review":"After a life-threatening illness, Katrina is stumbling through life by couch surfing and living out of her suitcase. She works at the Yuletide store - a store that celebrates Christmas all year round. While cleaning figurines, she sees Tom looking up at something. She goes outside to discover he is looking at a rare bird. The bird poops on her face. He laughs while she is disgusted. He offers to take her on a walk but she says no. After a bad audition, she bumps into him and takes an unexpected walk. He only has one rule: Look Up. This walk will redirect her life.<br/><br/>This is a sweet Christmas story with a predictable ending. Once you learn her illness, it is easy to see where the story is going. While the story is compelling, it just doesn't tug at your heartstrings like it is aiming to do. This movie could have been on Lifetime. If you want to see a holiday movie, see this matinee.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
