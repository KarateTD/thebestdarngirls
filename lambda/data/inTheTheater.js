    "review": "Sarah walks to the garage to spend quality time with her husband, Charlie, before her business trip. She will spend five days in London. Charlie works for the CIA in the Decryption and Analysis department. His contacts send him top-secret information. Charlie sees Sarah off before going to work.<br/><br/>Charlie walks to his desk and gets an encrypted message from Inquiline. Inquiline sends Charlie several files. They prove that Charlie's boss, CIA Director Alex Moore, falsifies drone strikes as suicide bombings to hide their political influence. Charlie is unsure what to do with the information and goes home.<br/><br/>Charlie arrives at work and sees colleagues at his desk. Charlie worries as he enters Alex's office. Alex and the CIA Director Samantha O'Brien have distressing news for Charlie. There was a terror attack in London, and a terrorist killed Sarah.<br/><br/>Charlie comes to work the next day and surprises everyone. He researched all night and uncovered the four assailants: Mishka Blazhic, Ellish, Gretchen Frank, and Horst Schiller. Horst, the most elusive, killed Sarah. Charlie shows Alex and CIA Supervisor Caleb, and they are not shocked. Charlie demands field training, cash, and a new identity so he can eliminate Sarah's killers. They tell Charlie to report to Henderson at the training facility. Henderson will prepare Charlie for his tasks, but Alex wants Charlie to become a victim. Can Charlie get his revenge before Alex silences him?<br/><br/>Based on The Amateur: A Novel of Revenge by Robert Littell, this globe-trotting revenge plot pits brain against brawn. Charlie has an affinity for field work but doesn't possess the strength or callousness. However, he uses his skills and knowledge to stay one step ahead. The graphics are gritty but not shocking or overly bloody. The trailers promise a high-octane story. However, the writing contains several lulls and an unnecessary 'will they, won't they' aspect. Viewers should see this picture in theaters, but you won't want to buy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "A U.S. Navy SEAL team enters a home in Ramadi, and translators Farid and Noor secure the family living inside. The team sets up camp in the house and monitors the market across the street for suspicious activity.<br/><br/>In the morning, the team views a lookout on the roof across the street. Then, Ray and Elliot see increased activity and guns but can't get a clear shot. As they report their findings, someone throws a grenade into the window. They call over the radio for a Bradley and wait. The Bradley arrives, and the team sends the translators first. The team joins them, and an I.E.D. detonates. One of the translators is gravely wounded, while Sam and Elliot are severely injured. The team radios for two Bradleys and an extraction team to help Sam and Elliot. It will take 10 minutes. It will be the longest 10 minutes of their life.<br/><br/>Wow! Based on the team's memories, this movie covers a gruesome battle in a warzone. The film feels slow and tedious as this young team carries out their mission. Then, hell comes to them. The graphics department didn't spare any horrific detail. The audience sees blood, guts, and dismemberment. This film should have a trigger warning for anyone with war-related PTSD. You will also see images of some of the team during the end credits. The action makes this movie worth the 'big screen' price, but one viewing is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Minecraft Movie",
    "review": "Steve dreamed of working in the mines, but they won't let children into the dangerous area. Steve grew up and became dissatisfied with his life. Then, he remembered his childhood dream. So, Steve snuck into the mine and found a crystal and an orb. He put the orb into the crystal, and a portal opened to the Overworld. One day, a portal to another dimension opened. Steve and his wolf, Dennis, found a world called Nether. The ruler, Malgosha, had her underlings dig for gold and outlawed creativity. When Steve bonded the orb and crystal, Malgosha saw the beacon. She pulled Steve and Dennis into the Nether. She wants to orb and crystal to access the Overworld and dig for its gold. Steve rubs the orb and crystal under his arm, gives it to Dennis, and tells Dennis to follow his scent to Earth to hide the items. Malgosha keeps Steve in her dungeon until her minions can locate the orb and crystal.<br/><br/>Garrett was the 1989 Hunk City arcade champion. Garrett still acts like a big deal but receives an eviction notice for his store. He attends a storage auction, and the auctioneer hints that an Atari gaming console is in one of the units. Garrett wins the storage unit, but the gaming console is a box with clutter inside, including the orb and crystal. Garrett grabs a few items and drives down the road until his car stalls.<br/><br/>Natalie and her brother, Henry, drive past Garrett. Natalie became Henry's legal guardian after their mother's death. They meet their real estate agent, Dawn, at the house and get their keys. Natalie hopes this will be a new start for both of them.<br/><br/>Henry visits Game Over World before school and meets Garrett. His art teacher tells the students to draw an orange and a banana. Henry draws a banana jet pack with the calculations to make it work. His classmates challenge Henry, and Henry makes it. Before he puts the jet pack on a skeleton, two bullies sabotage it. Henry lights the fuse. The skeleton flies into the potato chip factory and knocks off the mascot. Vice Principal Marlene tells Henry to call his guardian. Henry calls Garrett and pays him to pretend to be his uncle so Natalie won't be angry at him.<br/><br/>Garrett collects Henry and brings him back to the store. Henry looks around and finds the orb and crystal. He puts the two together, and the items guide Henry to the mine. Across town, Natalie panics because Henry is missing. Dawn tells Natalie to use her phone's location feature, and they track Henry to the mine. The portal opens, pulling Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn inside. Henry quickly adjusts to the world, but Malgosha receives the beacon. She tells Steve to get the orb and crystal, or she will kill Dennis.<br/><br/>Steve arrives in the Overworld and saves the group. However, the crystal broke in the battle. Steve tells the group that another crystal is in the Woodland Mansion. He tells them it's their only way home but doesn't alert them to Malgosha's plan. Will the team make it home, or will Malgosha rule the Overworld?<br/><br/>Inspired by the Minecraft video game, this movie allows the imagination to outshine the dialogue. The worlds are beautifully crafted and respectful of the source material. However, don't try to make sense of what you are watching. Just enjoy the ride. You don't need to know about the video game to understand the film. The overall theme of this adventure film is creators versus destroyers. It's a family film for all. And stay for the post-credit scene for a peek at the sequel.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Construction foreman Levon sees some men beating his co-worker. Levon fights the men off, and his boss's daughter, Jenny, sees it. She spots his military training because her grandfather was a Green Beret. Levon asks Jenny to keep his secret from her parents. She agrees.<br/><br/>After the weekend, Levon arrives at work and sees police officers leaving his boss's trailer. His bosses, Joe and Carla Garcia, are in tears. Their daughter, Jenny, went partying with her friends on Friday but never came home. Joe could tell Levon was military by Levon's persona. They give Levon $50,000 to find Jenny and promise another 20 for expenses. Levon will find the people who kidnapped Jenny by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Based on Levon's Trade by Chuck Dixon, this movie follows an unassuming man as he kills everyone. The combat scenes are gritty, bloody, and surprisingly funny. However, some characters and plot points feel unnecessary. The conclusion hints at a franchise because one character lusts for revenge. It's not surprising because this is a 12-book series. The movie has guns, hits, and laughs, but a sequel can go straight to streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Death of A Unicorn",
    "review": "Elliot and his daughter, Ridley, drive to Leopold Wilderness Reserve. He takes his eyes off the road when he loses service and hits an animal. Ridley looks back and sees the animal is alive. She exits the car and sees a white unicorn with purple blood. When Ridley sees the unicorn's horn glow, she touches it and has a vision. The images stop when Elliot beats it to death, splattering the blood on their faces. Elliot puts the unicorn in the car and continues to the Leopold Residence.<br/><br/>Elliot introduces Ridley to the Leopolds. Odell and Belinda are a happily married couple with a son, Shepard. Odell hid his cancer diagnosis from their stakeholders and wanted Elliot to be his proxy. Before the Leopolds sign the contract, they want Elliot and Ridley to stay at their home for the weekend.<br/><br/>Ridley looks out the window and sees the car moving. She tries to warn Elliot, but he's too busy with the Leopolds. She walks into the bathroom, washes her face, and sees that her acne is gone. Soon, the Leopolds see their car moving and inspect it. The unicorn breaks out of the vehicle, and Odell's assistant, Shaw, shoots it. Elliot confesses that his eyesight has improved, and his allergies have disappeared. Ridley wants to turn the creature over to the government, but the Leopolds decide to experiment on it.<br/><br/>Ridley stares at pictures of her deceased mother and sees a tapestry with unicorns. She researches the creatures and discovers their dark origins. She runs to the Leopolds, but the unicorn blood works on Odell. His cancer is gone. They ignore Ridley's pleas as folklore. They will pay the price because mommy and daddy are coming for their baby.<br/><br/>This film is funny enough for horror movie haters but could be too campy for horror lovers. The beginning shows the differences between Ridley and Elliot. His focus is on making money to ensure Ridley's future. Each time the Leopolds dangle money before Elliot, he relents to their demands. The Leopolds are the stereotypical oligarchic family. The Leopolds happily sacrifice their staff to gain the unicorn's powers. The graphics are good enough for the genre but become distracting as they interact with real objects. Also, it makes the slaughter scenes more comical than gory. The script feels preachy but breaks it up with enough laughs to not be political. The film is entertaining, but once is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
