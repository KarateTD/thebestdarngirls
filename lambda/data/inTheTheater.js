    "review":"Real estate lawyer Robert Montague Renfield helped Count Dracula purchase a castle. Renfield hoped the deal will allow him to enter upper society and provide a better life for his family. However, he becomes Dracula's familiar for centuries. While drinking humans makes Dracula stronger, Renfield draws his from bugs.<br/><br/>Renfield attends a Dependent Relationships Addiction Anonymous Group, a.k.a DRAAG, in present-day New Orleans. Renfield never speaks during these meetings but helps the members by killing their abusive partners. After the group, Renfield follows an abusive boyfriend to his lair. He and his friends stole drugs from the most feared crime family in New Orleans, the Lobos. Renfield kills everyone inside as Teddy Lobo brings a hired assassin to get payback for the theft. Renfield beheads the hired gun, and Teddy flees the scene with kilos of drugs in his car. Teddy drives to a DUI checkpoint and sees Officer Rebecca Quincy working. Frustrated with her department's unwillingness to help, Rebecca returns to the scene and finds a pen with a restaurant logo. She goes to the restaurant to see if Teddy is there committing a crime.<br/><br/>Teddy's mother, Bella, has grown tired of Teddy's antics. She doesn't believe he has what it takes to lead the family. She wants Teddy to kill Rebecca and demonstrate that he can run the Lobos.<br/><br/>Renfield brings his latest kill to Dracula, who is still healing from an attack, but Dracula is unhappy. The blood isn't innocent and pure. Then Renfields sees Dracula's plan for world domination. Renfield goes to his favorite restaurant and prays for relief as each of Dracula's requests enters, including Rebecca. Renfield walks to the door to leave but sees Teddy and his henchman running toward the entrance with guns. Renfield hides with the other patrons, and Teddy puts a gun to Rebecca's head. Rebecca's courage inspires Renfield. He eats a bug and helps Rebecca take down Teddy's gang. Renfield runs to the group and begs for guidance. He needs to focus on himself. Dracula won't let Renfield leave without a fight and will destroy everything Renfield cares about, including Rebecca, to make Renfield return and suffer.<br/><br/>Based on vampire lore, this movie is funny and gory. The movie's core is surviving unhealthy relationships. Like most abusive relationships, Dracula retaliates when Renfield attempts to leave. He attacks Renfield's self-esteem and friends. Outside the plot, this film has fun, bloody fight scenes. Don't be fooled. Rebecca doesn't sit around screaming for help. She kills and fights her way out of situations. This new twist on a classic has something for everyone. This movie is for the M3GAN and Cocaine Bear fans.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sonny Vaccaro looks through game tapes to find the next athletic sponsor for Nike. The CEO, Phil Knight, authorized $250,000 for three players. Sonny has plenty on his shoulders because Nike's basketball division is floundering. Sonny sits in a marketing meeting with its head, Rob Strasser, and looks through the 1984 NBA draft picks. Sonny wants them to consider Michael Jordan, but the staff knows Jordan is expensive and prefers Adidas. Sonny leaves the meeting upset and looks over more college basketball tapes. While watching, he sees an Arthur Ashe commercial for tennis rackets and gets an idea. Instead of having a player put on their shoes, they design them for the player. The player and the shoe will become a brand within themselves.<br/><br/>Sonny flies to LA to talk to his friend, George Raveling, because George coached Michael Jordan in the Olympic tournament. George believes Sonny's instincts are right about the rookie but warns Sonny that Michael's parents, James and Deloris, are strongholds in their son's career. Sonny returns to Nike's headquarters and pitches his idea to Howard White. Howard signed Moses Malone to a Nike deal that remains their best acquisition. Howard admits he called Moses's mom to finalize the deal. Sonny takes George and Howard's advice and meets with Jordan's parents. After a revealing conversation with Deloris, Jordan's manager, David, calls Sonny with a flurry of insults and a Monday meeting. Sonny runs to Peter Moore and asks him to design the best shoe Nike has ever created. Sonny doesn't know, but his decision to pursue Michael Jordan will change Nike, athletic sponsorships, and Michael Jordan's finances forever.<br/><br/>A lot of care went into making this film. The director ensures this isn't a Michael Jordan movie. It's about Sonny, Deloris, and Nike. Sonny is the man behind the curtain. He understood the psychology behind the sport, its players, and its coaches. However, the driving force behind this deal was Deloris Jordan. She knew her son's worth to the game and wouldn't compromise his future. The music and technology will transport you back to 1984. Also, this film gives recognition to Peter's genius. Sneakers weren't just a fashion statement for him. They were a work of art. While the language is a bit much for younger viewers, audiences will love this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"John Wick: Chapter 4",
    "review":"John trains as the Bowery King brings him a new suit. After hiding underground, John travels to Morocco to meet the new Elder of the High Table. John asks the Elder for his ring and freedom. The Elder tells John the wedding ring is long gone with the previous Elder. And they won't free John either. John stands and shoots the Elder in the head.<br/><br/>Marquis Vincent de Gramont visits the New York Continental Hotel. He strips Winston of his title and condemns the hotel because Winston didn't kill John. And he wants to put an end to John Wick. It starts with New York. Vincent will make every city respect the High Table by demolishing John's flagship hotel. Vincent pulls out his gun and kills Charon. Charon is Winston's consequence for deceiving the High Table.<br/><br/>Vincent leaves New York and travels to Paris. He summons Caine, John's friend and a retired assassin for the High Table, for a meeting. Vincent gives Caine a card with his mark's name: John Wick. Caine sighs and agrees.<br/><br/>John runs to the Osaka Continental to meet with the manager, Koji, against the wishes of his concierge, Akira. No one sees Tracker in the lobby with a notebook full of information about John Wick. The bounty of $15,000,000 isn't enough for Tracker, but he will keep an eye on John while it rises. John tells Koji that he plans to kill every member of the High Table. Koji warns John that John's path will only lead to more killing and destruction.<br/><br/>John meets with Winston, who agrees with Koji, to offer condolences for the Continental and Charon. Winston offers John a better idea. Winston tells John to request a duel against Vincent. According to legend, a family must sponsor him in the duel, and he tore his ticket to gain passage. John needs to find a new family, obtain a ticket, request a duel, and kill Marquis Vincent de Gramont to free himself of the High Table for good.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of John Wick packs more plot than its predecessors but maintains all the action. The battles were well-timed, in sync with the music, and innovative. If you haven't seen the previous three films, watch them before watching this film. The movie doesn't take the time to catch viewers up on what happened and why. This film is funnier and wiser than the first three films. Don't worry, because this film has a lot of blood, guns, axes, and nunchucks. So it has all the cringe-inducing violence you love. The downside to this film is the unrealistic survival. Viewers could believe one man could live through these battles, but a 50-foot drop onto the pavement is too far for any stretch of your imagination. This movie is a fitting conclusion for John Wick fans with new characters and locations. Also, it has one post-credit scene at the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
