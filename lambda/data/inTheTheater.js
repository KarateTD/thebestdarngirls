    "review": "Sarah Rector was free and a descendant of Creek Natives. After the Treaty of 1866, she was in a unique position to acquire 160 acres of land at the age of 11. Sarah walked into the office and signed her name proudly. Her parents, Rose and Joseph, want to sell her land because they can't pay the $30 property tax. However, Sarah has other plans. She convinces her father to ask local oil companies to drill on her land. He relents.<br/><br/>Joseph approaches several oil companies, but most won't let him walk into the front door. He asks Sarah to wait outside while he speaks to Devnan at Pan Oklahoma Petroleum. Sarah walks into Busy Bee Café and asks for water. However, the waitress points to the whites only sign. Then, Bert Smith offers to buy Sarah a lemonade. Sarah thanks Bert before leaving. She storms into Devnan's office and demands a deal. He will rent the land for six months. If he finds oil, he will give Sarah royalties. She agrees.<br/><br/>After three months, Devnan says the well is dry and wants to end their deal. Later that night, someone tries to buy it from Sarah, but she says no. Sarah marches to a day worker area and spots Bert. She asks him to help her drill on the land. Sarah believes Devnan lied when he said it was dry and that the buyer was working for him. Bert surveys the area and discovers that Devnan set up oil drills around Sarah's property. He knows she has oil and barrels of it. They become partners and start drilling. Sarah has a target on her back. Can she keep what's hers?<br/><br/>Sarah is a no-nonsense individual with strong faith and a solid educational background. This film, based on a true story, covers Jim Crow Laws, twisted guardianship, and the murders of indigenous child landowners. It covers the history without the gory details. The writers explain the law in a way that young tweens can understand. The script injects humor to keep the story jovial. This film tackles a sensitive history with a light touch, and it entertains with humor and faith.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Die My Love",
    "review": "Jackson and Grace move from New York to live in the home of Jackson's recently deceased uncle in Montana. While Jackson works on the road, Grace will stay home and write her novel. Soon, Grace is pregnant with their first baby. But Jackson's mother, Pam, can see the 1000-yard stare in her eyes. Pam reassures Grace that fear, confusion, and sadness are common during pregnancy. Jackson and Grace aren't prepared for the changes she will go through after she gives birth. It will have a lasting effect on their marriage.<br/><br/>The beginning shot fills the screen and envelops the audience in fire. Once Jackson and Grace move in, the black bars appear on the side, giving the audience the boxed-in feel. You can feel the isolation and despair. But that's where it ends. The director has stepped so far into artistry that the film becomes disjointed and confusing. You will leave the theater wondering what happened, what you watched, and why you were supposed to care. The film gets lost in flashy imagery with no substance, like Mother!. See this film if you are into symbolism.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Regretting You",
    "review": "Seventeen years ago, Jonah drove to a gas station with his girlfriend, Jenny, his best friend, Chris, and Chris's girlfriend, Morgan, to get alcohol. Morgan stealthily acquired a pregnancy test and headed to the bathroom. At the beach, Chris tries to get Morgan to drink, but she refuses. Jenny and Chris leave Morgan and Jonah to play beer pong. Then, Morgan confesses to Jonah that she's pregnant.<br/><br/>Today, Chris and Morgan are married and have a daughter named Clara. Jonah left town for college and never looked back until a year ago. He met up with Jenny, had a one-night stand, and she got pregnant. Now, they have a baby boy named Elijah. Clara calls Jenny and asks her to keep a secret. Jenny promises, but puts the phone on speaker so Morgan can hear. Clara spent the evening with the cutest boy in school, Miller, and gave him a ride home. However, Clara discovered that Miller has a girlfriend, Shelby. Jenny warns her to stay away from him. Clara relents.<br/><br/>Jenny's maternity leave is over, and Morgan will watch Elijah for her. Clara pulls Jenny aside for more boy advice. She warns Clara to be careful around Miller. Chris honks so Clara can move her car. Clara picks up her friend, Lexie, and drives to school. Lexie heard a rumor that Miller broke up with Shelby after Shelby accused him of cheating on her with Clara. Clara lets her fantasies wander until he gives her the cold shoulder. She texts Jenny for clarity. Jenny warns Clara not to be the 'other girl' and to 'trust her' about the situation. Clara asks if Jenny was the other girl and starts text-bombing her for details. Jenny never replies.<br/><br/>Morgan receives a call from the hospital that Chris was in an accident. She runs to his job, and Jonah rushes in behind her. He received a similar call about Jenny. They discovered that Jenny and Chris were in the same car and that he was driving. Sadly, they passed away. Something plagues Jonah. He doesn't know why they were together. Jonah starts to say a hurtful truth, but Morgan won't let him for Clara's sake. However, the secrets could destroy her faster. Will the truth come out?<br/><br/>Based on Regretting You by Colleen Hoover, this film intimately portrays loss, love, and betrayal. However, it isn't the tear-jerker the audience expects. The script inserts enough humor and love to break apart the sadness. And Lexie has perfect comedic timing, inflection, and pacing. The actress dominates every scene she's in. The movie's pace is steady, and every character has a proper conclusion. It's not appropriate for tweens, but better suited for older teens. Audiences should give this film a chance at the matinee unless they are sticklers for book accuracy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

This movie starts like It's a Wonderful Life, but becomes much more. The theme is for the modern-day audience and touches the soul. The edits aren't smooth, but it doesn't distract from the message.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Roofman",
    "review": "The military discharged Jeff, and he lost his family after consistently breaking promises. During a custody exchange on his daughter's birthday, Jeff notices the inner workings of a local McDonald's. He wonders how many he would have to rob to get his family back. The answer was 45.<br/><br/>A year later, Jeff bought a home, and his family, wife, daughter, and twin boys, live with him. He hosts a birthday party for his daughter, Becky, but can't stop watching the news about the latest Roofman robbery. When a sketch appears on the screen, Jeff's friend, Steve, notices the similarities. Jeff opens the door to a slew of police officers. They arrest him, and the judge gives him 45 years in jail.<br/><br/>Jeff notices the inner workings of the prison and plans his escape by being helpful, kind, and quiet. He hides under a truck while it leaves the prison. Jeff contacts Steve, but Steve needs a month to get the documents. Steve tells Jeff to find a place to lay low. Jeff sees the Toys 'R Us across the street. Jeff makes himself at home.<br/><br/>One month later, Jeff calls Steve, but Steve signed up for a 6-month tour of duty. Jeff has to stay hidden until then. During his surveillance, Jeff learns passwords, more about the employees, and their unwavering boss, Mitch. Mitch relies heavily on Leigh. She is a divorced mom of two who loves church. Jeff steals toys from the store for the drive after hearing Mitch reject Leigh's toy requests. Later, the pastor's wife invites Jeff to a singles brunch.<br/><br/>Jeff arrives at the brunch and is the only man in attendance. He charms all the women but concentrates on Leigh. Over the next six months, Jeff will be the man he never thought he could be. Can Jeff go undetected without getting caught? And will he be able to leave it all behind when Steve comes home?<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie is both funny and charming, with a provocative edge. It's easy to look at Jeff as a folk hero, like Robinhood. The main character acknowledges his shortcomings in the opening sequence. He is an intelligent man who makes dumb choices. The set design department worked overtime recreating the store and hideaway. The designers incorporated the technology, music, and trends of the period. The director used natural lighting and practical sets to make the movie more authentic. This movie is reminiscent of Catch Me If You Can, but once is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
