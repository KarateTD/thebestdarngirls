    "review":"Coriolanus Snow dresses his best to hide his family's loss of wealth and prepare for the Plinth Prize. The scholarship will guarantee his place at Capital University and prosperity for his family. Snow's classmates think he is a shoo-in because Snow is at the top of the class, but Snow thinks Dean Casca Highbottom despises him. They decided to change the requirements for the prize. It will no longer go to the student with the best grade. However, the students will become mentors to contestants in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. The mentor with the winning contestant will win the prize. Snow curses when he gets the female from District 12.<br/><br/>For District 12, Lucy Gray Baird hears her name and walks to the podium in her finest dress. She stands up, straightens her dress, and sings a song of rebellion. The audience loves her.<br/><br/>Several of the students think the games are antiquated. The Head Gamemaster, Dr. Volumnia Gaul, asks them to write a paper to make the game more intriguing. She will implement the best paper in these Hunger Games. Snow waits for Lucy Gray to disembark the train and greets her with a flower. She tells Snow that gifts aren't enough. He has to believe in her. The car drops the contestants into the Capital Zoo so spectators can watch them before they die in the arena. Snow pledges to do the impossible, but Lucy Gray must play her part. She needs to captivate the audience. Snow will fall, settle, and rise.<br/><br/>Based on The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins, this film covers the rise of Coriolanus Snow. From humbled student to gamemaster, Snow was always cunning. The games didn't change him; they amplified his authentic nature. This film calls back Katniss, Mockingjays, Jabberjays, and The Hanging Tree song for Hunger Games fanatics. Viewers assume the end of the game concludes the story, but it's only the middle. The story has three parts: The Mentor, The Prize, and The Peacekeeper. This change causes the story to drag, but it's worth the matinee price on the big screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Trolls Band Together",
    "review":"Poppy creates Bridget's perfect wedding dress and beams as Bridget's maid of honor. As the pastor asks the crowd for objections, John Dory yells from the crowd. John Dory is Branch's older brother. Poppy stares in shock because she never knew Branch had a brother. John reveals Branch has four brothers: himself, Spruce, Clay, and Floyd. They made up the group BroZone. The group broke up after they failed to hit the Perfect Family Harmony. The four members left the baby, Branch, to care for their grandmother. John needs Branch's help because the pop duo Velvet and Veneer trapped Floyd inside a diamond perfume bottle. Anytime they need talent, they spray themselves with Floyd. However, each application brings Floyd closer to death. Branch recalls that the Perfect Family Harmony can break diamonds. John wants to get the band back together to sing the harmony and free Floyd before Velvet and Veneer kill him.<br/><br/>The third installment of the Trolls franchise has the catchy boy band mashup spanning five eras of music. Kids, parents, and grandparents will dance in their seats to tunes that define the boy band craze for them. Based on Good Luck Trolls dolls, this movie packs jokes for kids while slipping in innuendos for parents. With the catchy music and quick wit, something is missing from this Trolls movie. The other films brought raw emotion to the surface for the viewers and made a statement about music. This story fell flat on both aspects. This film brings back old favorites and delves deeper into Branch's story. However, it doesn't resonate like the other films.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Next Goal Wins",
    "review":"Soccer coach Thomas Rongen sits in front of the American Soccer Federation to explain himself and what he brings to the organization. If he coaches a team of their choosing, he can keep his job. He must coach American Samoa. They lost to Australia 31-0 in 2001. Since then, the team hasn't scored a goal and has been at the bottom of the ranks. Thomas begrudgingly agrees to coach them.<br/><br/>Thomas lands on the island, and a camera crew greets him. The cameraman is the team's president, Tavita. Tavita doesn't care if the team wins or loses under Thomas. He wants the team to score 1 goal in the qualifier in four weeks. Only one is a success for Tavita. Can Thomas turn the team around?<br/><br/>Based on the documentary Next Goal Wins, this movie is delightful in its storytelling. A priest introduces the team, the culture, and Thomas to the audience. Tavita had a heatstroke during the qualifying match. So, his son had to give him a play-by-play of the game. Also, Thomas is overcoming loss. He turned that pain into rage and lost his job. He learns from the culture to choose happiness. This film is a feel-good triumph that will make you cheer. However, one viewing is all you need.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Priscilla",
    "review":"Priscilla Beaulieu sits at a German malt shop studying as Officer Terry West asks her if she is a fan of Elvis Presley. Terry books the music acts on base and considers Elvis a friend. He invites Priscilla to his home to meet the singer. Priscilla warns Terry to check with her father, Captain Beaulieu, before she can go.<br/><br/>Captain Beaulieu and Ann both say no. Officer Terry approaches the family when they go out to dinner. He convinces the Captain and Ann to let Priscilla go for a night out. Elvis sits next to her and inquires about her age. Priscilla is in the 9th grade, and Elvis is 23-years-old. They continue talking and meeting for months until Elvis gets his orders to return to the States. Elvis called her in 1961. He is ready for Priscilla to visit him at Graceland.<br/><br/>Elvis introduces Priscilla to his family and friends. Priscilla is excited to see him again and can't sleep. So, Elvis gives her a pill to calm her. Then, he invites her on a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas. With the pills to help, they party and gamble all night. Priscilla begs to stay, but Elvis knows she must return to Germany.<br/><br/>Captain Beaulieu and Ann barely recognize their daughter when she disembarks the plane. However, Priscilla will do anything to be with the man she loves. Elvis calls the Captain with an offer. He will care for Priscilla and ensure she finishes her high school education. Priscilla believes this is the beginning of a new, exciting life with the most loving man in the world. Instead, she moves into a golden cage of control, manipulation, and affairs.<br/><br/>Based on Elvis and Me by Priscilla Presley, this movie is a lesson on red flags. Priscilla states they were not physical until marriage. However, Elvis told her what to wear and where to go and picked her friends. Priscilla didn't understand that his care was control. The film has several montages of Priscilla being bored. Unfortunately, it has the same effect on the audience. The costumes and iconic images are spot-on recreations, but it's not enough for viewers to see it in theaters. Save this one for streaming.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, Dar-Benn watched The Annihilator tear down the Supreme Intelligence to free the Kree. However, the Kree broke into a civil war and destroyed their air, water, and sun. Supremor Dar-Benn finds one of the Universal Bands, but the other is missing. She uses her Universal Weapon to charge the Band and rips open a jump point through space.<br/><br/>Nick Fury watches Monica Rambeau fix satellites from the SABER space station. He calls Carol Danvers after getting an anomaly alert from sector MB-814. He asks Carol to check things out. Carol flies to MB-814 and finds an open jump point with a strange hue. She walks towards it and touches the swirling light.<br/><br/>Monica Rambeau notices a strange glow around the earth's atmosphere as she works on the satellite. Monica floats to the atmosphere to get a better look. She activates her powers and sees a new light spectrum. She reaches out to touch it, and it wraps around her fingers.<br/><br/>Kamala Khan can't focus on her homework because her head is in the clouds. She writes Captain Marvel fan fiction and dreams of meeting her hero. Then, she sees her bangle glowing. She reaches to touch it. Carol ends up in Kamala's place, Kamala switches with Monica, and Monica ends up on MB-814. Dar-Benn's disruption of the jump points caused a quantum entanglement. It's better to stay together until they can stabilize their swaps.<br/><br/>Kamala joins Carol and Monica on Carol's ship. Dar-Benn's first target is Tarnax, a Skrull refugee colony. Dar-Benn plans to create a jump point that's large enough to steal Tarnax's atmosphere for Hala and reestablish their air supply. Kamala, Carol, and Monica get to Tarnax but can't stop Dar-Benn. Carol admits that she is The Annihilator, and Dar-Benn will destroy every place Carol calls home to save Hala and get revenge. Can The Marvels stop her before Dar-Benn ends two more planets?<br/><br/>This film is a pure superhero team-up movie. If that plot bores you, then this film isn't for you. Monica and Carol have unfinished business from her childhood. Kamala learns that being a superhero requires making difficult decisions and sacrifices. When Carol gets heavy-handed with Kamala, Monica ensures they take a breath and listen to each other. It helps to watch Captain Marvel, Avengers: Infinity Wars, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel.<br/><br/>This movie has wall-to-wall action with poignant and funny moments to break up the script. Kamala's family, Goose, and Nick Fury will never fail to deliver. However, this movie heavily focuses on the action to drive the story. It's an enjoyable movie with Flerkens, fighting, dancing, and a princess that delivers what you expect with a few future nuggets.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
