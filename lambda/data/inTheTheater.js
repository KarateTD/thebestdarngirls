    "review": "Guitarist Sammie leaves the cotton fields for home and searches for his guitar. Pastor Jebediah admits to taking it. He fears evil will prey on his son if Sammie continues to play the devil's music. Sammie won't let Jebediah's worries deter him. He takes his guitar and exits the church. His cousins, twins Elijah 'Smoke' and Elias 'Stack' Moore, wait for him.<br/><br/>Everyone in Clarksdale, Mississippi, knows the Smokestack Twins are not to be trifled with. They fought in World War 1 and worked with mobsters in Chicago. They recently bought a sawmill and will turn it into a juke joint tonight. Smoke and Stack want Sammie to play at their establishment.<br/><br/>The crowd gathers at the juke joint for fun, singing, and dancing. Soon, Stack gets word that his ex-girlfriend, Mary, is in attendance. Stack tells her to leave, but Mary refuses.<br/><br/>During the performances, three people approach the juke joint. Remmick, Bert, and Joan heard Sammie's performance and wanted to play. However, the twins don't believe they will be comfortable and could cause trouble, so they don't invite the trio inside. Mary discovers the twins haven't made enough money and wants to meet the trio to determine trustworthiness. The juke joint is about to dance with the devil. Will they survive?<br/><br/>This movie turns the overworked vampire genre into something special with the 1930s backdrop and spectacular score. The film opens with a brief introduction to a shared folklore. There's music so enchanting that it can pierce the veil between the past and future, the living and the dead, and invite evil. As the tune plays, the director adds past and present music styles along with different types of dancers. It makes the opening sequence come to life and transports you into the world in between. Also, the scenes with the twins interacting are nearly flawless, but the blood scenes are a bit over the top. This movie is captivating, educational, and a tad scary. However, stay for the mid and post-credit scenes. The director, writers, and composers made this film for the big screen.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Yelena completes another mission for CIA Director Valentina but doesn't feel fulfilled. So, she visits her father, Alexei, the Red Guardian, for help. He tells her the best way to feel fulfilled is to do good for her country. Yelena leaves Alexi and calls Valentina. She agrees to do one more job and then become a public figure. Valentina tells Yelana to go to an Ox Corp black site and destroy everything inside, including a target.<br/><br/>Valentina stands before Congress for her impeachment trial. She warns them that the Avengers are gone. They must create new heroes to protect the Earth. Valentina leaves the hearing with her assistant, Mel. She tells Mel to clean everything they can use against her in the hearing.<br/><br/>Congressman Bucky Barnes attends a Battle of New York exhibit with Valentina and Congressman Gary. Bucky runs into Mel and gives her his business card. Then, Bucky pulls Gary aside. He tells Gary that Mel may switch sides. However, Gary wants Bucky to focus on his job.<br/><br/>Yelena arrives at the black site. Then, John Walker hits her. She retaliates but stops because he is not her target. However, she is his. During their battle, Ava, the Ghost, appears and attacks John because Valentina hired her to kill him. They battle, and Taskmaster appears. Ava kills Taskmaster in the battle. The remaining three continue to fight and accidentally hit a button on a box. The box opens and releases Bob. Ava, John, and Yelena argue until they realize that Valentina set them up to kill each other and wipe her slate clean.<br/><br/>Mel second-guesses Valentina's leadership when Valentina instructs Mel to kill her operatives. However, Mel alerts Valentina that they survived and released Bob. She demands that Mel get her to the site and save Bob, but everyone else can die. Valentina and Mel don't know that Alexei is their driver. He drops them off and rushes to warn Yelena. Mel calls Bucky and gives him the details. He rushes to find the three and brings them to the hearing as evidence of Valentina's crimes. Yelena, Bucky, Red Guardian, Ava, and John Walker will form the Thunderbolts. They assume their enemy is Yelena. However, they will battle the void inside all of them.<br/><br/>Marvel fans, you asked for a more story-driven and gritty MCU. This movie delivers. The opening sequence changed. It only includes pages from the comic books. Then, the music and image go dark. Most of the audience has experienced feelings of loneliness, nothingness, sadness, shame, and even depression. This film is the physical manifestation of that. The film's quips are original, funny, and perfectly acted and timed. The only downfall is the first battle scene between Bob and the Thunderbolts. It's reminiscent of Hulk and Loki. It's cartoonish and overly computerized at a time of seriousness. If this is the new direction of the MCU, then they need to stay on this path. Viewers should remain for the mid and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Sarah walks to the garage to spend quality time with her husband, Charlie, before her business trip. She will spend five days in London. Charlie works for the CIA in the Decryption and Analysis department. His contacts send him top-secret information. Charlie sees Sarah off before going to work.<br/><br/>Charlie walks to his desk and gets an encrypted message from Inquiline. Inquiline sends Charlie several files. They prove that Charlie's boss, CIA Director Alex Moore, falsifies drone strikes as suicide bombings to hide their political influence. Charlie is unsure what to do with the information and goes home.<br/><br/>Charlie arrives at work and sees colleagues at his desk. Charlie worries as he enters Alex's office. Alex and the CIA Director Samantha O'Brien have distressing news for Charlie. There was a terror attack in London, and a terrorist killed Sarah.<br/><br/>Charlie comes to work the next day and surprises everyone. He researched all night and uncovered the four assailants: Mishka Blazhic, Ellish, Gretchen Frank, and Horst Schiller. Horst, the most elusive, killed Sarah. Charlie shows Alex and CIA Supervisor Caleb, and they are not shocked. Charlie demands field training, cash, and a new identity so he can eliminate Sarah's killers. They tell Charlie to report to Henderson at the training facility. Henderson will prepare Charlie for his tasks, but Alex wants Charlie to become a victim. Can Charlie get his revenge before Alex silences him?<br/><br/>Based on The Amateur: A Novel of Revenge by Robert Littell, this globe-trotting revenge plot pits brain against brawn. Charlie has an affinity for field work but doesn't possess the strength or callousness. However, he uses his skills and knowledge to stay one step ahead. The graphics are gritty but not shocking or overly bloody. The trailers promise a high-octane story. However, the writing contains several lulls and an unnecessary 'will they, won't they' aspect. Viewers should see this picture in theaters, but you won't want to buy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "A U.S. Navy SEAL team enters a home in Ramadi, and translators Farid and Noor secure the family living inside. The team sets up camp in the house and monitors the market across the street for suspicious activity.<br/><br/>In the morning, the team views a lookout on the roof across the street. Then, Ray and Elliot see increased activity and guns but can't get a clear shot. As they report their findings, someone throws a grenade into the window. They call over the radio for a Bradley and wait. The Bradley arrives, and the team sends the translators first. The team joins them, and an I.E.D. detonates. One of the translators is gravely wounded, while Sam and Elliot are severely injured. The team radios for two Bradleys and an extraction team to help Sam and Elliot. It will take 10 minutes. It will be the longest 10 minutes of their life.<br/><br/>Wow! Based on the team's memories, this movie covers a gruesome battle in a warzone. The film feels slow and tedious as this young team carries out their mission. Then, hell comes to them. The graphics department didn't spare any horrific detail. The audience sees blood, guts, and dismemberment. This film should have a trigger warning for anyone with war-related PTSD. You will also see images of some of the team during the end credits. The action makes this movie worth the 'big screen' price, but one viewing is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Steve dreamed of working in the mines, but they won't let children into the dangerous area. Steve grew up and became dissatisfied with his life. Then, he remembered his childhood dream. So, Steve snuck into the mine and found a crystal and an orb. He put the orb into the crystal, and a portal opened to the Overworld. One day, a portal to another dimension opened. Steve and his wolf, Dennis, found a world called Nether. The ruler, Malgosha, had her underlings dig for gold and outlawed creativity. When Steve bonded the orb and crystal, Malgosha saw the beacon. She pulled Steve and Dennis into the Nether. She wants to orb and crystal to access the Overworld and dig for its gold. Steve rubs the orb and crystal under his arm, gives it to Dennis, and tells Dennis to follow his scent to Earth to hide the items. Malgosha keeps Steve in her dungeon until her minions can locate the orb and crystal.<br/><br/>Garrett was the 1989 Hunk City arcade champion. Garrett still acts like a big deal but receives an eviction notice for his store. He attends a storage auction, and the auctioneer hints that an Atari gaming console is in one of the units. Garrett wins the storage unit, but the gaming console is a box with clutter inside, including the orb and crystal. Garrett grabs a few items and drives down the road until his car stalls.<br/><br/>Natalie and her brother, Henry, drive past Garrett. Natalie became Henry's legal guardian after their mother's death. They meet their real estate agent, Dawn, at the house and get their keys. Natalie hopes this will be a new start for both of them.<br/><br/>Henry visits Game Over World before school and meets Garrett. His art teacher tells the students to draw an orange and a banana. Henry draws a banana jet pack with the calculations to make it work. His classmates challenge Henry, and Henry makes it. Before he puts the jet pack on a skeleton, two bullies sabotage it. Henry lights the fuse. The skeleton flies into the potato chip factory and knocks off the mascot. Vice Principal Marlene tells Henry to call his guardian. Henry calls Garrett and pays him to pretend to be his uncle so Natalie won't be angry at him.<br/><br/>Garrett collects Henry and brings him back to the store. Henry looks around and finds the orb and crystal. He puts the two together, and the items guide Henry to the mine. Across town, Natalie panics because Henry is missing. Dawn tells Natalie to use her phone's location feature, and they track Henry to the mine. The portal opens, pulling Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn inside. Henry quickly adjusts to the world, but Malgosha receives the beacon. She tells Steve to get the orb and crystal, or she will kill Dennis.<br/><br/>Steve arrives in the Overworld and saves the group. However, the crystal broke in the battle. Steve tells the group that another crystal is in the Woodland Mansion. He tells them it's their only way home but doesn't alert them to Malgosha's plan. Will the team make it home, or will Malgosha rule the Overworld?<br/><br/>Inspired by the Minecraft video game, this movie allows the imagination to outshine the dialogue. The worlds are beautifully crafted and respectful of the source material. However, don't try to make sense of what you are watching. Just enjoy the ride. You don't need to know about the video game to understand the film. The overall theme of this adventure film is creators versus destroyers. It's a family film for all. And stay for the post-credit scene for a peek at the sequel.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
