    "review": "IMF agent Ethan Hunt sits in a private bunker when he gets a VHS tape directly from President Erika Sloane. Since Ethan did not return the cruciform key in his last mission, the Entity has roamed free on the internet. Without intervention, it will have the world's deadliest forces under its control. The world has two choices. They can become a slave to the Entity or shut down the internet. However, the latter would ensure worldwide chaos. President Sloane gently demands that Ethan turn himself and the key over to her.<br/><br/>With Paris's tip, Ethan and Grace travel to London to find Gabriel. Gabriel gets the drop on them, and they wake up bound. Gabriel admits that the Rabbit's Foot wasn't a biological weapon. It was a device that could give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape and meet with Luther and Benji. Luther hands Ethan a device with malware. If Ethan attaches the device to the Entity's source code, it will infect the Entity, and they can trap it.<br/><br/>Paris takes Ethan to a capsule that Gabriel used to communicate with the Entity. Ethan lets the Entity into his mind, and it discovers a plan of attack. However, Ethan sees the plan too. The Entity plans to escape to the Doomsday Vault in South Africa.<br/><br/>Ethan finally falls in line and turns himself over to the President. However, he urges President Sloane not to arrest him because the Entity knows Ethan is the only one with the power to stop it. She writes a note, seals it, grabs the key, and slips it to the guard. She demands that the guards take Ethan to his cell. The guards take him to an awaiting helicopter and give him the key and the note. Now, Ethan must find the location of the source code, retrieve it, and capture the Entity in South Africa. If not, the Entity will fire the world's nuclear weapons. Can Ethan move in the shadows one more time and save the world?<br/><br/>This eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers a heart-pounding thrill ride with unthinkable missions, setbacks, heartbreak, and breathtaking action. The stunts and graphics are smooth and don't distract from the plot. The film doesn't rely heavily on humor because it focuses on the emotional aspect. It does use a similar setup for two scenes. However, they don't feel redundant. Unlike other films, this picture has three nerve-racking moments running simultaneously. Don't be surprised if you hold your breath. It is one of the best Mission: Impossible films of the series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The Grand Councilwoman called an emergency meeting of the United Galactic Federation. Scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba created an alien he calls Experiment 626. It's bright, indestructible, and can evade capture. Councilwoman imprisons 626. 626 escapes before the Councilwoman makes it to the ship's deck. He lands in Honolulu, Hawaii. She plans to vaporize the planet until Agent Wendell Pleakley stops her. Earth is a habitat for the endangered mosquito species. Grand Councilwoman tells Wendell and Dr. Jumba to travel to Earth and capture 626 before he wreaks havoc on the planet.<br/><br/>Lilo arrives at her hula recital late and jumps in place. Another dancer, Myrtle, teases Lilo during the performance, so Lilo pushes Myrtle off the stage. When Nani arrives, Lilo is gone. Nani rushes home to apologize, but Lilo locks Nani outside. Nani grabs a brick to break a window when their caseworker, Mrs. Kekoa, arrives. She gives Nani three tasks to complete in four days, or Nani will lose custody. Lilo agrees to be better. Then she sees a shooting star. She pushes Nani out the door and wishes for a best friend.<br/><br/>Lilo's shooting star was 626's crash landing. Unfortunately, 626 runs into oncoming traffic. Then, a tour bus knocks him out. The driver assumes 626 is a dog and brings it to the animal shelter. Soon after 626's arrival, Dr. Jumba and Agent Wendell enter Earth's atmosphere. And CIA Agent Cobra Bubbles searches the woods to discover who or what left a crater.<br/><br/>Nani's neighbor, Tūtū, takes Lilo to the animal shelter. Lilo plays with the dogs and finds a cage with bent wires. She looks around, and a blue dog says hi to her. Lilo believes her shooting star wish worked. Lilo's latest friend will turn her world upside down and test Lilo's understanding of Ohana.<br/><br/>This live-action remake uses the original as its foundation but adds believable aspects to the film. Fans of the original can spot the differences. These changes don't feel like much. However, it changes the direction of the story. The plot centers around Ohana, but the conclusion is more realistic. The graphics between Stitch and the other animated characters are vivid, life-like, and true to the original. Also, the designers took a lot of time perfecting the moments between Stitch and Lilo. However, Stitch's interactions with other humans can be disjointed and bothersome. Disney adaptations have been hit-and-miss in the past, but this film is a gold standard.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Stefani awakens in the middle of class with a scream. For two months, she has had the same nightmare about her grandparents, Iris and Paul, every day. Stefani believes returning home and speaking to her father, Marty, about Iris will ease her mind. Her roommate agrees.<br/><br/>Stefani arrives home and greets Marty and her brother, Charlie. Stefani asks her father about a box of Iris's things that her mother, Darlene, kept. Marty tells Stefani not to talk about Iris and that the box is with Stefani's uncle Harold. Charlie wants to visit his cousins, so Stefani offers to drive.<br/><br/>They arrive at Harold's home and greet their aunt, Brenda, and cousins, Erik, Bobby, and Julia. Stefani questions Harold about Iris. He says that Iris is a crazy woman, and Child Protective Services had to save him and his sister, Stefani's estranged mom, Darlene, from Iris. Stefani finds old letters with Iris's address and drives there.<br/><br/>Stefani arrives at a heavily fortified home. She tells Iris about her dreams, and Iris says it's her premonition. Fifty years ago, Iris and her boyfriend, Paul, went to the grand opening of the Skyline Tower. Paul and Iris went to the observation deck. During Paul's proposal, Iris had a premonition that everyone would die. She and a little boy, JB, would be last. She warned everyone and saved their lives. Since that day, everyone and their descendants died in the order they would have that night. Death is still after Iris and her heirs.<br/><br/>Iris runs after Stefani but stops at the doorway. Iris chooses to risk it and begs Stefani to take the book. Stefani grabs it, but Iris can still see disbelief in Stefani's eyes. Iris takes three steps back and lets Death take her. Stefani rushes to her family to warn them, but it is too late. A member met a gruesome end. Death is coming for them, but can Stefani make her family believe before it's too late?<br/><br/>This Final Destination installment doesn't disappoint. The deaths are grisly and cringe-inducing, and you are guaranteed to have a new fear unlocked. The writers injected more humor into this chapter with added gore. Unlike its predecessors, this film didn't rely too heavily on the signs. Stefani got a bad feeling and acted accordingly. This film doesn't offer mid or post-credit scenes. This tribute to Tony Todd is a bloody, good time with lots of laughs and guts.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Isaac inserts his hearing aids while his son, Ky, questions Isaac about his scars. Isaac answers honestly and tells his son they came from bad guys—the same bad guys keeping Ky's mother, Kyrah, away. Ky admits that he misses Kyrah. Isaac promises that Kyrah will come home when she can.<br/><br/>Isaac takes Ky to the bank, and several armed people enter. He asks the robber to let Ky walk to him, but the robber points his gun at Ky's head. Isaac removes his hearing aids and unleashes his wrath on the bank robbers. He grabs Ky and exits the bank while taking stock of the cameras.<br/><br/>The bank footage goes viral. Newly-appointed Secretary General Cinder views it and goes into a rage. He briefs the heads of several governments about an elite group of assassins he created called Shadow Force. They operated with one rule: they couldn't leave. Kyrah and Isaac defected when she got pregnant. Cinder will double the bounty on Isaac and Kyrah.<br/><br/>Kyrah sits alone and watches the video. She thinks back to the day she left Isaac and Ky. She knew Cinder wouldn't stop hunting them. So, she vowed to hunt each member of the Shadow Force. Kyrah knew they wouldn't see her coming because no mother would leave their child. With Isaac's cover blown, she must locate her family and protect them from Cinder. If she fails, she will lose everything.<br/><br/>An audience wouldn't expect an action film on Mother's Day, but this film is a bloody hug to moms everywhere. Ky is the unexpected comic relief in this film. The plot overreaches for its runtime. The script attempts to add a twist but gives the audience too much foreshadowing. The fight scenes are intentionally blurry but add comedy to distract. While the script and action have flaws, it's an endearing action movie with old-school love and solid family values, but not for younger viewers.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Guitarist Sammie leaves the cotton fields for home and searches for his guitar. Pastor Jebediah admits to taking it. He fears evil will prey on his son if Sammie continues to play the devil's music. Sammie won't let Jebediah's worries deter him. He takes his guitar and exits the church. His cousins, twins Elijah 'Smoke' and Elias 'Stack' Moore, wait for him.<br/><br/>Everyone in Clarksdale, Mississippi, knows the Smokestack Twins are not to be trifled with. They fought in World War 1 and worked with mobsters in Chicago. They recently bought a sawmill and will turn it into a juke joint tonight. Smoke and Stack want Sammie to play at their establishment.<br/><br/>The crowd gathers at the juke joint for fun, singing, and dancing. Soon, Stack gets word that his ex-girlfriend, Mary, is in attendance. Stack tells her to leave, but Mary refuses.<br/><br/>During the performances, three people approach the juke joint. Remmick, Bert, and Joan heard Sammie's performance and wanted to play. However, the twins don't believe they will be comfortable and could cause trouble, so they don't invite the trio inside. Mary discovers the twins haven't made enough money and wants to meet the trio to determine trustworthiness. The juke joint is about to dance with the devil. Will they survive?<br/><br/>This movie turns the overworked vampire genre into something special with the 1930s backdrop and spectacular score. The film opens with a brief introduction to a shared folklore. There's music so enchanting that it can pierce the veil between the past and future, the living and the dead, and invite evil. As the tune plays, the director adds past and present music styles along with different types of dancers. It makes the opening sequence come to life and transports you into the world in between. Also, the scenes with the twins interacting are nearly flawless, but the blood scenes are a bit over the top. This movie is captivating, educational, and a tad scary. However, stay for the mid and post-credit scenes. The director, writers, and composers made this film for the big screen.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
