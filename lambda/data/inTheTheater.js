    "review": "After Neteyam's death, Neytiri and Jake debate what to do with Spider. Neytiri, unable to bear Spider's resemblance to those who killed her son, wants him gone, while Jake hesitates. That night, Spider's mask fails, and he begins gasping, prompting a frantic search for his spare mask. They save him for the moment, but Jake realizes the replacement mask will also eventually fail. When the Wind Traders arrive in Metkayina, Jake decides to bring Spider back to the humans for his safety.<br/><br/>Jake, Spider, and the family travel with the Wind Traders toward the RDA ship. En route, the Mangkwan, or Ash People, attack their aircraft. Amidst the chaos, Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak are separated from the group. Spider's mask battery runs low, and his spare batteries are with the wreckage. Spider collapses. Kiri lays him down, links her queue to the ground, and puts a bug in his mouth. Spider miraculously recovers. Colonel Miles witnesses this and becomes determined to capture his son and bring him to RDA for study. Jake knows that if Miles gains access to this miracle, humans will become unstoppable. The coming battle will result in heavy loss, two new unions, and new life for Pandora.<br/><br/>The third installment of the Avatar franchise focuses on the action while building the Pandora lore. The graphics draw you into Na'vi's world with motion and colors that were meant for 3D, and the score teleports the audience into each breathtaking adventure. While nothing will ever top this first, this film towers above the second in every category. This film has no mid-credit or end-credit scenes. If you are a fan of the first two, then you must see this one in theaters and in 3D with the best sound.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Partners Judy and Nick became famous for saving Zootopia from a civil war. However, Chief Bogo thinks it was a fluke because they are different. Bogo presents their latest case to the squad. It's a crooked dock inspector. He gives the team their assignments and puts Nick and Judy on observation. However, they aren't there. Officer Clawhauser informs Bogo that Nick and Judy are on the scene and took the lead.<br/><br/>The bust becomes a TV spectacle, putting Judy and Nick in the hot seat. Judy tries to explain that she found snakeskin in one of the crates, but Bogo won't listen. Besides, reptiles haven't been in Zootopia in 100 years. That's when they created the weather wall. Judy discovers that the culprit will be attending the Zootenial Gala. Zootopia's founder, Ebenezer Lynxley, will be honored at the event. His family will display his journal, which contains the idea and blueprints for Zootopia.<br/><br/>Judy convinces Nick to attend the gala undercover. Judy bumps into Pawbert Lynxley, Ebenezer's grandson, and he's smitten with her. His father, Milton, runs the family business and upholds the legacy with his other two children, Kitty and Cattrick. Nick shines a light on the culprit before they grab the journal and try to run away. Judy and Nick follow them into a private room and remove their cloak. It's Gary De'Snake. He tells Judy they aren't the bad guys and the journal can prove it. Before Gary reads the journal, Milton, Kitty, and Cattrick kick open the doors. Bogo barges into the room, and Gary accidently bites him with one of his fangs. Judy breaks it and holds it in her hand. When the other officers enter, Milton says Judy, Nick, and Gary attempted to kill Bogo. They escape before the police arrest them, but they are enemy number one. Can Judy and Nick clear their name while helping Gary uncover the truth?<br/><br/>This sequel is clever, endearing, and funny. It covers perception, smear campaigns, history washing, and forced migration with ease and compassion. During these hard-hitting topics, the script tackles the partnership between Judy and Nick. The animation rivals the first film. Disney manages to give the animals human-like qualities while displaying their unique animalistic characteristics. This installment expands the animal world while rooted in its core cast. The beginning recaps what happened in the first film, so you don't have to see it to enjoy this. The end-credit scene gives the viewer a hint at what is to come. See Zootopia 2 with the whole family today.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Running Man",
    "review": "Ben asks his old boss, Richard, to remove him from the blacklist. Ben can't find work with the scarlet letter on his record, and his daughter, Cathy, is sick. However, Richard won't change his mind because Ben spoke to union leaders about his working conditions. Ben will remain on the list.<br/><br/>Ben watches game shows with Cathy until his wife, Sheila, returns home. She wants to spend time with Cathy, but changes her mind after feeling Cathy's fever. He hates that she has to flirt with wealthy men for tips, especially after one client killed her co-worker. He gets an idea. He will go to the network building and be a contestant on one of their shows. Sheila rejects the idea because she fears he will try out for The Running Man. Ben assures her he would never try out for that game before leaving.<br/><br/>Ben walks through the gates of the network building. They pull up his work history and tell him to go to elevator 26. Hopeful contestants, Jenni and Tim, greet Ben. The Network showrunners perform physical and psychological tests on the contestants. To Ben's surprise, they picked him to be on the Running Man. Ben tries to force them to change, but they refuse.<br/><br/>Ben meets with the Network owner, producer Dan. Dan shows Ben the lucrative contract. He gets a bonus for every day he remains alive and a $500 signing bonus. Ben signs the contract and assures Dan he will be the first contestant to go the distance.<br/><br/>Dan introduces Ben, Tim, and Jenni to the show's hosts, Bobby T.. Bobby gives a quick hello before running on the stage. Ben rages at the false narrative Bobby spins to make the fans hate him. Then, Bobby gives the rules. The runners will have a 12-hour head start. The further they go, the more money they will make. They have to film themselves every day for 10 minutes and drop it in a mailbox. If they don't, they won't get the money, but the hunters will still come after them. They have to last 30 days. Ultimately, they will receive $1 billion. Will he survive the Running Man and make it home to his family?<br/><br/>Based on The Running Man by Steven King, this film has a spectacular pace, wild stunts, and a fresh twist on a familiar plot. This film isn't just about a man running for his life. It's a searing indictment of media manipulation by corporations. The director uses different camera techniques to capture Ben's runs. It could be a steady drone camera shot, a GoPro-style shot, a handheld camera shot, or standard movie framing. These changes display an enticing view of Ben and his run. The soundtrack stays in step with Ben's speed and gets you excited. The action slows with a purpose. It speaks to corruption, pollution, and screen addiction. The plot delivers these messages without getting too topic-heavy or self-righteous. This film is an exciting and violent ride.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Now You See Me: Now You Don't",
    "review": "The four horsemen - Atlas, Jack, Henley, and Merritt - return to the stage after 10 years apart in Bushwick, New York City. They bring an audience member, Roscoe, on stage and possess his body. In Bosco's body, they find a man in the crowd who uses cryptocurrency to swindle people out of their pensions and retirement funds. They use their magic to steal his money, redistribute the wealth, exit Bosco's body, and flee the scene. The cryptobro jumps on stage and realizes the four Horsemen were a hologram. Bosco escapes with his friends, June and Charlie, and laughs. They return to their hidden apartment and gloat about their trick. Bosco asks Charlie to turn off the Atlas hologram. However, it remains. It's the real Atlas. He got a card from The Eye asking him to find the three magicians and run a new trick with them. The Eye wants Atlas to steal Veronica Vanderberg's Heart Diamond for $500 million. She uses her business to launder money for the world's worst criminals.<br/><br/>Veronica prepares to show off her family's diamond for the first time in 25 years. She assembles outfits for a photoshoot when someone calls her. The scrambled voice tells Veronica that they want the diamond. If she doesn't hand it over, they will expose her family's dark secrets. Veronica joins her party and sees Atlas. She assumes he was the threatening caller. He, Bosco, June, and Charlie steal the diamond. When they run away, Jack jumps with razor-sharp cards. Then, Henley joins them in battle. When cornering the Horsemen, the security guards start to play an air violin. Merritt jumps out and takes out the remaining guard. The original four Horsemen, Bosco, Charlie, and June, escape onto a boat and discuss what's next. Then, Charlie notices their playing cards combine to make a map of a French Château. Jack and Merritt don't want to go because their last trick landed Dylan in a Russian prison. Atlas convinces them to perform one more trick.<br/><br/>They enter the dwelling and find a treasure trove of magical history. Thaddeus appears because the Eye sent him. Charlie looks around and realizes they are in Jasper Maskelyn's home. The team believes the Eye wants them to do the same thing. They will do everything in their power to shut down Veronica's operation and find a new home for the diamond.<br/><br/>This third installment contains the sleight of hand fans love with razzle-dazzle fight scenes and an overarching story. The plot lets the audience know that the Horsemen have moved on with their lives. The writers presented the new magicians with a quick backstory. This picture globe hops and offers new tricks. The best scene is watching the elder and new magicians attempt to trick each other. Nothing will be as good as the first, but this installment was better than the second. It was funnier, bigger, and more magical. The edits were a bit jumpy, but it doesn't lose its magic. It's worth your time at the theaters, but you won't buy the DVD.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sarah's Oil",
    "review": "Sarah Rector was free and a descendant of Creek Natives. After the Treaty of 1866, she was in a unique position to acquire 160 acres of land at the age of 11. Sarah walked into the office and signed her name proudly. Her parents, Rose and Joseph, want to sell her land because they can't pay the $30 property tax. However, Sarah has other plans. She convinces her father to ask local oil companies to drill on her land. He relents.<br/><br/>Joseph approaches several oil companies, but most won't let him walk into the front door. He asks Sarah to wait outside while he speaks to Devnan at Pan Oklahoma Petroleum. Sarah walks into Busy Bee Café and asks for water. However, the waitress points to the whites only sign. Then, Bert Smith offers to buy Sarah a lemonade. Sarah thanks Bert before leaving. She storms into Devnan's office and demands a deal. He will rent the land for six months. If he finds oil, he will give Sarah royalties. She agrees.<br/><br/>After three months, Devnan says the well is dry and wants to end their deal. Later that night, someone tries to buy it from Sarah, but she says no. Sarah marches to a day worker area and spots Bert. She asks him to help her drill on the land. Sarah believes Devnan lied when he said it was dry and that the buyer was working for him. Bert surveys the area and discovers that Devnan set up oil drills around Sarah's property. He knows she has oil and barrels of it. They become partners and start drilling. Sarah has a target on her back. Can she keep what's hers?<br/><br/>Sarah is a no-nonsense individual with strong faith and a solid educational background. This film, based on a true story, covers Jim Crow Laws, twisted guardianship, and the murders of indigenous child landowners. It covers the history without the gory details. The writers explain the law in a way that young tweens can understand. The script injects humor to keep the story jovial. This film tackles a sensitive history with a light touch, and it entertains with humor and faith.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
