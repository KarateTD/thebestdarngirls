    "review":"Rookie, Valerie Young, and her riding partner, Sergeant Mitchell, drop their lunch break for a rowdy fight outside a casino. When Young tries to get a handle on the situation, a man sucker-punches her.  She tases the man, and Young and Mitchell take him to the police station.  The man is Teddy Murretto, and he will be in lock up for a while.  Later, Mitchell gets a call about an abandoned unmarked police cruiser with bullet holes on the side of the road.  As the cops investigate the scene, a drunk driver hits the car and almost kills the cops. They book him as John Doe and put him into another holding cell.  After a throat-closing incident, Young comes down to check on the men.  She finds out that Teddy is a con-man that chose to get locked up to keep himself safe.  However, this was an ill-calculated move.  Across from John Doe, Teddy recognizes the man.  His real name is Bob Viddick, and he is a contract killer.  Viddick got himself locked up to complete the contract on Teddy.  Before the night is over, Young will have to decide who she can trust: a professional, a psychopath, a crooked cop, or a con-man.<br/><br/>This movie takes a second to get started, but it's necessary to set up all the pieces in the game, like Mouse Trap.  Once all the players, plots, and bullets are in place, the knockdown, drag-out fight begins.  Be aware there are no wasted moments on screen.  The broadcasts, backstories, and jokes have a point to the overall plot. This movie takes its time, but it's worth every second to see these opposing forces battle it out.  Based on the ending, maybe we will get a part two.  Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cry Macho",
    "review":"A year ago, Howard fired Mike, a 5-time rodeo winner, from his promotion.  Now, Howard needs a favor.  Thirteen years ago, Howard met Leta at a party, and the two had a son, Rafael. Now, Howard learned that Leta and others abuse Rafael. So, Howard asks Mike to go to Mexico and bring Rafael to him in Texas.  When Mike says no, Howard threatens to stop financially supporting him.  So, Mike heads to Mexico and travels to Leta's compound. Leta tells him that Rafael is a dangerous, cock-fighting teen who's unfindable.  Howard ignores Leta but hears a clue in her words.  He goes to the local cockfight and finds Rafael hiding after the police leave the scene.  He grabs Rafael's rooster, named Macho, and convinces Rafael to leave with him.  But it won't be that easy to get Rafael to Texas.<br/><br/>Based on Cry Macho by N. Richard Nash, this movie is proof that some books shouldn't be movies.  In the long, and often unnecessary, lulls, your mind will wander.  Now, there is a sweet love story, but it's not needed to get Rafael home.  It's for Mike's closure.  If you have HBO Max, watch it there.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings",
    "review":"Shaun works as a valet with his best friend, Katy, and any chance they get to lollygag, they take it. They talk on the bus about their futures and their family's expectations.  A man approaches Shaun and tells Shaun to give him his pendant.  Shaun refuses, and the gang of men fight. With unstable motion, the bus knocks out the driver.  Katy gets into the driver's seat during the fight.  Together, Katy and Shaun save the passengers and fight off the men.  But they take Shaun's pendant. He tells Katy that he has to find his sister, Xialing, and save her from their father, Wenwu.  This detail stuns Katy because she never knew Shaun had any family.  He tells Katy that he is getting on the next flight to see Xialing, and Katy doesn't hesitate to go with him.  On the flight, Shaun explains that his name is Shang-Chi.  And love, pain, and revenge blanket his family history. For thousands of years, Wenwu grew power exponentially thanks to the ten rings he found or stole, depending on which legend you believe.  Then, Wenwu learned of a forest called Ta Lo with mythical creatures that possessed unknown strength. He travels to Ta Lo and finds a beautiful woman, Jiang Li. Jiang Li protects Ta Lo and all its strength.  The two fell in love and tried to stay in Ta Lo, but they ex-communicated Jiang Li and stripped her of her powers.  After Jiang Li died, Wenwu raised Shang-Chi to be an assassin while developing the ten rings gang.  When Shang-Chi turned 16, Wenwu asked Shang-Chi to avenge his mother.  Shang-Chi left and never came back.  Now, Shang-Chi must save his sister before Wenwu comes for her.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the synopsis because there is still more story to go.  The brief overview is only 30 minutes into the movie. This movie separates itself with a storyline that doesn't focus on good or evil but grief and loss.  In the beginning, everything is more realistic, but as the story delves deeper into Ta Lo, it becomes more magical, like Dr. Strange. The graphics are the best yet for the MCU, and the bus fight scene is one of the best. It puts Captain Marvel and Spider-Man to shame.  And let's never forget the fight between Wenwu and Jiang Li.  Their combative dance of love and power is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Now that most of the world is underwater, people come to Nick and Watts to use Reminiscence.  It is a machine that taps into someone's memories. Some people do it to relive happy times with loved ones, relive days of better health, or find lost items.  Nick, an interrogator, guides them through their memories.  Before they close, a woman, Mae, walks into Nick and Watts's place of business because she lost her keys and needs the machine to help her locate them.  They find the keys, but Mae transfixes Nick with a song.  After Mae leaves, Watts finds Mae's earring, and Nick jumps at the chance to return it.  Nick goes to Mae's work and watches her sing all night before returning her earring.  They start a love affair. Without a word, Mae disappeared, and Nick doesn't believe she would leave.  He thinks something happened to her.  When Nick investigates a kingpin's muscle, Nick sees Mae in the muscle's memories.  Nick will see a side to Mae that will destroy his fairytale but reignite his need to locate her and the truth about her.<br/><br/>The Mystery of Mae through Memories is another title for this film as Nick questions himself and his love every step of the way. Imagine having someone you love seeing you in the eyes of others.  Would they love you more or fear you? Or would they feel like they never knew you? Nick goes through all of these emotions as he explores Mae's past in the minds of others.  While this film is visually captivating and contains intriguing storytelling, you won't have an urge to watch it twice nor buy it.  HBO Max is the best way to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Free Guy",
    "review":"Guy works as a banker in Free City.  Every day, Guy wakes up, says hi to his goldfish, gets coffee, goes to work, gets robbed multiple times, and goes home.  The robbers are the sunglasses people. While Guy adores his life, he tells his best friend, Buddy, the bank security guard, that he is missing something: love. As Guy walks down the street with Buddy, he sees a woman humming a familiar song and becomes fixated on her.  Buddy reminds Guy that the woman is wearing sunglasses and sunglasses people don't talk to them. Guy decides to get a pair of sunglasses and talk to his dream woman.  During the next bank robbery, Guy gets up and asks the robber for his glasses.  When Guy tries to take them, he accidently shoots the robber, gets the glasses, and follows the woman.  She is Molotov Girl, a level 197, experienced player. Molotov Girl tells Guy to put on the glasses, and Guy sees a whole new world of experience points, money, and power-ups.  Molotov Girl tells Guy to rob or punch someone, and he will level up quickly.  But Guy doesn't want to hurt people. Guy's nice guy routine catches the world by storm because Guy is an Non-Player Character or NPC in the world's most popular game, Free City. But Guy doesn't know it.  Molotov Girl does, and in real life, she is Millie, a game designer.  In 2015, Millie and Walter, a.k.a. Keys, created a world with AI.  People can watch as the NPCs learn, grow, and develop lives.  While Keys works for Soonami and its owner Antwan, Millie sued them.  She believes Antwan stole their base code to create Free City.  She spends her time in the game trying to find the proof on an unseen level. At first, Millie needed Guy to prove her case, but now she will need Guy to save himself, Free City, and his friends before Antwan destroys the servers.<br/><br/>This movie speaks to anyone who felt like a background character in their lives. While this movie inspires, it highlights issues in the gaming world.  This mix of Jumanji: The Next Level, Ready Player One, and The Lego Movie has memorable moments, laughable dialogue, a love story, and lots of easter eggs.  In the end, you will learn that someone created Guy with a purpose, and he isn't any ordinary NPC.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
