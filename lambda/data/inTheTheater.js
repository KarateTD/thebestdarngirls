    "review":"After seeing his friend's home turned into an arson target, Owen takes cash out of his bank account, grabs his son, Connor, gets in his car, and drives away.  Owen decides to go to Ethan's house.  Ethan is Owen's brother, the sheriff of a small town, and has a baby on the way with his fiance, Allison.  Owen explains to Connor that he found a problem while working as a forensic accountant. Now, someone murdered his friend in the arson, and Owen knows he is next.  Owen writes a note and gives it to Connor. On their drive to Ethan's, Patrick and Jack start shooting at Owen's car.  Patrick and Jack are the same hitmen that killed Owen's friend.  Owen's car careens into the woods, and he knows he has very little time to save Connor.  Owen tells Connor to take the note and hide in the woods. Connor leaves the car and Owen slams on the gas.  Seeing someone is alive, the hitmen take more shots at the vehicle, and Connor watches Owen die.  Believing their mission is complete, Patrick and Jack leave the scene.  Connor starts to run and runs into Hannah. She warns Connor that he is going the wrong way, and if he wants to live, he will go her way.  Connor decides to follow Hannah and give her his note.  With Owen's written word, Hannah knows Connor is in danger. Patrick and Jack listen in to the police radio calls.  And when they hear that police found only one body in the car, they know Connor is alive. So, the hitmen start a fire to preoccupy the police while they find Connor.  With the hitmen after them, Connor and Hannah will have to go into the fire to save themselves.<br/><br/>Based on Those Who Wish Me Dead by Michael Koryta, this movie provides action, but it's nothing new.  While Hannah and Connor are the main focal point of the story, it's Allison versus Patrick that will keep your eyes glued to the TV. While you fall in love with that action, you never feel a growing concern for Connor or Hannah in the woods surrounded by fire.  One endearing aspect of this film is that it shows another side of depression.  After losing people on the job, Hannah becomes a risk-taker. Allison's battle and Hannah's expression of depression are the watchable points of this film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"For years, hundreds of newly-Islam-converted teens and women, from London, traveled to Syria after falling for a Jihadist man they met through social media.  While reporters know that social media is the latest recruitment tactic, no one knows the complex network to get these females into Syria alone. With no money in the bank, Amy pitches the idea to find how the network operates to her chief editor, Vick. Amy creates a Facebook profile and sets up recording software on her laptop.  After setting up her account, Amy goes through Friends lists of anyone spreading extremist material. Soon, Abu contacts her.  She goes through his profile and believes he is a terrorist.  When he wants to talk via video chat, Amy starts to freak out.  She calls Vick to voice her concerns about the project.  So Vick sweetens the deal.  If Amy can get the story, Vick will give Amy a full-time position. She pushes her fear to the side and makes a video chat date with Abu, a terrorist.  While her profile is fake, the danger and feelings become real.<br/><br/>Based on In The Skin of a Jihadist by Anna Erelle, this film has the cinematography of Searching and the anticipation of Unfriended, which should make for a winning combination.  However, something doesn't resonate with the viewer. While she relies on a tech guy to help her film her chats, hide her desktop, and mask her phone number, it's the little things that give her away.  Yes, Abu is a terrorist, but this movie is a blueprint on how dark romance happens so fast on the internet. If you want a matinee movie for the weekend, this is a good one to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Patrick Hill joins Fortico security after they lost two drivers in an armored truck robbery. His trainer, Bullet, explains that Patrick must get 70 or above to get the job.  Patrick scores 70 on the nose, and Bullet nicknames him H.  Their boss, Terry, put H together with Bullet and Dave. On the second drop, Bullet goes in alone and never comes out.  Dave calls over the walkie-talkie but gets static.  Then a voice comes over the system and tells Dave and H to give up the money or Bullet dies. H starts to turn over the cash but pulls out his gun and shoots each of the robbers in the head.  Dave and Bullet notice H's expert precision doesn't match what he did during training, and they mention it to Terry.  H chalks it up to adrenaline, and Terry orders him to take time off with PTSD counseling.  However, the owner, Blake, says H's legendary status is good for business, and Blake wants H back on the streets immediately. A few months back, H witnesses the murder of his son, Dougie, during the armored truck robbery, the same robbery that left a spot open for H..  And to make matters worse, H was involved in the robbery with just two simple words: the latter.  Now, H is on a mission to find the man that killed Dougie and end his life.<br/><br/>Based on Cash Truck, this movie has John Wick's action with Equalizer's morals and Quentin Tarantino's storytelling.  So you need to be at the theater and in your seat from beginning to end.  In four chapters, this movie peels itself like an onion. The heist, with the mastermind narrating the plan as you see it take place, is perfection.  With this narration, you will hear what should happen and what went wrong.  Don't be shocked if inappropriate moments make you laugh. This movie will be an easy favorite for the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

Charlie meets Emma as his past crashes with his doomed future. During these moments of lost memories, Charlie has vivid flashbacks about his past with his children and wife, Carrie. Even as his world falls apart, he makes jokes. Emma doesn't help him out of obligation, but out of concern and love.  This movie will become a favorite while bringing a tear to your eye and a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Water Man",
    "review":"Gunner sits in his room and writes his graphic novel about Detective Knoxx, a ghost attempting to solve his murder. When Gunner tells his parents, Amos and Mary, that he went to a funeral for more research, Amos can't hide his disbelief. In an attempt to connect with Gunner, Amos walks into Gunner's room to play catch, but Amos steps on his graphic novel, ruining it.  Gunner leaves and rides his bike around town.  On his ride, he sees an abandoned mill with The Water Man painted on the side.  He hears a young girl, Jo, telling a group of kids that she encountered The Water Man and survived. Back at home, Gunner tries to sleep but has a nightmare.  He searches for Mary and finds a frail, bald figure in the bathroom.  Gunner had no idea that Mary's leukemia advanced so aggressively.  Instead of researching detective novels, Gunner focuses on leukemia and anatomy.  Inside one of the books, Gunner finds notes about The Water Man.  Since the author is local, Gunner goes to Bussey's home to get more information.  Bussey explains that The Water Man found a vein of shiny material in a cave and he carved a rock out of it. When the dam broke, everyone in the town, including The Water Man's wife, died.  But The Water Man lived, and he believed it was because of the shining rock he found.  The rock made him immortal.  Now, he searches the woods for his wife's body to give her immortality. Gunner wants to find The Water Man to heal Mary.  And he knows just who can help find The Water Man, Jo. With two kids in the woods, Amos goes on a hunt to find Gunner without telling Mary.  Amos knows he is on borrowed time because there is a danger roaring in the woods that will annihilate Gunner and Jo.  And it isn't The Water Man.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo's directorial debut is a promising award contender this year.  Mixing animation with real-life allows the viewer to see life in Gunner's rich fantasy world. This movie isn't only about Gunner finding The Water Man.  It's about Gunner and Amos finding common ground. By being apart, they call for each other in the darkness and find their bond.  It's a compelling story that will resonate with the whole family.  Be warned, there are a few scary moments, but those are short-lived and explained.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
