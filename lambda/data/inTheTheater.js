    "review": "Jason Crutchfield trains young men to box at the Berston Field House. Every day, a young girl, Claressa Shields, runs to the gym. One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Romy makes passionate love to her husband, Jacob, and leaves the room to use her phone after saying 'I love you.' However, it's a ruse. She sneaks away to another room to watch submission adult videos on her computer while pleasuring herself. Romy practices her speech in the morning and makes encouraging notes for her kids before going to work as the CEO of Tensile Corporation.<br/><br/>Romy sees a dog attacking a man on her way to work. The dog lets the man go and charges for her, but another man stops the dog. Romy's assistant, Esme, tells Romy that a new crop of interns is starting today. Romy talks to them and notices the young man, Samuel, who saved her from the dog. She speaks to the interns and invites them to the company holiday party.<br/><br/>During the Christmas party, Romy escapes to the balcony and smokes a cigarette. Samuel follows her. He reveals that he picked her as his mentor. He scheduled a 10-minute meeting to ask questions about her and the company.<br/><br/>Romy enters the meeting and states that Samuel has 7 minutes. He corrects her and says he has 10. They verbally spar in the room before Samuel asks if she likes power. However, He believes she 'likes to be told what to do.' Samuel laughs off his admission, and Romy hussles to the door. However, he stops her and asks her to stay. She kisses him. Will Romy risk everything for her fantasies?<br/><br/>This film is a statement about the past and current beliefs about a dominant-submissive relationship. Romy has control over her business life but has issues from her past. Also, she harbors issues about her looks. On the surface, she has an idyllic marriage. However, she never expresses her unhappiness in the bedroom. So, Romy's relationship with Samuel is an illogical step, and their power dynamic sways back and forth, leaving you on the edge of your seat. However, only one person uses it to manipulate their way to the top. The neatly wrapped ending falls flat after all the games they play.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mufasa: The Lion King",
    "review": "Simba runs to find Nala and leaves their daughter, Kiara, with Rafiki, Timon, and Pumbaa. Kiara dreams she could be as strong as her grandfather. Rafiki explains that Mufasa wasn't always a king. Rafiki sits Kiara down and tells the story of her grandfather, Mufasa: The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mufasa and his parents, Afia and Masego, are living through drought. Mufasa's mother, Afia, tells Mufasa that the drought won't last forever. Until then, he should look at the horizon. Beyond the light is a land called Milele. Everything in Milele flows in abundance. Then, the rain falls. Mufasa and his family go to the watering hole with the other animals. Later, they hear a rumble and see a flood. An elephant hits the dam, and the water sweeps Mufasa away.<br/><br/>Mufasa struggles on a branch when a cub, Taka, appears. He is the son of King Obasi and Obasi's mate, Eshe. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him ashore. Eshe tells Taka to leave Mufasa alone because Obasi doesn't like strays. Eshe has compassion for the cub and brings Mufasa to the pride. Obasi wants to eat Mufasa, but Mufasa says he is too fast. Obasi creates Taka's first challenge to prove he can be a king. If Taka beats Mufasa in a race, Obasi will eat Mufasa. If Mufasa wins, then he can stay with their pride. They race, but Eshe sees that Taka lets Mufasa win. Obasi keeps his promise but tells Mufasa he must live with the females.<br/><br/>As Taka and Mufasa grow, their brotherly bond becomes tighter, much to Obasi's displeasure. Taka wants to learn how to hunt like Mufasa, but Obasi says his place is sleeping on a rock, protecting the pride. When Obasi falls asleep, Taka follows Eshe to learn. They hear others approaching but don't have time to escape. Mufasa saves Eshe while Taka runs away.<br/><br/>The remaining white lion returns to the leader, Kiros. With a lowered head, the surviving lion explains that Mufasa killed Kiros's son while saving Eshe. Then, he pledges vengeance for his son.<br/><br/>Mufasa can smell Kiros and his pride coming. Eshe tells Taka and Mufasa to leave and protect each other. Kiros believes there can only be one king. They slaughter Obasi's pride. However, Kiros knows the lion who killed his son isn't there. He orders his pride to track Mufasa and Taka. He vows to kill the pair, avenge his son, and become the king.<br/><br/>This Lion King prequel starts with a tribute to James Earl Jones. Then, it transports the audience to Pride Rock. It's not Mufasa's story alone. It's the tale of two brothers, entitlement, courage, and the king's court. By staying with the pride's females, Mufasa learned lessons that separated him from the others. Mufasa's journey mirrors Simba's. He leaves home for safety and finds friends along the way. The graphics far surpass the live adaptation of The Lion King, and the voice acting is stellar. The music flows wonderfully with the theme, although it drowns out the vocal performances. Also, the backing track makes the room vibrate and crescendos with the sun. This film is an astounding prequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3",
    "review": "Tom, Maddie, Tails, and Knuckles throw Sonic a surprise B-EARTH-Day party to celebrate the day he landed on the planet. Tom and Maddie revel in the quiet when a beam of light comes from a helicopter. Director Rockwell exits and asks for Team Sonic's help. An alien escaped a private base in Tokyo. And they can't catch him. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles board the helicopter.<br/><br/>Team Sonic lands in Tokyo and can't believe the alien standing before them looks like Sonic. His name is Shadow. Sonic chases after him, but Shadow outsmarts him. The team meets Commander Walters at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Commander Walters explains that Shadow landed on Earth 50 years ago inside a meteorite. They hid him in a top-secret base to study his powers under the guidance of a professor. The professor's granddaughter, Maria, bonded with Shadow and became best friends. Then, an accident at the base took Maria's life. Now that Shadow is free, he wants revenge for Maria.<br/><br/>Hours ago, someone hacked their system and lowered their defenses. Reports state that Dr. Robotnik's symbol emerged on the screen during the hack. Then, Robotnik's drones enter the restaurant and aim for the team after fatally wounding Commander Walters. Walters hands Sonic a key to a powerful weapon. A motorcyclist rides into the restaurant, incapacitates the attack drones, and exits. The team follows the cyclist until he stops. It's Agent Stone. He says someone framed Dr. Robotnik, and he has proof.<br/><br/>Agent Stone takes the team to Dr. Robotnik's lair. When he learns someone stole his tech, Dr. Robotnik chooses to work with Team Sonic to find the culprit. However, he needs something from Sonic. Sonic rolls his eyes and pulls out a quill. This unlikely mash-up must stop Shadow's revenge and keep the key out of the wrong person's hands.<br/><br/>It may be unbelievable, but this film is the best of the trilogy. First, this adventure is worldwide. Second, this film is about the toxic nature of anger and revenge. Third, this movie respects its core audience by referencing old tech, movies, and jokes. However, it doesn't forget its new fans. The movie kept a steady pace while introducing new characters. The plot didn't waste time recapping the last films. This film is an animated action-adventure comedy for the whole family with mid- and post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Gladiator II",
    "review": "Twin Emperors Geta and Caracalla rule Rome 16 years after Marcus Aurelius's death. The twins ignored Marcus's vision of a Roman government ruled by the people. They want to expand their dominance to other countries with the help of their general, Acacius. Acacius and his soldiers are victorious, capture the defeated soldiers, and make them slaves to Rome, including a refugee named Hanno. Acacius takes the slaves to Ostia. There, Macrinus will determine which slaves will make the best gladiators.<br/><br/>Acacius sees the emperors' corrupt ways and becomes disillusioned with Roman rule. He shares his thoughts with his wife, Lucilla. She shares her father's vision and agrees with Acacius. They must find people who agree and secretly overthrow the emperors.<br/><br/>Macrinus studies the slaves, and Hanno captures his eye. Hanno recites a passage from a Roman poet. Macrinus can see that Hanno has an education. Macrinus despises the emperors' rule and wants to overthrow them too. But he wants Hanno to be his instrument of destruction. Hanno agrees, but only if Macrinus allows him to kill Acacius. Macrinus doesn't know Hanno's secret history to the Roman Empire and true Gladiator.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't focus on the battles like its predecessor. It uses the drama to drive the story forward. This sequel feels more like Shakespeare than an action film. The costumes, dialog, and set design teleport you into 180 AD. However, the audience doesn't rally behind or have concern for Hanno. You will find Macrinus more intriguing than the Gladiator. This picture is bloody and theatrical, but it's missing a spark.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
