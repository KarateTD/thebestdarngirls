    "review":"Lucy works at an art gallery with her boyfriend, Max.  She helps Max with clients and their boss.  Before introducing Max to gallery party attendees, Lucy's coworker tells her Max's ex-girlfriend is in attendance. She sees them get too close and starts to freak out on stage.  By the end of the speech, Lucy has lost her job and her boyfriend. She jumps into Nick's car and starts explaining her sad story.  Nick tries to explain that he isn't her Uber, but Lucy doesn't listen.  To be nice, Nick takes her home. Inside, Lucy's best friends, Nadine and Amanda, are waiting to comfort her.  After days of moping, Nadine and Amanda suggest Lucy purges herself of her past loves by emptying her room.  Lucy keeps mementos of every past relationship.  From Max, she has a tie. With a garbage bag full of memories, she sees Max walking into a restaurant with his new girlfriend.  Nick sees her about to make a scene and pulls her out of the restaurant.  After their public display leads to a woman punching Nick, Nick takes Lucy to his hotel.  Chloe Hotel is Nick's dream, but the funding is running out. Nick labels her a relationship hoarder and a pessimist. Nick grabs a nail, puts it into the drywall, and tells Lucy to hang the tie. Lucy grabs a pin, then labels the drywall: The Heartbreak Gallery.  The next day, Nick shows Lucy an addition to the drywall.  Someone added a map with a breakup story.  Lucy posts the picture online, and it goes viral. Nick's friend reveals that Nick needs more help than he admits.  Since Lucy doesn't have a job, she offers to help him set up the hotel in exchange for gallery space. As Lucy and Nick fall for each other, can Lucy handle Nick's heartbreak memento, or will their love end before it can begin?<br/><br/>This band of misfits plays perfectly off of each other.  With constant verbal jabs and perfectly timed in your face comedic punches, you will laugh while clutching your pearls. Nadine and Amanda understand Lucy's need to hold on, but they implore her to let go of the stuff for her mental health and relationship advancement.  Also, the movie goes in-depth to the root of Lucy's hoarding issue, and it's not what you think.  This movie is fun for an adults-only date night.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Words on Bathroom Walls",
    "review":"When Adam was younger, he thought he had a problem with his eyes, then his ears.  He was seeing and hearing things that weren't there.  One day, a girl named Rebecca appeared. Adam describes her as a mix of Dalai Lama and Coachella.  Next, Joaquin appeared.  He is every dirty thought a teenager could have in his mind.  Then, The Bodyguard.  Whenever Adam feels threaten, he shows up to protect him.  Adam hides his delusions until senior year. When Adam tries to leave chemistry class, he knocks hot acid on his friend's arm.  The security guard holds Adam down.  Adam is diagnosed with schizophrenia and expelled from school.  His mother, Beth, with her boyfriend, Paul, try every drug possible, but nothing helps.  They put Adam on a drug trial and enroll him in a private catholic school. During his bathroom break, Maya walks in with another student and talks about their deal. Smitten, Adam wants to know more about her, but she quickly puts him in his place and tells him to keep his mouth shut about her side hustle. So, he asks Maya to help him with math. As the delusions disappear and his grades get better, Adam falls for Maya. He falls so much, Adam shows her his passion: Cooking.  When Adam cooks, he is at peace.  And Adam hopes to go to culinary school someday.  However, he doesn't disclose his diagnosis to her.  When the pills threaten his culinary future, Adam stops taking them.  Can he succeed without the drugs and keep Maya's love while keeping his diagnosis a secret?<br/><br/>Based on Words on Bathroom Walls by Julia Walton, this movie takes a real look at mental illness during the formable teenage years.  Its take on schizophrenia is similar to The Fault in Our Stars take on cancer.  The plot never villainizes Adam or his illness.  Adam states I am not the disease, I have a disease.  And he compares how society treats people with cancer compared to those with schizophrenia. For a better understanding, the movie takes you through the trials and tribulations of the family members during diagnosis and treatment.  Also, the film doesn't make medication the cure-all.  The plot discusses the physical and mental side effects of taking medication.  The ending is heartwarming but honest and realistic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The New Mutants",
    "review":"Dani's father wakes her up because a tornado is attacking their reservation.  He tells Dani to hide in the woods and stay there until he comes back.  Moments later, his dead body flies past her, and she runs.  Only to stumble, fall, and hit her head.  She wakes up handcuffed to a hospital bed and locked in a room.  She screams for help, then Dr. Reyes appears. Dr. Reyes tells Dani her entire reservation died, but she survived because she's a mutant. The doctor explains that during Dani's hospital stay, she will discover and learn to control her powers.  When she is not a threat to society or herself, Dani will leave the hospital and meet the higher-ups.  During a group session, Dani meets the other mutants.  Each teenage mutant hides a dark secret about their past and wants out of the hospital.  Dani believes if she follows the regimen, she will be released.  And all the mutants hope they will leave the hospital and become X-Men.  But during a session, Dani sees Dr. Reyes's secrets.  She and the other mutants are in danger.  They have to find a way out of the hospital, past Dr. Reyes and her force field, and past their most dangerous enemy: their fears.<br/><br/>The direction of this superhero movie starts as a horror movie.  It is engaging and riveting for the viewer. It allows you to wonder about what Dani can do and how it affects others.  The CGI is better than most, and the cast plays the mutants dynamically. However, The New Mutants ends like a Disney movie. For all the intense drama and character development throughout the storyline, the ending is very disappointing. This movie has such promise and leaves you with nothing.  By the way, there is no post-credit scene.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cut Throat City",
    "review":"After Hurricane Katrina, James hasn't been able to find a job as an artist.  He has an associates degree from Tulane and created a graphic novel called Cut Throat City. After FEMA turns down his aid request, James and his three friends - Junior, Miracle, and Dre, visit James's Cousin Bass. Bass gives them a job.  They have to rob a local casino and give Bass the cash and chips from the robbery. During the robbery, Miracle, the lookout and driver, sees several uniformed officers about to enter the casino.  Miracle starts shooting. After a high-speed shootout, Dre was hit and died. The next morning they see Bass.  Bass expects a lot of money because the newspaper says the robbers took $150,000.  However, James reports they only stole $25,000, but they spent some. Even if the paper lied, Bass suspects the men got $100,000, so Bass wants $80,000.  James promises to get the money with interest, but that's not good enough for Bass.  James calls his wife and tells her to leave town with their son, then goes into hiding.  On the other side of New Orleans, Detective Lucinda gets a call from the Councilman.  No police officers reported being in a shoot out.  The cops were fake, so someone set up James and his friends.  Until they know, James, Junior, and Miracle know they can't come back to the 9th ward without Bass's money.  They only know one way to get back home: rob casinos and take the money to the Saint for safe passage.<br/><br/>Cut Throat City starts like a lot of heist movies; the main character is down on their luck and decides to do one crime to make things right. As the plot becomes more complicated, it starts to lose focus.  Instead of a heist movie, it becomes a movie about government and police corruption.  In the end, the conclusion gives an alternate ending, but you don't know where the fake ending started in the story.  So, you will have more questions than answers.  Hopefully, the DVD extras will explain it all.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rachel got some bad news; her soon-to-be-ex-husband wants the house.  Exhausted from a late-night, Rachel tells her lawyer, Andy, she will handle it later because she is running late to take her son, Kyle, to school and go to work.  During the drive, Rachel gets a call from her client.  When the client hears Rachel will be late again, the client fires Rachel over the phone. She decides to get off the freeway and take Kyle to school using the backstreets.  At the light, she sits behind a pickup truck, but the driver doesn't move during the green light.  Rachel lays on the horn, then drives around.  At the next light, the pickup truck driver asks Kyle to roll down his window.  He asks if Rachel knows what a courtesy honk is and why she didn't use it.  Frustrated, she tells the man he was in the wrong.  The man apologizes for being upset and ignoring the light.  In turn, the man wants Rachel to apologize too.  She refuses to apologize.  The man vows to make her see what a bad day is.  Then, he starts to follow her down the street, leaving accidents and injuries in his wake. Rachel gets gas and sees the man behind her car.  She alerts the gas station clerk and a good Samaritan. The man hits the Samaritan and stalks Rachel on the road. Rachel doesn't know the man killed his ex-wife and her new husband just hours prior.  He is a monster with pure road rage, and Rachel is in his crosshairs.<br/><br/>Unhinged is a thriller, suspense, and horror movie all rolled into one.  You must be in your seat during the opening credits to see news clips of people losing it on the road.  By witnessing the unhinged man kill in the beginning, it helps you understand that Rachel isn't the driving force behind his actions.  She is just the next victim of his rage. This hard-hitting movie will make you jump in your seat, shock you, and leave you with a lasting impact.  See it in theaters today.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
