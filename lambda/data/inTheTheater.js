    "review":"Otis Haywood and Otis Jr. prepare their horse, Ghost, for Ghost's next film role. During training, debris falls from the sky and gravely wounds Otis. Otis Jr., also known as OJ, tries to get Otis to the hospital, but it's too late.<br/><br/>Now, shy OJ has to run the business with his outspoken little sister, Emerald. While Emerald wants to be in front of the camera, she does all the talking on set. OJ takes the horse and Emerald to Jupiter's Claim, a small western-themed attraction in town. OJ sells his horse to the owner Jupe but hopes to repurchase it. Emerald can't believe OJ is selling the horses, but he doesn't want to hear her opinion because she isn't involved with the ranch. They make up over drinks and music when Emerald notices Ghost is in the arena. OJ goes to wrangle the horse but sees something moving in the clouds, causing anything electrical to go out.<br/><br/>OJ tells Emerald what he saw, and they go to the electronic store to get some cameras. The cashier, Angel, offers to help set it up as part of the store's deal. Angel sets up the cameras but becomes curious when OJ asks him to point the cameras at the sky. So he hacks in and watches. Angel notices one cloud never moves. He knows the Haywoods have a UFO or U.A.P.. With proof, Emerald calls the director, Antlers, from the shoot and asks for help to capture the Oprah shot. Emerald and OJ hope the footage will save their ranch, but they have no clue what they are dealing with in the sky.<br/><br/>Executives marked this film as a horror, but this Jordan Peele experience is more thriller and comedy, and it gives a brief history of cinema but focuses on the ranch. The script allows viewers to see the relationship between Emerald and OJ and OJ's growth. The juxtaposition between the sibling's personalities blares on screen. At times you want to cover your eyes, but Peele adds comedy to keep your eyes on the screen. The graphics on the UFO and its inner working are visually compelling. This movie has less social commentary than other works by Peele. So it won't be your favorite of his works, but it is fun to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Where the Crawdads Sing",
    "review":"On October 30th, 1969, in Barkley Cove, North Carolina, two boys riding their bikes along the marsh find Chase Andrews's body. They determine that Chase fell from the fire tower. They find red fiber on Chase and have a lab examine it.<br/><br/>The officers go to the bar, and everyone talks about the case. Tom, a retired lawyer, overhears the whispered commotion. There were rumors that Chase was secretly dating the 'Marsh Girl' and someone heard her threaten him.<br/><br/>The police go to see the Marsh Girl the next day. They look through the girl's things and unearth a red hat. They take her to jail while the town hurls insults. When the lab determines the hat matches the fibers found on Chase, they charge the Marsh Girl with murder.<br/><br/>Tom walks into the jail cell and introduces himself to the Marsh Girl. But he knows her as Catherine Danielle Clark, but her family calls her Kya. Kya resided alone on the marsh since she was a child. Her mother, Ma, left Kya and Kya's siblings with their abusive alcoholic father, Pa. Kya, a child then, decided to stay with him and be invisible. Tom offers to represent Kya in the murder trial but pleads for Kya to open up to him. Tom knows that the jury will use their preconceived notions against her. Tom needs to prove Kya's innocence and place in society. Or she will get the death penalty.<br/><br/>Based on Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, be ready to feel the words jump off the page. The director used the marsh, lagoon, and swamp to narrate pages of complex land descriptions. At first, the swamp looks daunting and frightening. As Kya grows into a young woman, the swamp is inviting, loving, and full of life. The mystery unfolds with flashbacks and courtroom questioning. At times, these two intertwining storylines conflict or compliment each other. It's a mystery that waits for the last 15 seconds to give you the killer and the reason.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank",
    "review":"Ika Chu puts the finishing touches on the Shogun's palace before the Shogun arrives. There is a lot to do, but Ika Chu needs his cats to remove one eyesore blocking the perfect view. It's a small town called Kakamucho, protected by a samurai. When the samurai sees the mass amount of cat warriors heading to the town, the samurai runs away, leaving Kakamucho defenseless.<br/><br/>The citizens of Kakamucho demand the Shogun send a new samurai, and the Shogun delegates the job to Ika Chu. He sees a dog, Hank, facing execution for walking into cat territory. Hank admits to crossing the border only to receive samurai training. Ika Chu appoints Hank the new samurai because he knows the cats of Kakamucho will kill a dog on sight.<br/><br/>Ika Chu's prediction is correct, and the cats attack Hank. But they stop when Hank proves he is the new samurai. Hank meets Jimbo, a hesitant sensei with too much catnip, and convinces Jimbo to train him. Ika Chu can't fathom the cats accepting this dog, so he vows to destroy Hank and Kakamucho before Shogun arrives.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Blazing Saddles, this movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, the characters never forget it's a movie. It takes everyday activities, like tweeting, and transforms the tweet into an actual bird. This film is an animated, classic comedy you grew up watching. It's worth every penny, and you will enjoy it more than your children.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Thor: Love and Thunder",
    "review":"Gorr walks the deserts of his land with his daughter. He prays for his God to bring food and water for his child, but she dies in his arms. As he weeps on her grave, an oasis appears. Gorr asks his God why he didn't assist him and his daughter. His God admits he didn't care and can find new followers. Gorr renounces his God and then summons the killer's weapon, Necrosword, to him and slays the God. He vows to become the new God Killer and murder every God and their followers.<br/><br/>After defeating Thanos and his army, Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to defend the universe. The battles are simple for this God of Thunder. After Thor finishes another battle leaving the Guardians useless, they looked for more distressed planets. And Thor spots Sif. Thor and Korg go to Sif and find her injured on the battlefield. She warns Thor that Asgard is Gorr's next stop. Thor, Korg, and Sif head to Asgard.<br/><br/>Dr. Jane Foster wrote a book and is a leader in her field, but she spends more time researching her stage 4 cancer than the stars. Then, Jane hears Mjolnir calling her name. She travels to Asgard, a vacation destination, and searches for the shattered pieces of Mjolnir. In Asgard, King Valkyrie spends more time on politics than battle.<br/><br/>Thor, Korg, and Sif return to Asgard and discover it under attack. Gorr summoned shadow monsters to attack the Asgardians. Thor grabs Stormbreaker for battle but sees a familiar object ripping through creatures. It's Mjolnir. Thor calls the hammer towards him, but it's under the control of someone else: Jane, The Mighty Thor. However, they don't notice other shadow monsters stealing the Asgard children until it's too late.<br/><br/>As Valkyrie, Jane, and Thor create a plan to rescue the kids, Axl, Heimdall's son, connects to Thor using his inherited gifts. Through Axl's eyes, Thor can see the children inside a Shadow Realm cave. Valkyrie and Thor exchange a look. They know the best place to summon a God's army is Omnipotent City and then asking Zeus. They can rescue the Asgardian children and defeat Gorr with Zeus's army. Thor doesn't understand that fighting a war is easy, but battling for love will kill.<br/><br/>During the opening credits, viewers get a glimpse into the battles of the Asgardians of the Galaxy. This film adds insight into the past while giving hints to the overarching antagonist of these MCU phases. So keep your eyes open. Let's not forget that the script introduces us to more Young Avengers. The movie is off-the-charts with well-crafted CGI and flawless fight choreography. During the Shadow Realm fight scene, the contrast of the black and white world with the color from the clashing weapons is worth the 3D price. Unlike other Thor movies, this film gives the characters a satisfying and heart-warming conclusion. And stick around for two post-credit scenes that offer a new villain and a new life.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Minions: The Rise of Gru",
    "review":"It's career day in 1976, and while some kids dream of being doctors and lawyers, Gru dreams of joining The Vicious Six and becoming a super villain. The Vicious Six members are Belle Bottom, Jean Clawed, Nunchuck, Svengence, and Stronghold, and their leader is Wild Knuckles, Gru's hero. The Vicious Six accepted his application and wants Gru to interview for a spot on their team at Criminal Records tomorrow.<br/><br/>Gru doesn't know that The Vicious Six is looking for a new member because they turned on Wild Knuckles during their last heist. Wild Knuckles risked his life inside a temple to get the stone. The stone will give someone the power of a Chinese zodiac animal on the Chinese New Year. Instead of saving him, Belle Bottom grabs the stone and pushes Wild Knuckles off the plane. With Wild Knuckles dead, they need a new member to complete their team and use the stone to destroy the Anti-Villain League.<br/><br/>In the interview, Gru tells The Vicious Six that he is despicable and ready to join. Awestruck by Gru's age, they tell Gru no and to go to school. During another interviewee's questions, Gru sneaks around The Vicious Six and gets the stone. With The Vicious Six on his tail, Gru gives the stone to his minion, Otto, to take to their lair. They get away and meet with Otto at the hideout. Gru plans to return the stone to The Vicious Six, so they will accept him. Gru asks Otto for the stone, and Otto gives Gru a pet rock. On the way, Otto saw a birthday party, and the birthday boy got a pet rock. Otto fell in love with it and traded it for the stone. Gru walks out to find it, and Kevin sees someone kidnap Gru.<br/><br/>The kidnappers let Gru out of the bag, and Gru sees Wild Knuckles in front of him. Surprised to see Wild Knuckles alive, Gru hands him the pet rock instead of the stone. Wild Knuckles hangs Gru off a balcony and makes a ransom call to the minions. The Vicious Six still think Gru has the stone. Can the Minions save Gru and get the stone?<br/><br/>This movie has something for the entire family, from the opening credits to the mid-credits scene. The soundtrack will have you dancing in your seat with 70's funk, rock, and disco. The storyline is complex but not entirely original. Although the minions don't articulate well, the animators gave them spot-on non-verbal communication. The plot provides a training montage with Master Chow for an easy but fulfilling laugh. See this one in theaters, but 3D isn't necessary.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
