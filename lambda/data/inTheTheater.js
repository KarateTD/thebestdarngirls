	"review":"Sara is the favourite of Queen Anne but that's challenged when her cousin Abagail becomes Sara's maid.  This back and forth between the too women is as sad as it is compelling.  It's hard to believe that people still fight to be the favourite of those in power today.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
