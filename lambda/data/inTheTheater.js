    "review":"Elizabeth, better known as Bea, temporarily moves in with her grandmother during her father's treatment. For Bea, this brings back memories of when she lost her mother. Her mother encouraged her to tell stories, perform, and play make-believe. Her dad does the same with his joyful attitude.<br/><br/>After visiting her dad, Bea sees a young girl running in the hallway. Bea chases after her, but the girl runs into the top-floor apartment. Bea knocks, and a man answers without opening the door. The man answers that no girl lives there.<br/><br/>Bea finds an old camcorder and plays the tape inside. It's a recording of happier times with her mother. Then she sees the man and girl outside her window. Bea follows them down the street and watches the man enter a brownstone. Inside the home, the man, Cal, asks Blue to come out of the closet. Outside, Bea sees Blue's large purple hand open the bedroom window. She turns in disbelief and sees the girl from the apartment. But she is not human. Bea faints.<br/><br/>Bea wakes up in Cal's apartment, and the 'girl,' Blossom, makes Bea tea. Blue explains that they are IF, an acronym for Imaginary Friend. The kids that manifested them grew up. Cal is a matchmaker of sorts. He is helping them find new kids to match with. Bea gets an idea. They will locate the kids who created them as adults now. If they can get the adults to remember them, maybe they'll save the IFs. Bea, who tries to be an adult, will discover the beauty in fun and imagination.<br/><br/>This film is an astounding, heartfelt story that asks, 'What IF.' Viewers must catch this movie from the beginning. The script delivers the lovely relationship between Bea and her parents in a montage. Seeing the IFs helps Bea find joy in having fun again. The script shows the audience the importance of Imaginary Friends then and now. And the score will make your heart swell with excitement. You will want the DVD to uncover what they left on the cutting room floor. If you saw this movie, don't ruin the twist. But adults may see it coming.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Amy Winehouse admires her grandmother, Cynthia. Cynthia believes her Amy will be one of the greats. After celebrating with her father's family, her dad, Mitch, drives Amy home. She invites him inside to spend time with her mother, but he won't go in. Amy rages as she walks into the house and puts her feelings into her guitar.<br/><br/>After playing a successful gig, Amy gets a phone call from her manager, Nick. Nick scores Amy a deal with Island Records, and they record her debut album, Frank. It charts well, and Island Records executives think she's ready to cross the pond. However, they want to change her look and make her put down the guitar. Amy tells them off, leaves the meeting, and runs into a local pub. She drinks at the bar when Blake walks in and charms her. Amy falls madly in love until he leaves with another woman. She cures her troubles with alcohol. Later, Amy creates another masterpiece that will catapult her career as love and other drugs will be her downfall.<br/><br/>This movie is one hour too long. Amy Winehouse's writers gave her the Whitney Houston treatment. Instead of a story with Blake as a footnote, they make him the focal point while attempting to absolve him of responsibility. The script gives the audience a few of Amy's inspirations for her music, style, and tattoos. If you see this movie, focus on what Amy wanted instead of the drama the writers push.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes",
    "review":"A human-made virus increased apes' intelligence and gave them the ability to speak, but it did the opposite for humans. One of the apes led them to prosperity. His name was Caesar, but he died many generations ago. Today, the Eagle Clan is a close-knit group that will celebrate the bonding ceremony at sunrise. Noa, urged by his mother, runs to his father, Koro, with his eagle egg. Koro is proud but smells a unique scent on Noa's blanket. Noa admits an Echo - their name for a human - took his blanket, but Noa retrieved it. Koro demands to know if Noa went into the valley. Noa truthfully says no.<br/><br/>Noa catches an odor coming from a tent and investigates. He finds a female Echo hiding inside and scares it away. The Echo charges past him and breaks his egg. He needs it for the ceremony. So, he travels into the forest to get a new one. He hears the Coastal Clan riding on their horses and hides. They see Noa's horse in the woods, shock it, and follow it to the Eagle Clan.<br/><br/>Noa hurries home to warn the others, but it's too late. Proximus, leader of the Coastal Clan, had his army attack the Eagle clan and take them prisoner. Noa wakes up in the morning. The Coastal Clan killed Koro and stole the Eagle Clan. Noa travels through the valley and vows to bring them back. Noa will learn the truth about Caesar, the Echos, and Proximus's greatest desire. Proximus is hunting the female Echo because she is the key to the evolution of his Kingdom of Apes.<br/><br/>This latest Planet of the Apes installment has mesmerizing graphics, heart-warming laughs, and a captivating storyline. The plot slows when Noa uncovers Promxius's plan and meets Raka. Don't get confused. This film occurs several generations after Caesar died. One thing Apes and Humans want is knowledge. It's the key to their survival, but can they coexist? This plot point is the movie's standout. Planet fans should keep their eyes and ears open for a few easter eggs. And there aren't any post-credit scenes, but the movie leaves room for another film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Not Another Church Movie",
    "review":"TV Host Hoprah Windfall wants to pass the torch and find someone to inspire women worldwide. So, she calls God for help. God chooses Taylor Pharry - pronounced Harry - to be the one. He tells Taylor to write a play that will become a national sensation.<br/><br/>Taylor is a doctor, lawyer, entrepreneur, and food delivery man. He helped his cousin, Ellen, divorce her husband, Darnell. He knew Darnell would make the divorce difficult, so he called his Aunt Madude to help.<br/><br/>Later, Taylor's friend, Julie, calls because she needs a new driver. He calls his cousin, Monte Carlo, to assist. Monte has three little girls and could use the extra income. God reminds Taylor to write a play. However, Taylor can't come up with an idea. God tells Taylor to use his family. Taylor considers writing about his cousin, Bethany. Her absent father put Bethany in his will. Taylor needs to be careful. Whenever God has a plan, the Devil finds a way to destroy it.<br/><br/>This parody movie ties all the plotlines you know into one film. However, those plotlines don't have a solution. It's stories Taylor will write later to become a famous playwright and media mogul. While the movie pokes fun at church film clich√©s, it doesn't produce many laughs. After the credits, they ask the audience to share it. But don't feel obligated because viewers can wait for this movie to come to cable.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Abigail",
    "review":"Abigail finishes her ballet practice and gets into her chauffeured vehicle. She settles for the night. Then, three masked intruders jump out and pounce on the child. Two hold her down while another injects Abigail with a sedative.<br/><br/>They arrive at their destination and put Abigail into a bedroom. The negotiator, Lambert, tells them to keep Abigail alive for 24 hours while he extorts her father for money. One of the kidnappers asks what they should call each other if they can't exchange names. So, Lambert gives them code names. The sedative injector is Joey. The hacker is Sammy, while the muscle is Peter. Dean is the driver, and Rickles is the weapons expert. Frank rounds out the crew with his short temper. Lambert reminds everyone that Joey is the only person allowed to communicate with Abigail and leaves.<br/><br/>Joey visits Abigail. Abigail fears they will hurt her, but Joey pinky-promises they won't. Then, Abigail warns Joey they made a mistake. Abigail says her father doesn't care about her.<br/><br/>The team splits for the night, and Dean goes to the kitchen. Then, something grabs and decapitates him. Sammy finds Dean's body and screams. Frank barges into Abigail's room and demands her father's name. Frank runs to the team and panics because Abigail's father is Kristof Lazar. Rickles knows the lore surrounding the legendary crimelord and decides to leave. Then, something kills Rickles. Frank wants to kill Abigail. He runs to her room with a gun, but Joey stops him after remembering her pinky promise. While they argue, Sammy notices Abigail remove her restraints with ease. Then Abigail transforms into a dancing vampire. She is Kristof's hitwoman, and she will make them pay. Can they survive?<br/><br/>This movie is a bloody, funny mystery with a brilliant ensemble. It's not a traditional horror movie, but it provides entertaining jump scares. The script takes a while to reveal Abigail's powers. It's necessary because it allows the viewers to connect with each character. While the crew makes typical horror mistakes, they get some actions correct. If you like M3GAN, this film is for you.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
