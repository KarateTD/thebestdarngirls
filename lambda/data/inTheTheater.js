    "review": "Chris Lemons spends time with his fianc√©e, Morag, planning paint colors for their baby's room. Morag expresses concern about Chris's job as a saturation diver, but Chris thinks it's cool. He reassures Morag that everything is okay before driving to Aberdeen Harbour. Chris greets friends on the ship and learns from fellow diver Duncan that they have a new Captain. Then, teammates tell Chris that 'Vulcan' is joining them on this dive. The divers meet with their coordinator, Craig. Craig divides the divers into four teams of three. Duncan, Chris, and the 'Vulcan' - whose name is Dave - are on team A..<br/><br/>The men spend time in the pod while the crew pressurizes it to prepare for their dive. After some time, each team makes the dive in their pod. They will take turns repairing the gas pipeline. They dive, and Craig chooses Team A to go to the subsea manifold first. Chris and Dave will dive while Duncan monitors their umbilical cables and air levels from above. Duncan opens the hatch, and the water rushes inside. He knows it's a sign of a 20-foot swell above. Craig confirms Duncan's suspicions, but the team continues.<br/><br/>While Chris and Dave work on the manifold, they don't know what's happening above until the umbilical cable retracts without Duncan's assistance. The thrusters on the ship failed, and the vessel, connected to their pod, drifts further into the sea. Dave and Chris climb the manifold as the ship pulls. Then, Chris's umbilical cable snags on the manifold. Duncan warns Chris that his cable will snap under the strain. Knowing that the vessel will pull him before he can help Chris, Dave tells Chris to climb the manifold after the cable breaks. He can't save Chris if he can't find him. His cable breaks. Chris falls, and the ship pulls Dave away. Dave rejoins a somber Duncan. They can't rescue Chris until the vessel stops drifting. Chris has 10 minutes of air before he dies. Can the vessel's crew stop the drift so Dave and Duncan can return to save Chris?<br/><br/>Based on the Last Breath documentary, this movie only gives the audience a brief moment to understand the characters and their work. However, it's enough to have you waiting with bated breath as they count down Chris's air supply. Your heart will drop when the countdown changes from time with air to time without it. The camera work doesn't make you the diver but turns you into a fish in the ocean. You swim around the divers while they work and struggle. This film will take you through a roller coaster of emotions without crass humor. This film is a must-see in theaters.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Scott gets help from his imaginary friend, Joe, to work up the courage to ask out a beautiful woman, Teresa, who works at the store. Scott can't take his eyes off Teresa's striking blue eyes. She accepts but notices he keeps items in a straight line and evenly taps his feet. Three dates later, Teresa is pregnant with their first child. However, she admits she's worried. Teresa has osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, and it's genetic. Scott reassures Teresa the baby will be fine.<br/><br/>Scott and Teresa have their son, Austin, who they lovingly call Auz-man. After Auz-man suffers his first break, nurses and doctors discover he has osteogenesis imperfecta. A few years later, Scott and Teresa have another son named Logan. Logan's birth spotlighted the differences between Logan and Auz-man. They have Auz-man tested and discover he has autism. Auz-man's surmounting bills and mood swings become unpredictable. Scott talks to Joe about his fathering ability. As Scott questions himself, he turns to a vice to feel better.

    "review": "Joey wakes up to angry text messages from her boss, Derek. She's late for work again. She gets a call from her brother's placement center as she walks to her bike. Her brother, Michael, hacked into their files and posted them online. Joey rushes to the facility and begs for them to let Michael stay. They say no. Joey tells Michael to come with her. They arrive at Agnine Energy building. Joey asks the security guard to look after Michael.<br/><br/>Joey runs to Derek's office. He tells Joey they have a dead bird on the 51st floor. Window washers, Joey and her co-worker, Noah, repel down the side of the Agnine building. Noah says they must finish early because Agnine's CEOs, Gerald and Geoffery Milton, have a party for the company's VIPs. He ascends while Joey finishes. Joey tries to leave, but Derek knows she didn't get the dead bird. He sends the cage to escort her to the proper floor.<br/><br/>Inside, the party starts, but the entertainment is late. Geoffery decides to give his speech before they arrive. During the speech, his brother Gerald leaves with his girlfriend of the week and goes to his penthouse apartment several floors up. During Geoffery's speech, masked people enter, and everyone assumes they are the entertainment. Until they interrupt Geoffery and the tumblers spray gas. Everyone in the room passes out, and the company's elites get a breathing apparatus to help them regain consciousness. The leader, Marcus, takes off his mask. He demands they make a video confession of everything they have done. He will release everything on the internet and watch them all burn.<br/><br/>Marcus realizes that Gerald is missing and sends a goon for him. The goon brings Gerald back and sits him with the other alert hostages. Then, Geoffery and Marcus argue. The goon rages and attacks Geoffery by shoving a champagne bottle down his throat and killing him. Gerald tries to escape, but Marcus and the goon follow. They find Gerald in his penthouse but don't see Joey outside, looking in. As Marcus monologues, the goon shoots him. Joey can see the goon's face. It's Noah. He surmises that humans are a plague on the world and to heal the world, they must remove the virus. Then he sees Joey outside in the cage. He deduces she stayed for Michael. He tells his culprits to bring Joey up and find Michael. He will ensure they die with everyone else. Before Noah completes his evil plan, can Joey save everyone, including Michael?<br/><br/>This movie has an intriguing plot, but it's not original. It's a mix of Skyscraper, The Beekeeper, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's the ordinary person with a bland job and a secret combat background. The camera angle on the cage lets you understand the danger Joey faces while outside. Anyone with motion sickness or a fear of heights may want to skip this movie. Most fight scenes are close combat and balance humor with savageness, but an eagle-eye viewer can spot the stunt doubles. This piece isn't a glamor movie with unnecessary sexual innuendoes. It's a kill-or-be-killed film. Viewers should consider seeing this in theaters to appreciate the high camera angles.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Thaddeus Ross is the president-elect. However, the American people can't forget his time as a General who took on the Hulk and lost. Ross knows the American people see him as an unhinged man but vows to be better as the President.<br/><br/>Six months later, Captain America Sam Wilson has orders to intercept the sale of a canister stolen from the Japanese government. Joaquin Torres asks for the canister's contents, but the government has marked the details as classified. Sam takes down Sidewinder but thinks it's strange that the buyer never came and the meeting place is so open. Joaquin wants to learn some of Sam's best moves. He decides to take Joaquin to the man who trains him.<br/><br/>Sam and Joaquin go to Baltimore to train with Isaiah Bradley. Ross calls Sam during the session and invites Sam and Joaquin to the Celestial Island World Summit. Sam agrees, but only if Isaiah gets an invitation.<br/><br/>Sam, Joaquin, and Isaiah enter the summit, and Agent Leila Taylor pulls Sam aside because President Ross wants to talk privately. Ross wants Sam to restart the Avengers. Ross believes working together will instill American's faith in him and the Avengers. He gives Sam time to think about it.<br/><br/>President Ross speaks at the summit to introduce an element stronger and more versatile than Vibranium. The Celestial Island is 100% Adamantium. Then, Isaiah and several members of the Secret Service stand and take shots at the President. Isaiah escapes, but the military police and Agent Ruth Bat-Seraph find him. Sam catches up to Isaiah, unaware of what he did, and begs Isaiah to give himself up. Sam promises to figure out what happened.<br/><br/>Sam visits Isaiah and asks Isaiah to recount the night's events. Isaiah mentions his phone glitching. Sam remembers his friend falling under mind control and thinks Isaiah and the other shooters are victims. Sam tells President Ross, but Ross won't free Isaiah because it will negatively impact his presidency and the Adamantium agreement. Sam thinks Isaiah is a puppet and that the puppet master has a plan for world devastation. Can Sam prove Isaiah's innocence and force Ross's hand before they convict Sam and cause World War III?<br/><br/>This latest installment in Marvel's Phase Five introduces new characters while reaching back to older ones within a mystery. It has hallmarks of Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. It provides easter eggs for future movies with a fan-favorite cameo. While the story is compelling, it moves too fast. The fight scenes offered something different because Sam doesn't have the serum. With Sam's wings and the shield, the choreographers and graphic artists had new material to use. This fun, new element didn't stop poor focus work. The dialog allowed itself to be funny, introspective, and combative. However, it missed a critical moment. This film is what Thor 2 was to Phase Two. It doesn't make the most sense now. But it will tie things together later. This film is for matinee Marvel fans who will stay for the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Realtor Marvin bakes cookies before riding his bike to his next house showing. Marvin's assistant, Ashley, calls to remind Marvin about the office Valentine's Day party.<br/><br/>After the house showing, Marvin arrives with leftover heart-shaped cookies for the staff. He opens a red envelope with a note saying Rose is back. Dumbfounded, Marvin asks Ashley to give him some alone time in his office. Marvin walks through the door and wakes up. Marvin lifts his head to see assassin Raven sitting on the couch reading poetry. Raven only has one question for Marvin: where's Rose? Marvin says he doesn't know and fights. He asks Cliff to borrow his car and drives home.<br/><br/>Marvin quickly bags clothes and money. Then, hitmen King and Otis break in and attack. They want to know why Marvin didn't kill Rose as Marvin's brother, Knuckles, instructed. Years ago, Rose was Knuckle's accountant and kept his dirty money clean. However, Knuckles discovered she stole $4,000,000 from him. Marvin took the hit because Marvin secretly loved Rose. He told her to hide and never return. Marvin did the same. Marvin escapes Otis and King, but Rose shocks Marvin with a stun gun before he makes it to Cliff's car.<br/><br/>Marvin wakes up with a new shirt in the back of a club. He finds Rose serving drinks at the bar. She is tired of hiding because 'hiding ain't living.' Rose found information to prove she didn't steal Knuckle's money. So she sent Valentine's Day cards to Knuckles and everyone in his inner circle to announce her return. She wants Marvin to reclaim his hitman life, end Knuckle's crew, and control the empire. However, Marvin is happy with his new life. With Rose announcing her return, Knuckles wants his goons to bring them to him alive. What path will Marvin choose, and will he live to see it?<br/><br/>This film is a Valentine's Day movie that has something for everyone. It has true love, betrayal, and violence. The highly choreographed fights will remind the audience of Kill Bill. The director used interesting point-of-view angles from inanimate objects. However, the cuts make the stunt doubles and wire work obvious while taking away from the cinematography. The writers used the holiday to inject some much-needed humor into the script. While the film has flaws, it will entertain you and become your go-to Valentine's Day movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
