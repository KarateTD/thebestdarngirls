    "review":"Priscilla Beaulieu sits at a German malt shop studying as Officer Terry West asks her if she is a fan of Elvis Presley. Terry books the music acts on base and considers Elvis a friend. He invites Priscilla to his home to meet the singer. Priscilla warns Terry to check with her father, Captain Beaulieu, before she can go.<br/><br/>Captain Beaulieu and Ann both say no. Officer Terry approaches the family when they go out to dinner. He convinces the Captain and Ann to let Priscilla go for a night out. Elvis sits next to her and inquires about her age. Priscilla is in the 9th grade, and Elvis is 23-years-old. They continue talking and meeting for months until Elvis gets his orders to return to the States. Elvis called her in 1961. He is ready for Priscilla to visit him at Graceland.<br/><br/>Elvis introduces Priscilla to his family and friends. Priscilla is excited to see him again and can't sleep. So, Elvis gives her a pill to calm her. Then, he invites her on a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas. With the pills to help, they party and gamble all night. Priscilla begs to stay, but Elvis knows she must return to Germany.<br/><br/>Captain Beaulieu and Ann barely recognize their daughter when she disembarks the plane. However, Priscilla will do anything to be with the man she loves. Elvis calls the Captain with an offer. He will care for Priscilla and ensure she finishes her high school education. Priscilla believes this is the beginning of a new, exciting life with the most loving man in the world. Instead, she moves into a golden cage of control, manipulation, and affairs.<br/><br/>Based on Elvis and Me by Priscilla Presley, this movie is a lesson on red flags. Priscilla states they were not physical until marriage. However, Elvis told her what to wear and where to go and picked her friends. Priscilla didn't understand that his care was control. The film has several montages of Priscilla being bored. Unfortunately, it has the same effect on the audience. The costumes and iconic images are spot-on recreations, but it's not enough for viewers to see it in theaters. Save this one for streaming.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, Dar-Benn watched The Annihilator tear down the Supreme Intelligence to free the Kree. However, the Kree broke into a civil war and destroyed their air, water, and sun. Supremor Dar-Benn finds one of the Universal Bands, but the other is missing. She uses her Universal Weapon to charge the Band and rips open a jump point through space.<br/><br/>Nick Fury watches Monica Rambeau fix satellites from the SABER space station. He calls Carol Danvers after getting an anomaly alert from sector MB-814. He asks Carol to check things out. Carol flies to MB-814 and finds an open jump point with a strange hue. She walks towards it and touches the swirling light.<br/><br/>Monica Rambeau notices a strange glow around the earth's atmosphere as she works on the satellite. Monica floats to the atmosphere to get a better look. She activates her powers and sees a new light spectrum. She reaches out to touch it, and it wraps around her fingers.<br/><br/>Kamala Khan can't focus on her homework because her head is in the clouds. She writes Captain Marvel fan fiction and dreams of meeting her hero. Then, she sees her bangle glowing. She reaches to touch it. Carol ends up in Kamala's place, Kamala switches with Monica, and Monica ends up on MB-814. Dar-Benn's disruption of the jump points caused a quantum entanglement. It's better to stay together until they can stabilize their swaps.<br/><br/>Kamala joins Carol and Monica on Carol's ship. Dar-Benn's first target is Tarnax, a Skrull refugee colony. Dar-Benn plans to create a jump point that's large enough to steal Tarnax's atmosphere for Hala and reestablish their air supply. Kamala, Carol, and Monica get to Tarnax but can't stop Dar-Benn. Carol admits that she is The Annihilator, and Dar-Benn will destroy every place Carol calls home to save Hala and get revenge. Can The Marvels stop her before Dar-Benn ends two more planets?<br/><br/>This film is a pure superhero team-up movie. If that plot bores you, then this film isn't for you. Monica and Carol have unfinished business from her childhood. Kamala learns that being a superhero requires making difficult decisions and sacrifices. When Carol gets heavy-handed with Kamala, Monica ensures they take a breath and listen to each other. It helps to watch Captain Marvel, Avengers: Infinity Wars, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel.<br/><br/>This movie has wall-to-wall action with poignant and funny moments to break up the script. Kamala's family, Goose, and Nick Fury will never fail to deliver. However, this movie heavily focuses on the action to drive the story. It's an enjoyable movie with Flerkens, fighting, dancing, and a princess that delivers what you expect with a few future nuggets.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"William 'Bill' Davis looks around the airport for information about his connection but can't find it. As he looks for a power outlet for his phone, he sees Willamina 'Willa' Davis in the distance and tries to avoid her.<br/><br/>Willa is connecting to her fl ight, heading to Boston. She deplanes without her connecting gate but can't find anyone to help her. So, Willa tries to look up the information on her phone. She sees Bill across the way and tries to run, but they make eye contact.<br/><br/>Bill and Willa were college sweethearts. After 25 years, Bill is married with a child, and Willa is a free spirit. They decide to separate, but the weather delays their flights again. Willa believes the magic of the leap day is in control, but he says it's a coincidence. With their airport shutdown, these exes will have all night to work out their pasts and futures.<br/><br/>This film belongs on streaming. It's boring, whiny, and anticlimactic. Based on the play Shooting Star by Steven Dietz, the plot is for the stage, not the big screen. The best advice is to skip this film until it's free and you need a good nap.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars",

    "review":"Mason Pettits always wanted to help people as a child, so he became a lawyer. He became disenchanted with the predictability of his life and job. So, he left the law and joined the special forces. Now, his life has a purpose until his last mission. His commanding officer, Sebastian, passed his team the dossier of President Juan Venegas, their next target. Mason abseils from the helicopter and watches someone shoot it down. . Mason returns to law with his purple heart, wife, and daughter by his side. Then, Mason's past walks through the door. Sebastian owns CDI, a security company. He wants to hire Mason to protect an investigative journalist, Claire Wellington. She has an exclusive interview with Juan. Sebastion offers Mason $20,000, and he agrees.<br/><br/>Claire won a Peabody award but fell to disgrace after people discovered her source lied. So she resigned. She hopes interviewing the President of Paldonia will reinvigorate her career.<br/><br/>Juan meets Claire and Mason on the tarmac. Juan and Claire converse and drink in the car while ignoring Mason in the back seat. Then, the car in front blows up. Mason gets Claire and Juan to safety. Mason calls Sebastian to arrange their extraction. Juan calls his nephew, General Jorge, and lets Jorge know he is safe. After Juan hangs up, he tells Mason that Jorge arranged the attack. Juan wants to travel to a neighboring town to do the interview, but Mason says no. He wants to leave with his client, Claire.<br/><br/>They wait in the clearing until their transport descends. However, two armed mercenaries come out, and the helicopter flies away. Mason shoots the helicopter out of the sky. The two mercenaries follow Claire, but Mason takes one of them out. Juan shoots the other and tells Mason that Mason is a pawn in a bigger game. Someone purposely picked Mason to kill Juan and help ignite the coup. Mason decides to help Juan and Claire escape the jungle alive, stop the coup, and restart Claire's career.<br/><br/>The opening scene is interesting because it gives the audience Mason's life through his eyes. Then, the script gets funny, so you don't take the shooting and killing too seriously. Juan is an intriguing character. He lives his life with the motto, 'Failing to plan is planning to fail.' He is amusingly charming but extremely intelligent. Sadly, the script uses an unnecessary seduction scene to make the respectable reporter nothing more than a typical vixen. The viewers know Mason loves his wife, so rejecting Claire is pointless. Save this movie for streaming on a slow day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his Uncle William's cattle ranch. William King Hale, called King, offers Ernest a job running a cab but suggests there is more than one way to make money. The Osage people found oil on their land and had the final say on who could drill for a monthly payment. While they have wealth, the government won't let them access the money without a white guardian. And that guardian can be a spouse.<br/><br/>Ernest sees Mollie leave a store and offers her a ride. She accepts but doesn't take his proffered hand. Mollie and Ernest fall in love after several rides. Ernest tells King he wants to marry Mollie, and King tells him about headrights. Ernest can live off her monthly payments and inherit them if Mollie dies.<br/><br/>Mollie lives with her mother and looks after her sisters, Anna, Rita, and Minnie. Minnie is married to Bill Smith, but she has a wasting disease. Over the years, Mollie notes uninvestigated murders throughout the Osage nation. And she blames the strange new faces around her for the deaths. Her blame doesn't shift when Minnie dies. King sits on the porch and tells Ernest that it's a shame that Minnie's money will go to Bill, not Minnie's surviving family. Under the right circumstances, all the family's wealth could be Mollie's. And in turn, Ernest's. Mollie offers a reward and hires an investigator after someone murders Anna. King sits in the circle and adds $1,000 to Mollie's reward. Mollie's efforts will help create the modern-day FBI and uncover corruption, greed, and evil hidden within their nation.<br/><br/>Based on Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, this movie is tragically breathtaking. It respects the Osage Nation by correctly using the nation's language, writing, and traditions. The clothing, technology, and conclusion were within the era. However, the film jumps around the timeline without any explanation. This film will begin a deeper conversation about history, heritage, genocide, and greed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
