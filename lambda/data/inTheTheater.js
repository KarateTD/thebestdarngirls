    "mtitle":"House Party",
    "review":"Kevin is a single father living with his parents. They plan to retire soon and sell the house. So they remind Kevin that he needs to find a new place to live. He works for a cleaning service, but it doesn't pay enough for Kevin to find a new home. Kevin loads his daughter, Destiny, in the car when three men, YTD, pull up and threaten him. They are upset because Kevin's friend, Damon, stole their cousin's chain during a party.<br/><br/>Damon lives with his aunt, but she's threatening to throw him out if he doesn't pay his rent on time. He promotes parties on his social media to attract more attendees. She asks how much he gets paid, and he doesn't. She reminds Damon that partying without pay is partying. Damon leaves to join Kevin at work.<br/><br/>Damon arrives at the cleaning job at a huge mansion, but no one will say who owns the home. Kevin tells Damon he needs $10,000 to pay for Destiny's school and get a place. Then Kevin tells Damon that YTD fired them and questions Damon about the chain. Damon denies taking the chain but wants to throw a party. Then, Kevin's high school crush, manager Venus, calls. The last client has a video of Damon and Kevin manhandling statues and doing drugs on the property. Venus tells Kevin that the boss will fire them on Monday.<br/><br/>After Damon looks around the home, he discovers it belongs to LeBron James. After listening to Kevin's woes, Damon thinks they can make the money they need in one night. They can give the boss fake keys after cleaning, charge a premium for the party, party, clean up, and return the real keys without anyone noticing. This party will put their promotion business on the map. Easy enough, right?<br/><br/>This reboot references the original material and has some of the main cast for fans of the cult classic. The script starts funny and gets crazy. However, the plot gets extremely weird. It becomes unnecessarily violent and bloody and turns into a mix of The Lovebirds and Gladiator. Finally, the movie jumps to its original plot and provides comical and caring moments. This disturbing sequence was unneeded with the slew of cameos, a koala, and plenty of damage. This film is for fans looking for something new, not a blast from the past.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Plane",
    "review":"Captain Brodie Torrance prepares his crew to fly from Singapore to Hawaii on Trailblazer 119. Brodie talks to the flight crew before loading the passengers. There will be 14 passengers, three flight attendants, and the co-pilot, Samuel Dele, on the flight.<br/><br/>Samuel looks at the Doppler report and sees the flight plan has them going through a storm. Brodie asks the Trailblazer rep if they can fly around it. The rep believes the storm will be over once they get there and says no. Fight attendant Bonnie walks into the cockpit as the rep leaves. She informs Brodie that RCMP Officer Knight wants to talk to him about a passenger. Officer Knight will use the flight to transport a prisoner, Louis Gaspere, back for a murder charge.<br/><br/>The plane takes off without issue, and the attendants make their rounds. They hit the storm and tell the passengers to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts. Lightning strikes the plane and takes out the electrical system. Brodie and Samuel fly blind and without communication with air traffic control. Brodie fears he needs to make a water landing but sees land on the way down.<br/><br/>Brodie breathes a sigh of relief when they land on the remote island but knows it will be a while before help can find them. Samuel thinks it will be longer because he discovered they are in Jolo. Jolo has no police, and criminals and separatists run the island and population. Brodie remembers seeing a structure on the way down. He hopes it will have a phone. When two passengers volunteer, Brodie lies and says Louis asked to go. Brodie hopes to signal for help. However, a villager spotted the plane going down and told Datu. Datu runs the local gang and orders his men to find the aircraft to collect supplies and hostages. Landing the plane was only half the battle.<br/><br/>If you watch the trailers, you will anticipate the crazy moments. But don't let that distract you from the setup. Every ounce of the beginning is necessary for the plot. Also, you get an insight into crisis management. This movie will make you wait with bated breath until you know everyone is safe. You won't have the urge to buy this movie, but you won't regret seeing it in the theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Man Called Otto",
    "review":"Otto wakes up, goes to the hardware store, checks on the neighborhood, and goes to work. His co-workers surprise Otto with a retirement party. Otto scoffs at the Dyn and Merika signs for the new condos. The realtors are trying to entice Otto and his neighbors to sell, but they remain firm.<br/><br/>After Otto's neighborhood checks, he helps his new neighbor, Marisol, and her husband, Tommy, and their two daughters parallel park their moving trailer. Otto cancels his utilities, anchors a rope to the ceiling, and hangs himself. Otto sees visions of his late wife, Sonya, as he slips away, but the metal ring breaks before he dies. Otto isn't happy to be alive. Instead, he is upset that you can't find decent material these days. Otto doesn't see the point of living without Sonya, and Otto will try again to end it. However, the neighborhood he pushed away will unknowingly come to his rescue, and he theirs.<br/><br/>Based on A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman and a remake of A Man Called Ove, this movie weaves humor and sadness expertly. Otto is a grumpy, older man screaming at the changing of the times in the beginning. However, you get to know his story during each attempt. Otto's cantankerous behavior is valid, although misdirected. If you cried at the beginning of Up, be prepared to have your tissues ready. This film will stay with you.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"M3GAN",
    "review":"Gemma created the latest toy craze, PurrPetual Pets. But her boss, David, wants her to make a new model at a lower price. Instead of working on the updated Pet, Gemma and her team, Tess and Cole, keep working on the Model 3 Generative Android, M3gan, for short. Gemma tries a simple demo, but the doll's face melts. David leaves the room enraged and demands Gemma scrap M3gan and begin working on a cheaper Pet. Then Gemma gets a phone call from the hospital in Oregon. Her sister, Ava, and brother-in-law, Ryan, died in a car accident, but their daughter, Cady, survived.<br/><br/>Gemma moves Cady into her home but doesn't have toys, books, or a dedicated space for Cady. Cady comes into Gemma's workshop and shows Gemma her drawings. So, Gemma shows Cady a robot she made in college, Bruce. It's a motion caption robot using gloves to interact. Cady comments that it's a cool toy and the only one she would ever need. Gemma, Tess, and Cole work overtime to fix M3gan.<br/><br/>They invite David to a private meeting and have him watch M3gan interact with Cady. David loves M3gan and wants to present it to the board immediately. Gemma thinks the bond will help Cady recover after losing her parents, allow her to work, and put her company at number one. She wants Cady to be happy, the same as M3gan. Only M3gan will kill for it because Gemma forgot rule number one of toy designing: parental controls.<br/><br/>While Chucky starts creepy, M3gan is a lifesize Barbie on steroids. In true Blumhouse fashion, this script is funny, scary, and twisted. And it sets itself apart from other AI and doll movies because it discusses attachment theory. Cady becomes frighteningly dependent on M3gan and physically attacks Gemma when she can't have M3gan. While we are nowhere near this level of AI, Cady's misplaced attachment is the real threat in society today. Audiences will cringe, laugh, and OMG as M3gan takes over. This film is definitely worth a watch and discussion.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Babylon",
    "review":"Manny worked odd jobs in LA in 1926. He got an elephant to studio executive Don Wallach's party and helped keep tabs on attendees. Manny's boss tells him to ignore Elinor St. John because she is a gossip journalist. Sidney Palmer plays the trumpet with his band while avoiding the depravity around him. Lady Fay Zhu performs a song and picks a beautiful woman in the audience to kiss. Manny takes a smoke break and sees a woman, Nellie, crash into a statue. Manny pretends to know Nellie and sneaks her into the mansion. Someone pulls Manny aside because a woman, Jane Thorton, overdosed, and they want to get her out without the other partygoers knowing. Manny's boss remembers that Jane has to be on the movie set at 8 am. There is no way Jane will be ready on time, so the boss runs to the ballroom, spots Nellie wildly dancing, and chooses Nellie to replace Jane. Outside, actor Jack Conrad gets into an argument with his wife, and she leaves him at the mansion. Jack walks in and orders every alcohol on the menu.<br/><br/>Manny wakes up in a mansion filled with trash and unconscious bodies. His boss tells him to take Jack home because he is too drunk to drive. After getting Jack comfortable, Jack hires Manny to be his assistant on set, and Manny accepts. He returns to the mansion to find Nellie leaving in the stolen car she crashed the night before. He declares his love for her, and Nellie drives away to her first acting gig. Hollywood will bring out the best and worst in all, but one change will redirect the course of their careers: sound in movies.<br/><br/>Most viewers today don't understand the complexity of making a silent film. This movie shows every step of filming, lighting, stunts, and painting words for the screen. Next, the audience will see Hollywood's difficulties after pivoting to talking films. This movie spends most of its time tearing Hollywood apart, but the last 5 minutes are a love letter to everything it accomplished. While the movie is fun, it's far too long. The editor could cut an hour out of the film and tell the same story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
