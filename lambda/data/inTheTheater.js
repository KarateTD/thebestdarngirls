    "review":"Professor Sersi enters her classroom to take over for her makeshift substitute and boyfriend, Dane.  In the middle of class, there is a small earthquake that worries Sersi.  Later, Dane and Sersi go out with Sersi's young companion, Sprite. Dane tries to understand her rejection when a creature comes out of the ground and attacks Sersi.  As Sersi and Sprite fight back, Ikaris enters and helps them fight the beast.  When they defeat the creature, Sersi explains to Dane her true origin.  She and her friends are Eternals from a planet called Olympia.  The Celestial Arishem sent them to Earth with superpowers to defeat the Deviants, creatures sent to destroy all human life. Sersi believed they killed all the Deviants 1500 years ago.  But she was wrong.  And Sersi and Sprite notice the Deviant has increased strength and could heal itself, like their mentor Ajak. They enter Ajak's home in South Dakota but can't find her.  But they discover her dead in the backyard because a Deviant killed her and sucked out her healing powers.<br/><br/>Soon a sphere comes out of Ajak and into the Sersi because Ajak chose Sersi to lead the Eternals.  Now she has a direct link to Arishem.  Arishem warns Sersi that the Emergence is coming.  Years ago, Arishem implanted the Celestial Tiamut on Earth. But for Tiamut to be born, the Earth and its people must die.  Sersi loves the people and Earth.  She decides to get all the Eternals together to save the planet and humans.<br/><br/>You can not be late for this film because the opening crawl sets up the history of the Eternals, like Star Wars.  And the story is not linear. This movie breaks a lot of ground by having the first deaf, Korean, and openly gay superheroes. Understand that even with better graphics, Real 3D only enhances a few scenes. Of course, as you watch, you know this film is a setup for something bigger.  And it doesn't disappoint with two end credit scenes.  While the movie entertains and connects itself to the earlier MCU, it ran too long. Also, you will get ten origin stories in one movie. Finally, the last battle feels a bit anti-climatic.  It's a little too early to say if this is your favorite in Phase 4, but it could be a contender based on the costumes, jokes, and internal conflict.  And parents, there is one fifteen-second love-making scene in this film.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ellie Turner dances in her bedroom and listens to 60s music when she sees her mother's reflection in her mirror. Then Ellie's grandmother, Peggy, calls Ellie downstairs.  Ellie got an acceptance letter from the London College of Fashion. Peggy begs Ellie to take care of herself because she has the same 'gift' for seeing ghosts as her mother. Ellie rents a room from Ms. Collins and gets comfortable.  On her first night in the house, Ellie dreams she is in 1960s London.  And when Ellie looks at her reflection, Ellie sees a young blonde girl.  The girl's name is Sandie, and she went to the Cafe de Paris to find the owner.  Sandie wants to become a singer and take over the London night scene.  The bartender tells Sandie the owner isn't there but a manager, Jack, is looking for new talent. Soon they are on the dance floor, kissing and running away after Jack defends Sandie's honor.<br/><br/>Then Ellie wakes up and goes to class.  Jocasta spots a hickey on Ellie's neck, and Ellie remembers it's from Jack kissing Sandie.  Soon, Ellie dyes her hair, dresses, and talks like Sandie.  The next night, Ellie watches as Jack gets Sandie an audition at a club, and Sandie wows the owner. When she is fast asleep, Ellie is in the audience.  She expects to see Sandie front and center, singing for the world to see.  But Sandie is another chorus girl in the burlesque show.  Sandie's dream is a nightmare that will leave her looking at the business end of a knife.  This stab into reality will haunt Ellie until she learns what happened to Sandie and the man responsible.<br/><br/>This film mixes the paranormal with teen drama and mystery. As Ellie looks at Sandie's life through Sandie's eyes, Ellie is envious of Sandie's tenacity.  When she learns the path Sandie's life spiraled into, Ellie stands outside of Sandie's body. Being on the outside allowed Ellie to be more critical of Sandie instead of admiring her. The film transports you when Ellie flashes back to Sandie's life. And the edits between Sandie and Ellie are flawless.  When Sandie's end comes across the scene, it will be a poetic justice you were not expecting.  While the film does feel long and has an unnecessary romance, it is highly entertaining and will make you want to do a double-take.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

While it entertains, the plot covers complex issues like social anxiety, viral celebrity, online bullying, and friendship. Now, don't be surprised if your child wants a B-Bot in the beginning.  However, by the end, it will change.  Also, the story gives insight into the inner workings of tech companies.  Often privacy and safety come second to profits, no matter how good the intentions. So get the family together and enjoy this film.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Paul Atreides wakes up from another dream about a young Freman woman.  While he lies to his mother, Lady Jessica, about the visions, he practices his voice with her.  Paul, like Jessica, has telepathic abilities, but they have to find the right tone to command people to do what they say.  After the lesson, Paul meets with his mentor Duncan.  Paul requests to go on Duncan's next mission, but Duncan says no. Later, Paul tells his father, Leto, the ruler of Caladan, that he is not ready to lead. Paul attends Leto's takeover of the Arrakis from the House of Harkonnen, ruled by Baron Vladimir.  Leto's faction will have control of the 'spice' produced by Arrakis.  'Spice' extends the human lifespan and is a critical element for interstellar space travel. While Vladimir hands over Arrakis freely, he does it with a trick up his sleeve.  Vladimir weakened the spice harvesters, created a plan to kill Paul, and added a mole in the House of Atreides. Paul will have to step into Leto's shoes and use all of his training to save Atreides, his family, 'spice,' and the Fremen.<br/><br/>Based on Dune by Frank Herbert, this remake is one of the finest visual movies of all time.  Viewers become engrossed in Frank's world with the costumes, scenes, creatures, and machinery. Seeing a film of this scale on a large screen is a must.  You can not be late for this movie.  The first 10 minutes cover the entire backstory for each house and the importance of spice.  Now what they gave the audience in visual effects, they lost in some of the audio.  The internal voices in Paul's mind become hard to understand when several voices overlap. Understandably, producers wanted the fighting scenes and sound effects to be grand, but it shouldn't come at the cost of dialog.  While you won't pay to see it again, you will be glad you saw it in theaters. But don't wait too long, because part 2 is in the works.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Last Duel",
    "review":"Marguerite de Carrouges sits stone-faced at the dinner table with her husband, Sir Jean de Carrouges, and mother-in-law. Once in the bedroom, he tries to have sex, but Marguerite refuses. Before he left, Jean told Marguerite not to leave the house nor be alone because it wasn't safe.  However, Marguerite's mother-in-law departed and took all the servants.  A man Marguerite knew came to the door, and she let him in.  But she didn't see Jacques Le Gris standing by the door.  When Marguerite opened it, both men came in.  Jacques declared his love for her, but she refused him.  Then, Jacques raped her. Jacques used his power to gain the land promised in Marguerite's dowry and took Jean's captain position under Count Pierre d'Alençon. Jean thinks Jacques raping his wife is another slight against him.<br/><br/>Jean knows that Pierre will reject any charges because Jacques is his friend.  So, Jean uses gossip to have the charges tried in a church trial.  During the proceedings, Jean lays down his glove to declare a duel to the death to prove Marguerite is telling the truth, and Jacques accepts. The judge tells Marguerite that she will be chained with an iron collar, tied to a post, whipped, and burned alive. With her life in the hands of Jean, Marguerite declares that she told the truth and she will suffer any fate of the duel.<br/><br/>Based on The Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal, and Trial by Combat by Eric Jager and inspired by actual events, the writer tells this plot in three chapters.  The first chapter is Jean's truth. The second chapter is Jacques's truth. The final chapter is Marguerite's truth. Watching the same events from different perspectives allows you to see the events through someone else's eyes. So pay attention.  With that said, this movie should come with a trigger warning for sexual assault survivors.  It depicts Marguerite's rape twice. While the costumes and performances were accurate, you won't leave the movie feeling like you want to see it twice.  But the gruesome battles and duels make the film worth seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
