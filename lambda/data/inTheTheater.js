    "mtitle": "Greenland 2: Migration",
    "review": "It's been five years since the interstellar comet Clarke hit the Earth, wiping out 75% of the population. The survivors inside the Thule Airbase bunker in Greenland tried to venture out 9 months after the blast. However, the radiation and sporadic debris showers made inhabiting the area impossible. John puts on protective gear and explores the land for supplies while his wife, Allison, works on the board. Their son, Nathan, now 15, attends school with the other kids in the bunker.<br/><br/>John retrieves items from a shipwreck, fixes issues around the bunker, and meets with his therapist. His prolonged exposure to the surface has left him with a cough. Allison has noticed, but John assures her that he's fine. Allison sits with the board and discusses whether they should abandon the bunker and look for greener pastures. Doctor Amina and other scientists determined that Clarke's initial impact point has become an oasis. Then, a debris field hits and crushes the bunker. John, Allison, and Nathan barely escape with their lives. They decide to travel to England, the location of Clark's initial impact. They hope to find the rumored oasis. Will they survive with their family intact?<br/><br/>This sequel follows the same formula as its predecessor. The script shows you how people survive the confines of the shelter. Then, everything collapses. The family escapes one nightmare, but deals with soldiers, looters, insurgents, and terrorists. This pacing keeps the audience entertained and invested. The graphics aren't groundbreaking. However, they blend evenly with the film. The conclusion did try to invoke tears, but that won't happen. This picture lives up to the hype, but it doesn't leave you with an urge to buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Song Sung Blue",
    "review": "Mike stands in front of his Alcoholics Anonymous group with his guitar. He celebrates his 20th sober birthday just like his other birthdays, singing 'Song Sung Blue.' After the meeting, Mike arrives at the Wisconsin State Fair with a Hawaiian shirt. He tells his friend, Buddy Holly impersonator Mark, that he can't do Don Ho. Mike wants to go on as himself, Lightning. Mark refuses and reworks the show. Claire, a Patsy Cline impersonator, says Mike would be better at playing Neil Diamond. Claire walks on stage and sings while Mike watches from the crowd.<br/><br/>Mike plays guitar for The Esquires the following day, and Claire dances to the music. They meet afterward for food and talk. They sing together, making beautiful music. Mike admits that impersonating Neil isn't enough. Claire understands that he wants to interpret Neil. They kiss, giving Mike an idea. He is lightning, and she is thunder. They can become Lightning and Thunder: The Neil Diamond Experience. Can this duo rise to fame in Wisconsin?<br/><br/>This script has everything for everyone, including Sweet Caroline. And you don't have to be a Neil Diamond fan to enjoy the movie. In fact, you may discover a new favorite Neil Diamond song. Neil isn't the focal point, just the catalyst that brought these two people together. These actors pull off once-in-a-lifetime performances with an honest portrayal of two people finding strength in each other. This film is a testament to their resilience, families, and pure love of music. It will resonate with the audience and make you believe that love can conquer all. This picture is for movie and music fans alike. While it's not perfect, it's close to it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Marty Supreme",
    "review": "Marty Mauser works at his uncle Maury's shoe store. As Marty sneaks in his girlfriend, Rachel, Maury asks to meet with Marty. He hands Marty a business card with Marty's name and the title 'Manager' on it. Marty reminds Maury that he doesn't want to sell shoes. Also, Maury's son, Lloyd, will dislike being passed over. Marty dreams of going to the British Open for Table Tennis.<br/><br/>Later, Marty practices with his friend, Wally, and returns to the store for his check. Lloyd locks the safe, and Marty grabs a gun from Maury's desk. Marty threatens to shoot Lloyd over the money. Then, Marty shows Lloyd the business card. Lloyd opens the safe and gives Marty $700.<br/><br/>Marty arrives in London and hates his accommodations. After making it to the finals, Marty sits down with reporters. They stop talking when actress Kay Stone enters. Marty sets his sights on her and invites her to his room. Before the finals, Marty takes a moment to cozy up to Kay's husband, Milton. However, Marty's plans shatter when he loses to Japanese hopeful Koto Endo. Marty will do anything to prove his purpose: to dominate table tennis. Will he prove the world wrong and become the face of the sport?<br/><br/>It's not easy, but the writers make every character in this film unlikable. It should be about one man's triumph over his doubters. However, Marty is condescending, arrogant, rude, and manipulative. The audience prays for his downfall to humble him. Inspired by Marty Reisman, the technology and style follow the 1950s, but the slang falls short. This picture is Oscar-worthy because the acting is phenomenal. However, the audience won't cheer for anyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Anaconda",
    "review": "Actor Griff mopes around a studio after a director fires him. He sees an Anaconda movie poster and gets an idea. He calls his old friend, Doug, and leaves a message. In high school, Doug would direct and write films, and Griff would act in them. They were supposed to move to LA together, but Doug got cold feet.<br/><br/>Doug is a wedding videographer. He hates the cheesy productions, but they pay the bills. He enters his house and finds a surprise party awaiting him. He greets his friend, Claire. She is a divorced attorney. Doug smiles when he sees Griff. He has the ultimate present. He found an old copy of Doug's first film, The Quinch, stuck in his mom's VCR. They play the tape, and everyone loves it.<br/><br/>Doug meets Griff, Claire, and their friend, Kenny, for lunch. Griff got the rights to their favorite movie, Anaconda. He wants to travel to the Amazon for 3 weeks and remake the film. Griff wants Doug to direct and write, Kenny to shoot it, and Claire to be his co-star. After a few days, Doug caves and chooses to do the project.<br/><br/>They travel to the Amazon and meet with their snake wrangler, Santiago. They find their vessel at the dock, but the captain isn't there. Ana says her father couldn't make it, but the boat needs repairs. They beg her to take them instead. Ana sees the men chasing her approaching, and she relents to the film crew's demands to save herself. Griff and Doug think they are going to make Anaconda. However, they are about to live it. Who will survive?<br/><br/>Whether you call this a remake, a re-imaging, or a reboot, it's a funny and scary good time. The film has some parallels with the source material. However, it's special and a future cult classic. The script takes jabs at itself and Hollywood without being mean. And fans of the original get surprise cameos. The jump scares are properly timed and don't take away from the humor and friendship. Eagle-eyed viewers should watch for the Jurassic Park moment. The audience should stay for the mid-credit scenes to get another laugh. While you may not buy this film, you will watch it again on streaming for the jokes you missed. This picture isn't perfect, but it's a mindless, good time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Housemaid",
    "review": "Millie arrives at the Winchester Estate, and Nina Winchester greets Millie with a smile and hor d'oeuvres. Nina examines Millie's résumé and qualifications. She reiterates that the position is a live-in maid. Nina confesses that she's expecting but hasn't told her husband, Andrew, or daughter, CeCe. Millie thinks everything is wonderful. Nina expresses that she has more applicants to interview before choosing a housemaid. But she will call Millie back soon.<br/><br/>Millie drives away, removes her glasses, and rolls her eyes. She never expects to hear from Nina again. Millie is on probation for 5 years after serving 10 years in prison. She knows one background check will rule her out. Millie takes showers in gas station bathrooms, applies for any job, and sleeps in her car. When her phone rings, it's Nina offering Millie the job. She wants Millie to start as soon as possible, and Millie is willing to do so this afternoon. Millie thinks her prayer has been answered. She has a steady job, a paycheck, and a place to live. Her probation officer will be pleased. However, Millie has no idea the danger lurking behind the iron gate.<br/><br/>Based on The Housemaid by Freida McFadden, this film is a wild ride that plays with motifs, surroundings, and wardrobe to convey deeper meanings. The house is void of color except for one bathroom with snake wallpaper. Nina always wears a hue of white until the telling ending. She's seen as clean, perfect, and pure. Millie and Andrew stain on the screen as they wear darker wardrobes. The different angles show the power dynamic shift throughout the film. It will leave you dizzy. Also, the split screens and overlays of different people experiencing the same turmoil are jaw-dropping. This film will make you want to read the book and compare it. It's pragmatic, cultural, and surprising.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
