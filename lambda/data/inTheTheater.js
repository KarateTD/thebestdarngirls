    "mtitle":"Bombshell",
    "review":"In 2018, the world at Fox News was not ready for the storm looming behind the hills. On-air talent Gretchen Carlson was meeting with her lawyers to create an argument for her harassment claim. She has found a way to sue Roger Ailes and not Fox News. When Gretchen comes forward, dozens will follow. Including Megyn Kelly. When everyone has to take sides, who can be trusted and who will be left standing?<br/><br/>Based on a true scandal, this movie should be seen as an outline of the events, not gospel. Their views on what happened and why can be derived from their real-life interviews. These women went from reporting the news to being a part of the story. The Fox News scandal will be a case study for years to come.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Victoria is a young kitten abandoned by her owners and left in an alley. The Jellicle tribe takes interest in Victoria and they tell her about the Jellicle Ball. Each cat performs for Old Deuteronomy and she picks someone to go to the Heaviside Layer for a new life. As talented cats start to disappear, who will win the Jellicle Ball?<br/><br/>Based on the stage musical Cats which derived from Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the graphic and motion capture teams have done A+ work creating this film. Each cats’ essences, even down to the movement of their tails and their ears was perfectly in sync. The plot starts to slow down and the songs were not distinctive enough. The movie is fun for the whole family but only if you know the original play. Others will be lost in the plot.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker",
    "review":"Kylo Ren has been promised the throne to the Final Order, he only has to kill Rey. But he is warned, she is not who she appears to be. Fin, Po, and Chewbacca got a message from a First Order mole that Kylo Ren is coming for Rey and the Sith are on the rise again. They fly to General Leia and Rey to update them with the intel. Rey is still completing her Jedi training. When she gets the intel from Po and Fin, she wants to face Kylo Ren alone. Recently, Rey has been having visions of her sitting on the Sith Throne next to Kylo Ren. She fears what she may become. But her friends refuse to let her do this on her own. They have to get a Wayfinder, discover the Sith planet, and put an end to the First and Final Order.<br/><br/>Extreme Star Wars fans will not like this movie. Strong Star Wars fans will pick apart its inconsistencies but applaud the effort. Casual fans will love the cinematography and plot connections with the 4th, 5th, and 6th Episodes. Action fans will appreciate the choreographed fight scenes but want more blood. Overall, this story provided a final send off for the franchise. Each character was given a solid ending to their story and you got lost in the world of Star Wars. This movie is in 3D but it's not necessary. But, you should see it in IMAX. And don't forget to bring your droid hacker.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Richard Jewell",
    "review":"In 1986, Watson noticed Richard Jewell's attention to detail and nicknamed him Radar. When Richard gets a job in law enforcement, Watson gives him $100 to not become a jerk. Ten years later, Watson hears Richard is being interviewed for finding a bomb in Centennial Park. Watson is proud because Richard, labeled a hero, gives praise to everyone involved in the rescue efforts. When Richard is given book offers, he calls the only lawyer he knows, Watson. But when the FBI focuses their investigation on Richard, he will need Watson for a lot more.<br/><br/>It’s so hard to see a system Richard loves and respects so much turn on him. Richard tries to explain the FBI's actions to his family and friends. He believes they are the good guys like him. The FBI’s mistakes are sadly laughable as it is disgusting. In a day when sensationalism and clicks determine innocence and guilt, how long until another Richard Jewell is tried by the media?<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Jumanji: The Next Level",
    "review":"Spencer feels like his life is in a rut so he goes back into Jumanji to feel brave.  Realizing what he has done, Beth, Anthony, and Marsha go back in to save him.  However, Bethany is left behind and Spencer's grandfather, Eddie, and Eddie's former friend, Milo are pulled into Jumanji.  With new avatars, missions, and goals, this is the next level of Jumanji.<br/><br/>Jumanji does just what the title says it will do, it goes to the next level.  Every character you know is back and more were added for fun.  It has all of the laughs and craziness you want from this franchise.  As the trailers say, not everyone will leave the game.  Jack Black is the breakout again playing 3 different characters.  Kevin Hart shows his acting chops as he plays Milo Walker.  See this movie as soon as you can.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
