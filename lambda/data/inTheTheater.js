    "review":"Hattie injects herself with a deadly virus to prevent Brixton and Eteon from obtaining it.  After Brixton makes Hattie look like an M.I. 6 traitor, Hattie is enemy number one.  In L.A., Hobbs gets a call to find Hattie and bring her and the virus back to the CIA.  In London, Shaw is called to find Hattie and the virus.  The two men answer the call but refuse to work together.  Hobbs finds Hattie with logistics, but Shaw uses his heart.  Hattie is his sister.  When Hobbs catches Hattie and brings her back to the CIA, both men believe they have a handle on the situation, but Hattie reveals the truth.  The virus is inside of her in plastic capsules.  If they don't find a way to remove it, the virus will melt her from the inside out and spread in epidemic proportions.  Also, Shaw reveals Hattie is his sister.  The two must work together to save the world and find Brixton before the virus kills Hattie.<br/><br/>This spin-off to the Fast and Furious franchise provides a more in-depth view of Hobbs and Shaw's histories but is not necessary to the overall franchise storyline.  While it helps to see the last 4 movies, you don't need to see this spin-off one to enjoy the franchise.  The action sequences are nothing new.  Also, the final battle has new school hacking mixed with old school Samoan fighting style.  See it in IMAX with the matinee price and stay past the end credits.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Rick Dalton lives next door to Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski.  As Sharon's star rises in Hollywood, Rick's star is falling.  He played in a popular western years ago but he has been reduced to guest starring as the 'heavy' on newer, more popular shows.  Producer Marvin Schwarzs warns Rick this will be the end of his career.  Rick isn't the only one effected by his failing career.  His stunt double, Cliff, is feeling the effects too.  Now, Cliff works as Rick's driver and gofer to make ends meet.  With 2 nerve-racking encounters with the Manson Family, one August night will end in bloodshed.<br/><br/>This period piece paid close attention to the details of the time.  The clothes, slang, tech, and commercials were all done perfectly.  It's hard to establish what's true or false when watching this movie.  You will feel the urge to do research the moment you get home.  However, you won't feel the urge to buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Simba is next in line for the throne.  But his Uncle Scar believes it's his rightful place.  Scar convinces Simba to go to the gorge to practice his roar.  Soon, Simba is in the middle of a stampede.  Scar runs to his brother, King Mufasa to help Simba but its a trap.  When Simba isn't looking, Scar kills Mufasa and blames the death on Simba.  Scar tells Simba to run away and never come back.  Scar promotes the lawless hyenas as his army while they lay waste to the pride.  It will take one old friend, 2 new friends, and fur to bring Simba back to the pride.<br/><br/>The live-adaption of this Disney classic stays true to the original with astounding attention to detail within mind-blowing graphics.  However, making these animals look like animals, takes away the emotions the animated characters possessed.  This forced the movie to rely on the voice actors to convey every pure emotion.  Some succeeded while other's fell flat.  Also, the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is performed midday.  It feels out of place.  Overall, the movie may not be better than the first but it is still a strong movie worth seeing.  It's better in IMAX and/or 3D.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Javed is harassed on the street and controlled at home.  While his factory-working father, Malik, wants Javed to be an accountant or lawyer, Javed dreams of being a writer.  After bumping Foop's cassettes on the ground, Foops lets Javed borrow them.  Javed can't believe a white American will have any idea what he goes through.  At the lowest point in his life, Javed turns on the cassette and presses play.  That pivotal decision will alter the course of his life forever.<br/><br/>Based on a memoir, this movie chooses the best Bruce Springsteen lyrics for critical moments in Javed's life.  He finds the courage to write, talk to a girl, and stand up to the haters.  Springsteen fans will fall in love while Javed goes through self-discovery with Bruce leading the way.  Like 'Yesterday', the music is more memorable than the movie.  Also, don't give up on Malik.  He is a strong man with a lot of pain inside.  You will like this movie but not enough to buy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Stu drives an Uber to help invest in his friends spin cycle business.  Hopelessly stuck in the friend zone, Stu wishes for more.  Vic is on a path to revenge after Tedjo murders his partner.  After having the case for 6 months, Captain McHenry tells Vic the Feds are ready to take over.  Angry, Vic gets Lasik and has lunch with his daughter.  Since he can't see and she is busy with her gallery opening, she downloads Uber on his phone so he can attend.  While Vic's eyes heal, Vic gets a call from his C.I. Leon.  Leon tells Vic Tedjo has a huge shipment coming today and the call drops.  Vic tries to drive to Leon but crashes his car.  He orders an Uber to take him to Leon's shop and gets Stu.  This ride will change these men's lives forever.  But whether or not it's for the better, is up to you.<br/><br/>Be ready to laugh until it hurts.  Don't make the mistake of calling this a buddy-cop movie.  Stu is not a cop and the two men are not friends.  This is a comedy with stunning action sequences and personal character growth.  This movie may not be appropriate for kids under 14.  In addition, there are no post-credit scenes.  If you are looking for the best laugh you will get in the theater, Stuber is for you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
