But when Ant-Man comes back from the quantum realm, he develops an idea to get the stones back, recreate the gauntlet and bring everyone back.<br/><br/>This movie is more than you could have imagined.  The 3 hours do not feel long enough.  Stunning sendoffs are given to each original Avenger and Stan Lee.  You will need to see this movie multiple times because it will continue to blow your mind and bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

They just need one thing: the address.<br/><br/>This is not a \"coming-of-age\" movie.  These women are strong, smart, and liked.  They just forgot to have fun.  Their friendship and world views will be tested.  And you will laugh at every milestone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

After 20 minutes under water and 25 minutes of rescue efforts, the nurses stop working to allow John's mother to say her goodbyes.  As she prays for God to save her son, his heart starts beating again.  She will need her faith, her family, and her pastor to get her through as she prays for her son.<br/><br/>This movie will have you in tears.  While it shows John's journey, it doesn't sugar coat his mom's struggles.  She appeared to be a rock but she was pushing others away.  Also, this movie gives insight to John's experience after his survival.  See it with the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

But when she looks past his facade, can she resist his charms?  What will it costs Tessa to have Hardin in her life?<br/><br/>This movie is twilight without vampires.  Nothing really sets it apart from other teen angst movies.  Since it is the first book in a 4 book series, the movie ends on a cliff hanger.  If you are a fan of the genre, see it matinee.  Otherwise, wait for Redbox..<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

He offers to give Lionel proof of his existence, if Lionel takes him to meet is cousins:  The Yeti of the Himalayas.<br/><br/>This movie is only fun for the first and last 10 minutes.  The rest of the movie is boring.  Even the amazing graphics can't save this film.  Wait for cable.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars.",
