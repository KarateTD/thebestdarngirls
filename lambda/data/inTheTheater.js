    "review":"Captain Davis calls Sheriff Joe Deacon into his office.  A witness to a crime can't remember the attacker's face but remembers their boots.  A crime lab in L.A., Deacon's old stomping grounds, has them in their custody. When Deacon gets authorization from L.A. homicide, they will give the evidence to him.  Captain Farris welcomes Deacon back, but the current case is the focus of Deacon's attention.  Over two months, someone killed four people.  The details of the murders remind Deacon of a murder case that he had in L.A. several years ago.  Detective Jimmy Baxter briefs the press while noticing Deacon in the background. Jimmy invites Deacon along to investigate the latest murder. While Jimmy collects information on the victim, Farris calls Jimmy into his office.  Farris informs Jimmy that Deacon's captain cleared Deacon to leave, but he stayed in town and put in vacation time.  Farris believes Deacon stayed in town to work on the case quietly.  Jimmy finds Deacon, and they agree to work together and share information.  Deacon has one name high on his list of suspects: Albert.  Albert works at an appliance repair shop, and the last victim had an order to get her refrigerator repaired. Jimmy and Deacon will work together to get Albert.<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery that never solves itself. The movie starts as a whodunit and ends with one man redeeming another to redeem himself.  You leave the theater, or your couch, completely dissatisfied and confused with the ending.  With three award-winning actors at the helm of this project, you wish the script offered more. Save this movie for cable or background noise.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sam and Tusker travel to Sam's family home in their RV. At a rest stop, Sam gets out to buy snacks.  Then, he notices that Tusker isn't in the RV.  Sam gets in the RV and, in full panic, searches for Tusker.  After hours, he finds Tusker at the end of the road with their dog, dazed and confused.  Tusker admits to Sam that he stopped taking his pills, and Tusker didn't bring any for their trip. Tusker thinks the pills are affecting his ability to write his novel. As Tusker charms Sam's family, Sam sneaks into their RV and finds the lockbox containing Tusker's book.  Sam finds the key and opens the box.  Inside, Sam discovers Tusker's hidden pain and the depth of his illness.<br/><br/>This movie tries too hard to make you care.  It becomes a slow, rambling, less funny version of Me Before You.  For the first 30 minutes, you feel like a child, in the backseat, listening to your parents bicker back and forth.  You want out of the car.  They never say what the disease is, and the plot leaves you wondering if it is dementia, Alzheimer's, or brain cancer. The heartfelt moments come at the end, but you don't care anymore. Skip the theaters, instead wait for it to be available on cable.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jim works on his cattle ranch but fell behind on his mortgage after his wife died of cancer.  The bank will auction it in 90 days if he doesn't come up with the money. At the border fence, Jim almost hits a young boy with his car.  Then Jim sees a woman grab the young boy and limps away.  He yells at the woman to stop and states that she won't make it with her injured leg.  He offers to call border patrol, and they will take her to the hospital.  Rosa begs Jim not to call border patrol and help her and her son, Miguel, get to a safe place.  She offers to pay.  But Jim refuses to take her money and calls border patrol.  Border patrol tells Jim it will take some time to get to them, and Jim notices a black SUV come to the fence.  Maurico gets out of the SUV and tells Jim to hand over Rosa and Miguel. Maurico stops being nice, pulls out a gun, and starts firing.  Jim returns their fire, pulls Rosa and Miguel into his car, and drives off. He fires more shots, but Jim gets away.  Jim notices Rosa has a bullet wound in her abdomen.  Jim pulls over to help her, but he can see she won't make it.  Rosa tells Jim to take all she has and take Miguel to his relatives in Chicago. When border patrol arrives, Jim hands Miguel over to the authorities, and one is his stepdaughter, Sarah. Worried, Jim stays at the headquarters, and he spots Maurico waiting. Jim knows that Maurico will kill Miguel in Mexico, so Jim breaks Miguel out of headquarters and plans to drive him to Chicago.  Maurico and his men are on their tails.  They will bribe, hack, or kill anyone or anything in their way.<br/><br/>This movie is News of the World, Taken, and John Wick rolled into one.  The movie touches on immigration, medical cost, and the treatment of veterans and ranchers. As for the action, there is nothing new nor exciting about it.  It's the connection between Jim and Miguel that pulls you into the story.  Other than that, it's 100% predictable and typical.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Diana works at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as a senior anthropologist. She sees a woman picking up papers scattered all over the floor and bends down to help her.  The woman introduces herself as Barbara Minerva, a geologist and gemologist that likes cryptography.  As Diana walks away, Carol walks in looking for Barbara.  While investigating a jewelry store robbery, police uncovered the store was a front for selling black market antiquities.  The FBI will bring the items to the museum for Barbara to analyze.  As Barbara looks over the items, Diana comes to check things out.  They notice a unique looking stone, but it has a marking Barbara can't understand.  Diana recognizes the language and tells Barbara it says hold it and make a wish.  Diana holds it and makes a wish, and then she invites Barbara to an early dinner.  Later, Diana holds the stone on her desk and wishes to be more like Diana.  The next day, Carol brings their latest platinum donor, Max Lord, on a private tour.  He notices the stone in Barbara's office and wants to know more about it, but Barbara stops him.  He invites Barbara and Diana to a party in his honor for his donation. Diana goes to the party looking for Max.  Max finds Barbara and goes to her office to make out.  In the middle of the session, he asks to borrow the stone for a few days, and she says yes.  As Diane searches for Max, a man calls out to her and says, 'I wish we had more time.'  She turns in blistering anger and tells him not to say that.  It slowly sinks in that her wish came true, and Steve's ghost is in another man's body.  She forgets about Max and focuses on Steve.  This focus is a mistake.  Max runs Black Gold Corporation and advertises it on TV, and while it may look successful, it's a ponzi scheme. But he doesn't wish for his company to succeed, but he makes a wish to become the stone. Diana goes to Max's office and finds dust.  She sees a metal ring that once held the stone and sees an engraving on the inside.  The stone came from the God of Lies. He is granting wishes for his gain.  Diana must find and destroy him before Max destroys the world.<br/><br/>Sequel to Wonder Woman, this movie has all the hair, shoulder pads, and greed of the 1980s.  Many who have seen this movie complain it doesn't have a villain.  But they fail to realize, in the 1980s, greed was at an all-time high. So, greed is the ultimate villain.  The fight scenes are well choreographed and framed perfectly for each shot.  And let's mentions Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  The look on his face is priceless. It does help to see the first movie to catch the little tidbits from the first.  With all the strong points, the film runs too long.  The romance between Steve and Diana takes up too much time. Some of the CGI turns the movie into a cartoon and takes away from the viewing experience.  This movie is watchable for those willing to enjoy a DC movie, not a DC movie compared to Marvel.  And stay after the first end-credits for a blast-from-the-past cameo.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"One night a week, Cassie goes to a club and pretends to be falling-down drunk.  She waits for a guy to pick her up, take her home, and try to rape her.  Before the assault, Cassie tells the guys, 'I'm sober, and I could hurt you.'  At work, a man recognizes her from college.  His name is Ryan, and he's a pediatric surgeon.  They were both pre-med at Forrester University until Cassie dropped out.  Ryan wants to know why, but Cassie won't divulge.  As they talk, he mentions he still talks to their old classmates, including Al Monroe.  That name makes Cassie extremely curious and angry because she thought Al was in London.  Ryan explains Al is back in town to get married, and he became an anesthesiologist after college.  She goes home and looks up Al and several other people, and then creates a Kill Bill worthy revenge list.  And she does it all for Nina.<br/><br/>It doesn't take much to figure out who Nina is and what happened to her.  So, the plot doesn't take the time to explain that.  It follows Cassie's path of rage as she plays pied piper to so-called nice guys.  But her point isn't to murder, but to teach and warn them. But she never has a real plan until she hears Al's name.  She goes from devious to cunning.  She doesn't only go after the man who attacked Nina, but Cassie goes after the ones who let him get away with it.  And once she gets to Al, she has so much more planned for him, and you will love it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
