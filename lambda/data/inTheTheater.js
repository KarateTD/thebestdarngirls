    "review":"Before this review begins, there will be 0 spoilers.  It won't go beyond what you have seen in the trailers, promise.  Now, with that said, on to the review.<br/><br/>Before Mysterio died, he released a propaganda video revealing the identity of Spider-Man.  Peter looks down and sees people hounding MJ. He grabs her and takes her back to his apartment.  Before nightfall, the police bring them to the station for questioning.  While they don't have enough to hold them, Peter Parker's lawyer warns him, Aunt May, and Happy that the court of public opinion will try them.  But Peter puts that behind him because he has something more pressing: college admissions.  He, Ned, and MJ all applied to the same schools, with MIT being their dream school.  Zero schools accept them because of their association with Spider-Man.  Peter walks to Dr. Strange's brownstone to find a tundra.  Peter wants to reverse time so people wouldn't know he was Spider-Man.  Dr. Strange reminds Peter that he doesn't have the Time stone, but Dr. Strange gets another idea.  The world could forget Peter is Spider-Man.  As he is casting it, Peter begins to make changes.  Dr. Strange can see the spell becoming unmanageable, so he contains it in a box.  He tells Peter that he can't believe Peter would risk the universe because MIT wouldn't reconsider accepting him and his friends.  He didn't know he could talk to MIT about rethinking their admission.<br/><br/>Peter tracks down the MIT admissions officer stuck in traffic on a bridge.  As he pleads his case, he gets a Peter Tingle.  Then, Dr. Otto Octavius attacks him.  After a wild, car-dangling battle, Spider-Man overcomes Dr. Octavius.  Dr. Strange changes the boxed spell to send Dr. Octavius back to his universe to meet his fate.  But when Peter learns that fate is death, Peter takes the box.  Taking a page from Aunt May's book, Spider-Man will heal before he hurts.  It was too late then; is it too late to help now?<br/><br/>Wow! This movie will make you jump out of your seat, cry, cheer, and knock your socks off with established and new characters.  While all the graphics aren't great, the storytelling is superb.  Fans will get the Marvel movie they've wanted since Far From Home.  This character is the most complex and introspective Spider-Man we have seen.  And there are two post-credits scenes.  While the first is funny, the second will reveal a glimpse into the new, beautiful, and awe-inspiring future of the MCU.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"While running from war with triplets, Pedro stopped, kissed his wife, Alma, and headed towards the soldiers.  He sacrificed himself for his family.  Alma fell to the ground in tears.  Then her candle started to glow, and mountains grew around her.  And from nowhere, a house, Casita, formed out of thin air with magic.  However, it wasn't the only magical entity.  When each family member came of age, they would touch the candle, and their door would reveal their gift.  Mirabel is a decedant of one of the triplets.  Unlike her family, she did not get a gift.  Now, the townspeople and the family worry that the same thing will happen to Mirabel's cousin, Antonio.  The entire community watches the ceremony, but Antonio wants Mirabel by his side.  Antonio touches the door and gets the ability to talk to animals.  The town celebrates, and Mirabel walks around thinking about her purpose.  Then she sees the house starting to crack, and the candle's flame almost extinguished.  Mirabel runs to tell the family, but they see nothing and blame it on jealousy.  After talking to several family members, she learns that her estranged uncle Bruno, gifted with premonitions, had a vision of the family losing the magic but never finished his vision.  Mirabel decides to go through Bruno's door and complete his premonition to save her Casita, her family, and the entire town.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't just point out Mirabel's struggles; it allows her and the audience to see that each of her family members has their struggles too. If you ever feel unimportant or under immense pressure, this movie will speak to you and bring a tear to your eye.  With stunning visual effects, this film will engross your whole family.  And be prepared to dance in your seat.  Be aware this movie isn't about good guys versus bad guys.  It's about the struggle we all face within.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"House of Gucci",
    "review":"Patrizia Reggiani sits on a stool and asks the man behind the bar for a drink.  He tells her he isn't the bartender but makes her drink anyway.  When she asks his name, he tells Patrizia he is Maurizio Gucci. Maurizio is the heir to half of the Gucci fashion empire. The next day, Patrizia pretends to bump into him at the library.  Maurizio studies law at the local college and has no plans on joining the family business. A few days later, Maurizio calls the feisty brunette to make a date.<br/><br/>After a brief courtship, Maurizio introduces Patrizia to his father, Rodolfo.  Patrizia tries to impress Rodolfo, but he sees her as a simple golddigger. If he marries her, Rodolfo will cut him off.  For the first time, Maurizio stands up to Rodolfo and marries Patrizia.  Maurizio works at Patrizia's father's trucking company cleaning cars until Maurizio gets a call from his uncle, Aldo. He wants to groom Maurizio without Paolo or Rodolfo's knowledge.  Patrizia tells Maurizio to take the deal and claim his birthright. Notwithstanding, Rodolfo doesn't welcome Maurizio or Patrizia back into his life until they have their first child.  With Rodolfo's illness, he wants his son by his side.  This decision is the next step to the top.  Not for Maurizio, but for Patrizia.  She will do anything to help Maurizio succeed, secure the empire, and remain a Gucci.<br/><br/>Based on The House of Gucci: a True Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed by Sara Gay Forden, this movie feels like a high-end Deadly Women episode.  Accents aside, the viewer has to determine if Patrizia was a golddigger, extremely ambitious, or both. Don't forget, Patrizia says she isn't ethical.  Patrizia does what it takes to get ahead and plows over anyone who stands in her way. Sadly, Maurizio learns the brilliance and deadly nature of Patrizia at the end.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"While Venus and Serena Williams study and practice, their father, Richard, passes out brochures to everyone at the local country club. Before Venus and Serena's birth, Richard wrote a detailed plan for their tennis career.  While he believes in his daughters, Richard can't get someone to coach the girls for free. With his brochure getting little traction, Richard packs up Venus and Serena and drives them to see Paul Cohen.  Richard talks Paul into watching the girls hit a few balls, and Paul is impressed.  But he tells Richard that he can only coach Venus for the junior tournaments.  This moment is the first time something hasn't gone according to the plan. Now, Richard has to make a lasting decision that will affect Venus and Serena's lives forever.  Heavy is the head that wears the crown.<br/><br/>King Richard tells the story of a complicated man in a battle with himself and the world for what he pre-ordained. At the moment, it's hard to understand if Richard is doing this for pride or love.  Often, Brandy calls him out on his pride privately. Although he is instrumental in the girls' success, as Richard steps back, the girls fly. Sit back and watch history in the making.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Callie gets her kids, Trevor and Phoebe, ready to meet with an estate lawyer.  Her father died and left Callie a farmhouse in his will. Inside the home, they find books to the ceiling, numbers on the crown molding, and a future riddled with repairs.  Then Janine walks into the home and tells Callie that her father only had the decrepit house, worthless land, and debt. The next day, Callie drops Phoebe off at summer science camp, meets Phoebe's teacher, Gary Grooberson.  Then, Callie drops Trevor off at work.  At work, Trevor meets his crush, Lucky.  She invites Trevor to go to the old mine with other co-workers to have fun.  At the mine shaft, they see a glowing figure and hear noises.<br/><br/>At school, Gary puts on Kujo for his students.  Then, he steps back into his office.  Phoebe walks in, sees his seismic activity map, and asks Gary about it.  Gary explains that Summerville isn't on a fault line, but it shakes every day. When Phoebe gets home, she notices a chess piece moved. She grabs the PKE meter she found earlier and goes through the house.  Under the floor, Phoebe discovers a ghost trap.  She takes it to Gary, and he assumes it's a replica.  But when he touches it, the ghost trap starts to spark. When the trap doesn't open, Gary taps it and releases a hell on earth not seen since 1984.<br/><br/>With a Revelations 6:12 warning, this movie builds up new characters while bridging the gap to the previous ones. With so many technological advancements, the director made a smart move by not changing the look or sound of the proton fire or the slime ghost's look.  However, newer graphics are clean and not distracting from the storyline.  With this careful distinction, the director invited new fans to the franchise without alienating the cult-like following of the 1984 classic.  And stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes.  They have fun with the past and build towards the future.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
