    "review":"After a wild bachelorette party, Ali can hear men's thoughts.  At first, she considers getting rid of this ability.  Then, she decides to use it to enter the boys club at her sports management company.  What could go wrong?  While this movie does make fun of men, it doesn't demonize them.  It allows the viewer to see that Ali's biggest obstacle is herself.  This is a great date movie but not a family movie.  Also, you will leave wanting to know: Who voted against Ali?<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In order to save her friend, Suzu, Gloria is put in between a rock and a hard place.  Gloria is threaten to work with drug lord Lino to get information about Suzu.  She unintentionally blows up a DEA safe house.  In an attempt to get help, she gets threaten by the DEA.  So, she is risking life or jail to find her friend.  This movie is 15 minutes of set up and the rest all action.  Once it gets going, it never stops.  And it has more twist and turns than a soap opera.  See it today and hope for a part 2.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 5 years, the Systar aliens have changed Bricksburg to Apocalypseburg.  Now General Sweet Mayhem has kidnapped Emmet's friends to convince Batman to marry Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi.  Emmet must save his friends before his dark premonition comes true.  This is how sequels should be done.  It is funnier, more sincere, and better built than the first.  While there is no need to stay after the end credits, you should stay for the credit song.  And no matter how hard you try, the Catchy Song will stay with you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

She doesn't want Baker to kill him for the abuse, she wants Baker to do it for their son Patrick.  Patrick and Baker share a unique connection.  When Baker gets a visit from Reid, Baker's world is turned upside down.  This is the most confusing movie since Inception.
