    "review":"Michael travels to New Orleans to talk to people still affected by the hurricane.  During this interview with Isaac, he comes across several photos.  One photo is Christine, his former flame.  At some point, Isaac and Christine had a hot and heavy romance.  But Christine left for New York to pursue her dream of photography, leaving Isaac behind.  Isaac’s only regret is not going after her.  Michael can feel a story brewing in this tale of lost love and goes home to New York.  He finds Christine’s daughter Mae.  Mae tells Michael her mother died of cancer a few months ago.  But there is more to the story.  Christine left Mae a safe deposit box with 2 letters and photographs.  One envelope has Mae’s name, the other is blank.  Michael can’t get Mae off his mind and attends a museum event he knows she will be attending.  He tries to be smooth and ask her out.  They go out for dinner; then, talk about music and romance.  After the date, they see each other regularly.  While Mae feels she is doomed to repeat her mother’s mistakes, Michael believes their love can make it.<br/><br/>With nods to Kanye, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar, this movie tells the tale of two love stories.  One between Isaac and Christine and the other between Mae and Michael.  Changes in music, technology, and clothes help you bounce from one time period to another.  With each love story, you get the same message.  Mae and Christine aren’t bad at love; they are bad at communication.  This is a good date matinee movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Longclaw watched over young Sonic and told him to keep his powers a secret.  Then, he is spotted and the tribe of echidnas comes after him.  Longclaw throws a ring and it opens a portal to Earth.  She tells Sonic to stay hidden and never stop running.  She gives him a bag of rings and pushes him through the portal.  Ten years later, Sonic loves the town of Green Hills Montana and its people.  Especially, the Donut Lord, Pretzel Lady, and Crazy Carl.  Donut Lord is Tom Wachowski, the sheriff of Green Hills with aspirations of working for San Francisco PD.  The Pretzel Lady is Tom’s wife Maddie.  She is the local veterinarian.  Crazy Carl has reported a blue hair devil running in the forest at lightning speed.  No one believes him.  Sonic runs around town and quickly adds himself inside people’s everyday lives but he is lonely.  Playing baseball alone, he makes the home run and no one is there to cheer for him.  Upset, he runs around the bases as fast as he can and causes an electronic surge that blacks out the Pacific Northwest.  Fearing an alien invasion, the government hires Dr. Robotnik.  They know he is unhinged but he is the best at what he does.  Sonic sees he is about to be discovered and runs to Tom’s house to open a portal.  Tom hears the commotion in his shed and grabs Maddie’s tranquilizer gun.  Before Sonic throws the ring, Tom shoots Sonic in the leg.  Sonic becomes woozy and looks at Tom’s San Francisco T-shirt.  Sonic throws the ring and a portal to San Francisco’s Transamerica Pyramid opens up.  Sonic faints and his bag of rings falls through.  Sonic wakes up in an unlocked cage hearing Tom talk to Dr. Robotnik.  The pair manage to escape Dr. Robotnik.  However, for Sonic to be safe, he has to find his rings and create a portal to a new planet.  And he will need Tom’s help to get there.<br/><br/>Based on Sonic The Hedgehog video game, this movie shouldn’t be mistaken for just a kids' movie.  The writers understood that classic-gamer of the 1991 Sega Genesis console would be in their 30s and 40s now and watching this movie.  So they added a lot of humor for adults and classic game sound effects for the mature viewer.  Don’t worry parents, the jokes aren’t raunchy, just nostalgic. Also, the movie has Quicksilver moments from the blue-haired speed demon and a sneak peek for part 2.  This is a great matinee movie for the entire family.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn",
    "review":"Harley Quinn quietly broke up with the Joker, got a job, and got a place. But Gotham doesn't know the volatile couple has ended their relationship.  She has kept it quiet because being the Joker's girlfriend has given her protection.  After hearing friends say she will always go back, Harley decides to make the break-up public by blowing up the Ace Chemical plant leaving her J chain behind. While investigating another murder scene committed by the Crossbow Killer, Detective Renee hears about the plant's explosion. With the plant in ruins, Roman wants his crew to bring Harley Quinn to him.  He gives his second-in-command, Victor, and his newly appointed driver, Black Canary, orders to get Cassandra Cain from lockup.  Cassandra Cain is a young pickpocket and Victor was her latest victim.  Inside his pocket was a 30+ carat diamond.  But Roman doesn't want the diamond, he wants the information etched inside.  It has the banking numbers to Gotham's wealthiest crime family. Roman agrees to give Harley a chance to find Cassandra but he won't make it easy.  He put a bounty on Cassandra's head for 1/2 a million dollars, giving Harley plenty of competition. Before the dust settles, Harley will be elbow deep in laxatives, will protect her sentimental objects, and will form the Birds of Prey.<br/><br/>Most of the history between Harley and Joker is explained.  But if you haven't seen the Suicide Squad, most of the subtle jokes will go over your head.  You will have to keep your eyes and ears open for these jokes.  Other clever jokes are thrown into the dialog and scenes. While watching these women kill, maim, and disfigure, they still have conversations about shoes, hair ties, and nail polish.  But DC fans shouldn't worry, Harley Quinn hasn't gone soft. This movie continues the darkness of DC comics with a world of guns, drugs, and blood.  See this movie in theaters to enjoy the choreography of the fight scenes.  And be on time.  Harley narrates her early life before the Joker, leading you to a deeper understanding of her flawed relationships.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Rhythm Section",
    "review":"Lisa, an addict and prostitute, lays down the prices for her next client, Keith. He knows her true identity.  She is Stephanie Patrick.  Three years ago, her entire family was killed in a plane crash. The accidental crash was a cover-up.  Truthfully, there was a bomb on the plane to assassinate liberal Muslim reformer, Abdul Kaif.  Everyone else on the plane was collateral damage. The government knows a college student named Reza created the bomb but covered up the terrorist attack.  They hope Reza can lead them to the orchestrator of the assassination, U-17. Stephanie looks through Keith's evidence and finds information about Reza.  She purchases drugs and a gun, then looks for him.  When she is face to face with Reza, she can't kill him. Later, she discovers Keith was murdered.  She takes his evidence and goes on a mission to find the people responsible for killing her family.  She will need training, money, and bloodlust.<br/><br/>Based on a novel, this movie just doesn't capture your attention.  While realistic about Stephanie's fighting prowess and ability to kill, Stephanie's kills are all by accident or happenstance.  She was able to use her gift of language to find U-17 but not investigate the cover-up.  This movie tries to have Kill Bill moments, Atomic Blonde fight scenes, and the intelligence of Red Sparrow but it all falls short.  It does have the sex appeal of Anna.  This movie should have been available on FandangoNow or Lifetime.  For now, it can be skipped in the theaters.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Gentlemen",
    "review":"Raymond comes home and gets a bottle of liquor when he hears ice rattling behind him.  It's private investigator Fletcher.  Fletcher was hired to find dirt on Raymond's boss, Mickey, for 150,000 pounds.  Fletcher has found a score of information and turned it into a script.  If Raymond pays in 20 million pounds, he can have the script.  Raymond is annoyed by Fletcher but offers to hear him out.  Fletcher starts with his boss Big Dave.  Big Dave hired Fletcher to get dirt on Mickey because Mickey snubbed him at a party in front of some very influential people. Mickey is ready to give up the marijuana business and retire from the mobster lifestyle.  He has decided to sell his operation to Matthew for 400 million. When word gets out that Mickey is going to retire, Dry Eye comes to Mickey to strike a deal.  Mickey thinks Dry Eyes' offer is disrespectful and unapproved by his boss Lord George.  Then, Mickey gets bad news.  One of his stash houses has been robbed and the video is streaming online as a rap video. Mickey knows the underworld sees his retirement as a weakness and everyone is gunning for him, his wife, and his business.  And that's just half of Fletcher's story.<br/><br/>In true Guy Ritchie storytelling, it's not over until it's over.  You have to be at this movie on time or you will miss crucial parts of the setup.  Of course, you can't trust what you see because Fletcher is telling a story for the 1st half of the movie.  The second half is told in real-time and has everyone one-upping each other.  This movie will become an instant cult classic while leaving an ending for part two.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
