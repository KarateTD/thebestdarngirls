    "review": "Steve dreamed of working in the mines, but they won't let children into the dangerous area. Steve grew up and became dissatisfied with his life. Then, he remembered his childhood dream. So, Steve snuck into the mine and found a crystal and an orb. He put the orb into the crystal, and a portal opened to the Overworld. One day, a portal to another dimension opened. Steve and his wolf, Dennis, found a world called Nether. The ruler, Malgosha, had her underlings dig for gold and outlawed creativity. When Steve bonded the orb and crystal, Malgosha saw the beacon. She pulled Steve and Dennis into the Nether. She wants to orb and crystal to access the Overworld and dig for its gold. Steve rubs the orb and crystal under his arm, gives it to Dennis, and tells Dennis to follow his scent to Earth to hide the items. Malgosha keeps Steve in her dungeon until her minions can locate the orb and crystal.<br/><br/>Garrett was the 1989 Hunk City arcade champion. Garrett still acts like a big deal but receives an eviction notice for his store. He attends a storage auction, and the auctioneer hints that an Atari gaming console is in one of the units. Garrett wins the storage unit, but the gaming console is a box with clutter inside, including the orb and crystal. Garrett grabs a few items and drives down the road until his car stalls.<br/><br/>Natalie and her brother, Henry, drive past Garrett. Natalie became Henry's legal guardian after their mother's death. They meet their real estate agent, Dawn, at the house and get their keys. Natalie hopes this will be a new start for both of them.<br/><br/>Henry visits Game Over World before school and meets Garrett. His art teacher tells the students to draw an orange and a banana. Henry draws a banana jet pack with the calculations to make it work. His classmates challenge Henry, and Henry makes it. Before he puts the jet pack on a skeleton, two bullies sabotage it. Henry lights the fuse. The skeleton flies into the potato chip factory and knocks off the mascot. Vice Principal Marlene tells Henry to call his guardian. Henry calls Garrett and pays him to pretend to be his uncle so Natalie won't be angry at him.<br/><br/>Garrett collects Henry and brings him back to the store. Henry looks around and finds the orb and crystal. He puts the two together, and the items guide Henry to the mine. Across town, Natalie panics because Henry is missing. Dawn tells Natalie to use her phone's location feature, and they track Henry to the mine. The portal opens, pulling Henry, Garrett, Natalie, and Dawn inside. Henry quickly adjusts to the world, but Malgosha receives the beacon. She tells Steve to get the orb and crystal, or she will kill Dennis.<br/><br/>Steve arrives in the Overworld and saves the group. However, the crystal broke in the battle. Steve tells the group that another crystal is in the Woodland Mansion. He tells them it's their only way home but doesn't alert them to Malgosha's plan. Will the team make it home, or will Malgosha rule the Overworld?<br/><br/>Inspired by the Minecraft video game, this movie allows the imagination to outshine the dialogue. The worlds are beautifully crafted and respectful of the source material. However, don't try to make sense of what you are watching. Just enjoy the ride. You don't need to know about the video game to understand the film. The overall theme of this adventure film is creators versus destroyers. It's a family film for all. And stay for the post-credit scene for a peek at the sequel.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "A Working Man",
    "review": "Construction foreman Levon sees some men beating his co-worker. Levon fights the men off, and his boss's daughter, Jenny, sees it. She spots his military training because her grandfather was a Green Beret. Levon asks Jenny to keep his secret from her parents. She agrees.<br/><br/>After the weekend, Levon arrives at work and sees police officers leaving his boss's trailer. His bosses, Joe and Carla Garcia, are in tears. Their daughter, Jenny, went partying with her friends on Friday but never came home. Joe could tell Levon was military by Levon's persona. They give Levon $50,000 to find Jenny and promise another 20 for expenses. Levon will find the people who kidnapped Jenny by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Based on Levon's Trade by Chuck Dixon, this movie follows an unassuming man as he kills everyone. The combat scenes are gritty, bloody, and surprisingly funny. However, some characters and plot points feel unnecessary. The conclusion hints at a franchise because one character lusts for revenge. It's not surprising because this is a 12-book series. The movie has guns, hits, and laughs, but a sequel can go straight to streaming.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Death of A Unicorn",
    "review": "Elliot and his daughter, Ridley, drive to Leopold Wilderness Reserve. He takes his eyes off the road when he loses service and hits an animal. Ridley looks back and sees the animal is alive. She exits the car and sees a white unicorn with purple blood. When Ridley sees the unicorn's horn glow, she touches it and has a vision. The images stop when Elliot beats it to death, splattering the blood on their faces. Elliot puts the unicorn in the car and continues to the Leopold Residence.<br/><br/>Elliot introduces Ridley to the Leopolds. Odell and Belinda are a happily married couple with a son, Shepard. Odell hid his cancer diagnosis from their stakeholders and wanted Elliot to be his proxy. Before the Leopolds sign the contract, they want Elliot and Ridley to stay at their home for the weekend.<br/><br/>Ridley looks out the window and sees the car moving. She tries to warn Elliot, but he's too busy with the Leopolds. She walks into the bathroom, washes her face, and sees that her acne is gone. Soon, the Leopolds see their car moving and inspect it. The unicorn breaks out of the vehicle, and Odell's assistant, Shaw, shoots it. Elliot confesses that his eyesight has improved, and his allergies have disappeared. Ridley wants to turn the creature over to the government, but the Leopolds decide to experiment on it.<br/><br/>Ridley stares at pictures of her deceased mother and sees a tapestry with unicorns. She researches the creatures and discovers their dark origins. She runs to the Leopolds, but the unicorn blood works on Odell. His cancer is gone. They ignore Ridley's pleas as folklore. They will pay the price because mommy and daddy are coming for their baby.<br/><br/>This film is funny enough for horror movie haters but could be too campy for horror lovers. The beginning shows the differences between Ridley and Elliot. His focus is on making money to ensure Ridley's future. Each time the Leopolds dangle money before Elliot, he relents to their demands. The Leopolds are the stereotypical oligarchic family. The Leopolds happily sacrifice their staff to gain the unicorn's powers. The graphics are good enough for the genre but become distracting as they interact with real objects. Also, it makes the slaughter scenes more comical than gory. The script feels preachy but breaks it up with enough laughs to not be political. The film is entertaining, but once is enough.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Disney's Snow White",
    "review": "The King and Queen wait patiently for their baby. Then, they gave birth during a blizzard and named their child Snow White. Everything was lovely until the Queen fell ill and died. The King lived in grief until a woman from a faraway land came to the kingdom. Her beauty could create magic, and the King was entranced. He married her. Then, the new Queen warned the King that another village would attack. He gathered his men to fight and never returned. The Queen took the throne and let her true colors shine. Every day, the Evil Queen asked her magic mirror one question: 'Who is the fairest of them all?' The Evil Queen gleamed when it responded that she was the fairest.<br/><br/>Years went by, and the people forgot about Snow White. The Evil Queen thrived while the people withered. One day, Snow White caught Jonathan stealing bread. The Evil Queen tells them to lock him in the dungeon, but Snow White interjects because the punishment isn't fair. The Evil Queen tells the huntsmen to steal Jonathan's coat and shoes. And then tie him to the palace gates. The people will watch him succumb to the elements and learn not to take from the Evil Queen.<br/><br/>Snow White sneaks to the gates, unties Jonathan, and gives him a scrap of bread. In the castle, the Evil Queen questions her magic mirror again. This time, the magic mirror answers that Snow White is the fairest. The Evil Queen can't contain her rage. She summons a huntsman. The Evil Queen tells the huntsman to take Snow White apple picking in the woods. When Snow White is deep in the forest, he should kill her, put her heart in a box, and bring the box to the Evil Queen.<br/><br/>The huntsman takes Snow White into the woods and pulls out a blade. When he lunges at her, she asks him 'why.' He freezes and can't kill her. Snow White stumbles into the woods. And with the woodland creatures' help, she finds a haven but doesn't know it belongs to seven small miners. At the castle, the Evil Queen prompts the magic mirror again. It says Snow White is the fairest. She calls all the huntsman and demands that they find Snow White and bring her immediately. Will Snow White prevail as the fairest and free her people, or will the Evil Queen kill her?<br/><br/>This live adaptation has the foundation of the original but makes a few changes. Snow White is a fair maiden who needs help. While the dwarves and Jonathan rescue her, she saves the kingdom. The film has a few of your favorite songs while adding new tunes. The animators did a superb job bringing the woods to life as Snow White flees. This picture's mistake is in the running time. They added new elements to create a fresh story but bored the audience. Also, the editors attempted to drown out poor singing with loud background music, but it didn't help. This film is better suited for Disney lovers, not obsessers, with money for the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Black Bag",
    "review": "British Intelligence Officer George meets with his boss, Meacham, in an alleyway. Meacham informs George that a nuclear program called Severus leaked. He gives George a list of five people with the knowledge, skill, and clearance level to obtain Severus. George's wife, Kathryn, is on the list. George vows to find the mole in a week.<br/><br/>George returns home and plans a dinner with the suspects. However, he warns Kathryn to avoid one item because it contains drugs. Agents James, Zoe, Freddie, and Clarissa arrive. James and Freddie are field agents. James is in a relationship with agency psychiatrist Dr. Zoe, and Freddie is dating satellite analyst Clarissa. As the drugs take effect, everyone becomes unencumbered and reveals secrets. After everyone leaves, George finds a movie ticket stub for Dark Window in the trash.<br/><br/>George and Kathryn prepare for work. He asks her to go to the movies with him to see Dark Window. She states that she hasn't heard of it. She will be on a mission tomorrow. George inquires about it, but she says, 'Black Bag.' They use the term to hide classified information about their job without lying. However, George wonders if Kathryn lied about the movie. He will investigate his colleagues and the love of his life. Can George uncover the rat and find Severus while keeping his marriage?<br/><br/>This movie is exciting in its simplicity. You don't get constant action like in Mission Impossible but an intriguing mystery with spies like Hercule Poirot. The opening scene has a hypnotizing tracking shot that follows George as he searches for Meacham. Every scene, conversation, and object has a purpose to the enigma. Unlike other thrillers, the script had two impactful meetings that involved all the suspects. The first is a dinner that allows George to probe for information. The second is the unveiling. This meeting is brisk but reveals a lot of information in five minutes. So keep your ears open. This movie will cause many spirited discussions and a few laughs while entertaining. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
