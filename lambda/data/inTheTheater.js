    "mtitle":"The Best of Enemies",
    "review":"After the school for black children is damaged by fire, Ann Atwater demands the city enforce integration.  However, the city board disagrees.  This disagreement causes the NAACP to file a civil rights lawsuit.  To cut them off at the pass, the judge asks Bill to have a charette.  It allows 2 opposing sides to pick an issue and create solutions that's fair to everyone.  Bill picks Ann Atwater for school integration and C.P. Ellis, the head of the K.K.K., to oppose.  Normally picking the co-chairs is the easiest part but for Bill this will be the hardest.  This charette will lead the city on a path to the future.<br/><br/>The most poignant aspect of this movie is that both sides just want to be heard.  Ann Atwater wants equality and will get your attention to get it.  C.P. Ellis wants to keep his way of life and joined the KKK to be heard.  They change each other's heart in the matter of 10 days.  This movie proves that people can come together if we just listen and find common ground.  This is a good movie to see in theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

He doesn't have time to test Billy's worthiness, he will trust that Billy is good and transfer his powers to him.  Billy grows from a 14 year old boy to a 25 year old superhero.  Billy takes it all in vain until Thad and the 7 Deadly Sins come looking for him.  Thad knows Billy, the new Shazam, is the only one that can defeat him.  So, Thad will try to convince Billy to give up his powers or Thad wil kill him.<br/><br/>This movie has a quick wit and a great message about what makes a home and family.  Be aware some scenes may be too much for children under 10.  See it with the family and enjoy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dumbo",
    "review":"Max decides to do something he has never done before: invest.  He buys a pregnant elephant and names it Jumbo.  Her baby, born a few weeks later, is named Jumbo Jr.  But after a circus mishap leads to a stage hand being killed, Jumbo is sold and Jumbo Jr. is renamed Dumbo.  Max believes the Dumbo can bring in money but doesn't know his real secret, Dumbo can fly.  When Max discovers the truth he sees dollar signs.  Then Dumbo goes mainstream and the Vandvere is watching with dollar signs in his eyes too.  Milly and Joe know the best thing for Dumbo is his mother and they will do anything to get her back.<br/><br/>Seeing Dumbo fly in this live action version is astounding but the slow storytelling takes away from the magic.  This will cause your interest and overall caring to fade.  If you have kids, see it matinee.  Otherwise, wait for Redbox.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"During the start of her summer-long community service, Nancy Drew over hears Flora alerting the Sheriff that her house is haunted.  The Sheriff ignores Flora but Nancy is intrigued.  Flora invites her to her home to solve the case.  Can Nancy keep it together when her love ones are on the line?<br/><br/>Nancy Drew fans will delight in this strong telling of the well-known novel.  Nancy is a strong lead character with a supporting cast worth its weight in gold.  Please be advised, some scenes maybe too intense for children under 7.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"June and her mother would create Wonder Park every day.  But when her mom has to leave in order to get better, June destroys Wonder Park and starts to obsess about her father's health.  June's father decides to send her to Math Camp but she escapes when she misinterprets a note from him.  In the woods, June discovers Wonder Park isn't imaginary.<br/><br/>This movie has so many emotions for an 85 minute film.  As you see June's imagination come to life, you wish it were real.  This story is not about overcoming hurt but embracing it to become stronger.  However, if you are with a little one with a sick parent, this movie maybe too much to handle.  3D is not necessary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
