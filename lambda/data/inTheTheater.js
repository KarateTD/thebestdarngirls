    "review": "Linda gives Donovan the company report and rises, following him to the meeting. Donovan stops her and says they downsized the meeting. He leaves, and she hides behind the corner to watch him. He takes the Post-it Note with her name off the report and takes credit for her work. Linda fumes at home with her bird, but resigns to Donovan's behavior. The president of the company passed away, and his son, Bradley, will take over. Before he passed, he told Bradley to promote Linda to a vice president position to reward her years of dedication and service.<br/><br/>Linda beams as she thinks about her future until she hears a co-worker talking about an interoffice memo. It announces Donovan as the next vice president. The rage in Linda boils over, and she charges into Bradley's office. He explains that he objected to his father's opinion because Linda doesn't present well. They have a deal to close in Shanghai. If she can close the deal, he will consider her for the position.<br/><br/>Linda arrives at the hangar and boards Bradley's private jet. She works on the documentation while the men childishly converse. Linda hears them laughing between songs and removes her earbuds. She uncovers that they are laughing at her Survivor audition tape. The flight attendant instructs them to buckle their seatbelts due to incoming turbulence. Bradley, safely in his seat, heckles his friends for following her orders. So, they ignore her and chuckle. The plane crash-lands in the ocean.<br/><br/>Linda wakes on a deserted island. She finds Bradley with a horrible gash on his leg. Bradley wakes up a day and a half later. He demands that Linda follow his orders and build a raft to take them to safety. Linda pauses at his ungrateful nature. Bradley scoffs and reminds Linda that she works for him. Linda chuckles. With her survivalist skills, she is running the show. Will they survive?<br/><br/>This film is for anyone who feels overlooked or underappreciated. Linda is the office misfit. The writers added this to her personality to explain why she desperately seeks friendship and validation. The editor slowly panned over her books as Linda cooked. An eagle-eyed viewer will spot books about survival, tying knots, and poisonous plants. The storyline made Linda conditioned for the outdoors. This trait bubbles over into her work life. This movie fails with its CGI. The crash and boar scenes are distracting and overly digitized. This film's gem is the dialogue. It's witty, dark, and unhinged. This picture is worthy of the big screen.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Solo Mio",
    "review": "Matt finds a letter from his fiancée, Heather. She got cold feet and chose not to go through with the wedding. Matt assumes she's fleeing to the U.S., leaves the venue, and runs to the airport. He feverishly texts Heather, and she admits that she didn't leave Italy. Matt arrives at the hotel and requests to cancel his honeymoon package. The concierge says that's not possible and suggests Matt enjoy the trip alone.<br/><br/>Matt maneuvers around rambunctious children and enters a coffee shop. The owner, Gia, runs out before Matt requests a coffee. Gia returns and gives Matt his wallet. She warns him that the children are pickpockets. They sit and have a lovely conversation. He invites her to the next event, and Gia politely refuses because she has to work. Matt leaves and sits on his tandem bike. Then, Gia's ex-boyfriend, landlord Vincenzo, enters and demands to talk. Gia makes a hasty exit and jumps on Matt's bike. The ride around town, eat, and enjoy each other's company.<br/><br/>Later, Matt sits alone at a restaurant. Newlywed Julian sits in the other seat and questions why Matt is solo. He saw Matt with Gia and thought they were a good match. It doesn't take long for Julian to summarize that someone left Mat at the altar. He wants to be Matt's wingman and help him overcome his hurt. Julian and his wife, Meghan, invite Matt to spend the evening clubbing with them. At the piano bar, Julian introduces Matt to newlyweds, Neil and Donna. Julian urges Matt to drink, dance, and mingle. However, Neil believes Matt should embrace his pain and avoid new relationships. Then, Gia walks into the club. Julian vows to bring the two together. With newfound friends by his side, Matt will discover the beauty in being solo, finding love, and embracing Italian culture.<br/><br/>This movie proves that romantic comedies can be interesting, funny, and charming. Matt isn't a man set on revenge dating. He's genuinely hurting. It breaks his heart to be the odd person out. Julian and Neil are two sides of the same coin. They want the best for Matt, but the writer gave them different approaches. These conflicting styles add a new layer of intelligent comedy to the script. And the conclusion brings a shocking twist that will leave your jaw on the floor. This film is a great date movie that will entertain everyone.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jessie and her uncle bring food and supplies to Mason's lighthouse weekly. Mason watches Jessie exit and board the dinghy. Jessie's uncle screams at her to return to his boat immediately because the water is choppy. Mason observes as a wave capsizes her vessel. He rushes to her aid. He frees Jessie and brings her to shore, but her uncle perishes.<br/><br/>Jessie wakes up with a swollen ankle. One day, he removes her bandages and unveils that she has an infection. Mason leaves his lighthouse and ventures into town. He buys medicine and clothes for Jessie. He exits the store and passes a group of young women filming themselves for social media.<br/><br/>The British government calls in Manafort for a privacy hearing. He implemented an A.I. surveillance program called THEA. They promised the government that it wouldn't collect personal data, but they lied. The government wants Manafort to shut THEA down immediately. The prime minister meets with Manafort privately. She will pull him off surveillance to pacify the government. However, she wants him to operate THEA in the shadows. His assistant, Roberta, is serving as the interim head until a suitable replacement is found.<br/><br/>Roberta's first day is uneventful until they get an alert from THEA. It spotted a terrorist in a woman's post. She sends their Alpha team locate and terminate him immediately. She and her team watch their movements through their body cams as they approach the lighthouse. Before Robert could blink, the man killed them all and escaped with a young woman. Roberta concludes that this man is more than THEA says he is. She tells her team to dig. Mason flees his lighthouse after the attack. He must discover who is after him and why. However, he has to do it with Jessie in tow. Can they escape before MI-6 finds and eliminates them?<br/><br/>This film is the actor's usual genre. It's a kill-them-all movie. The stunts aren't impressive, the storyline is basic, and the conclusion is anticlimactic. The fight scenes have the choreography of a top-notch musical. However, the editing makes it disjointed and dizzying. The director and writer put so much emphasis on physical conflict that the heartfelt dialogue slows down the picture. This movie should have been on streaming, not in theaters.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Greenland 2: Migration",
    "review": "It's been five years since the interstellar comet Clarke hit the Earth, wiping out 75% of the population. The survivors inside the Thule Airbase bunker in Greenland tried to venture out 9 months after the blast. However, the radiation and sporadic debris showers made inhabiting the area impossible. John puts on protective gear and explores the land for supplies while his wife, Allison, works on the board. Their son, Nathan, now 15, attends school with the other kids in the bunker.<br/><br/>John retrieves items from a shipwreck, fixes issues around the bunker, and meets with his therapist. His prolonged exposure to the surface has left him with a cough. Allison has noticed, but John assures her that he's fine. Allison sits with the board and discusses whether they should abandon the bunker and look for greener pastures. Doctor Amina and other scientists determined that Clarke's initial impact point has become an oasis. Then, a debris field hits and crushes the bunker. John, Allison, and Nathan barely escape with their lives. They decide to travel to England, the location of Clark's initial impact. They hope to find the rumored oasis. Will they survive with their family intact?<br/><br/>This sequel follows the same formula as its predecessor. The script shows you how people survive the confines of the shelter. Then, everything collapses. The family escapes one nightmare, but deals with soldiers, looters, insurgents, and terrorists. This pacing keeps the audience entertained and invested. The graphics aren't groundbreaking. However, they blend evenly with the film. The conclusion did try to invoke tears, but that won't happen. This picture lives up to the hype, but it doesn't leave you with an urge to buy.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Mike stands in front of his Alcoholics Anonymous group with his guitar. He celebrates his 20th sober birthday just like his other birthdays, singing 'Song Sung Blue.' After the meeting, Mike arrives at the Wisconsin State Fair with a Hawaiian shirt. He tells his friend, Buddy Holly impersonator Mark, that he can't do Don Ho. Mike wants to go on as himself, Lightning. Mark refuses and reworks the show. Claire, a Patsy Cline impersonator, says Mike would be better at playing Neil Diamond. Claire walks on stage and sings while Mike watches from the crowd.<br/><br/>Mike plays guitar for The Esquires the following day, and Claire dances to the music. They meet afterward for food and talk. They sing together, making beautiful music. Mike admits that impersonating Neil isn't enough. Claire understands that he wants to interpret Neil. They kiss, giving Mike an idea. He is lightning, and she is thunder. They can become Lightning and Thunder: The Neil Diamond Experience. Can this duo rise to fame in Wisconsin?<br/><br/>This script has everything for everyone, including Sweet Caroline. And you don't have to be a Neil Diamond fan to enjoy the movie. In fact, you may discover a new favorite Neil Diamond song. Neil isn't the focal point, just the catalyst that brought these two people together. These actors pull off once-in-a-lifetime performances with an honest portrayal of two people finding strength in each other. This film is a testament to their resilience, families, and pure love of music. It will resonate with the audience and make you believe that love can conquer all. This picture is for movie and music fans alike. While it's not perfect, it's close to it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
