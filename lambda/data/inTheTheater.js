    "mtitle":"Minions: The Rise of Gru",
    "review":"It's career day in 1976, and while some kids dream of being doctors and lawyers, Gru dreams of joining The Vicious Six and becoming a super villain. The Vicious Six members are Belle Bottom, Jean Clawed, Nunchuck, Svengence, and Stronghold, and their leader is Wild Knuckles, Gru's hero. The Vicious Six accepted his application and wants Gru to interview for a spot on their team at Criminal Records tomorrow.<br/><br/>Gru doesn't know that The Vicious Six is looking for a new member because they turned on Wild Knuckles during their last heist. Wild Knuckles risked his life inside a temple to get the stone. The stone will give someone the power of a Chinese zodiac animal on the Chinese New Year. Instead of saving him, Belle Bottom grabs the stone and pushes Wild Knuckles off the plane. With Wild Knuckles dead, they need a new member to complete their team and use the stone to destroy the Anti-Villain League.<br/><br/>In the interview, Gru tells The Vicious Six that he is despicable and ready to join. Awestruck by Gru's age, they tell Gru no and to go to school. During another interviewee's questions, Gru sneaks around The Vicious Six and gets the stone. With The Vicious Six on his tail, Gru gives the stone to his minion, Otto, to take to their lair. They get away and meet with Otto at the hideout. Gru plans to return the stone to The Vicious Six, so they will accept him. Gru asks Otto for the stone, and Otto gives Gru a pet rock. On the way, Otto saw a birthday party, and the birthday boy got a pet rock. Otto fell in love with it and traded it for the stone. Gru walks out to find it, and Kevin sees someone kidnap Gru.<br/><br/>The kidnappers let Gru out of the bag, and Gru sees Wild Knuckles in front of him. Surprised to see Wild Knuckles alive, Gru hands him the pet rock instead of the stone. Wild Knuckles hangs Gru off a balcony and makes a ransom call to the minions. The Vicious Six still think Gru has the stone. Can the Minions save Gru and get the stone?<br/><br/>This movie has something for the entire family, from the opening credits to the mid-credits scene. The soundtrack will have you dancing in your seat with 70's funk, rock, and disco. The storyline is complex but not entirely original. Although the minions don't articulate well, the animators gave them spot-on non-verbal communication. The plot provides a training montage with Master Chow for an easy but fulfilling laugh. See this one in theaters, but 3D isn't necessary.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Black Phone",
    "review":"Finny plays baseball but fails to strike out the opposing team's best pitcher, Bruce. After the game, Bruce compliments Finny, and the teams leave the field. Sometime after, Finny walks to school with his sister, Gwen, and they see a missing person's flyer up for Bruce. Gwen believes The Grabber got Bruce, and he's never coming back.<br/><br/>Finny hides in the bathroom at school, and three bullies come in. They name-call him until Robin walks into the bathroom. As Robin washes Moose's blood off his fist, he warns them not to miss with Finny. At the same time, the principal calls Gwen into his office. She told someone that she had dreams of the missing boys and black balloons. Gwen admits that she has visions in her dreams that come true. The detective gives Gwen his business card in case she has another. Those dreams won't help because The Grabber got Robin.<br/><br/>After school, Gwen leaves to visit a friend, and Finny walks home to look after their dad. Finny sees a man drop his groceries and offers to help. The man snatches Finny off the street using black balloons as a diversion. The man sprays something in Finny's mouth, puts Finny in the car, and drives away.<br/><br/>Finny wakes up on a mattress in a soundproofed concrete room. Finny takes in his surroundings and notices a black phone on the wall. He picks it up to make a call for help but hears nothing. That is, until the phone rings. Finny picks up, but the caller doesn't recall his name. The caller is Bruce. He warns Finny to get out, or The Grabber will kill Finny just like him.<br/><br/>This psychological thriller is not a horror movie as advertised. It goes beyond that and becomes a tale of triumph and strength. Just to let you know, this movie doesn't depict child molestation. However, it displays child abuse. The moment Finny squares his shoulders, you will cheer for him. There are a few jump scares but nothing grotesque. Luckily, the plot doesn't try to get into The Grabber's psyche or make viewers feel empathy for the monster. This story is about Finny growing into a confident young man with help from past victims.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"The ship, also known as the turnip, wakes up Buzz from hypersleep. The ship's sensors detected life on the planet nearby. Buzz wakes Commander Hawthorne to take a closer look at the planet's inhabitants and collect soil samples. They make it back to the ship and try to fly away, but Buzz crashes and cracks their fuel cell, and they don't have another. Til they can create another fuel cell that can get them into hyperspace, the crew can't leave the planet.<br/><br/>The crew created a colony and a new fuel cell within a year, and Buzz boards XL-1 for a four-minute test flight around the sun and back. Buzz gets 60% into hyperspace before the fuel cell dies, and he lands. The trip lasted 4 minutes for Buzz, but it's four years for the colony. To help Buzz acclimate, Hawthorne gives Buzz a robotic therapy cat, Sox. Sox worries about Buzz, but Buzz tells the cat to help by fixing the fuel. Sox says ok.<br/><br/>Fifteen missions later, Buzz comes home to find that Hawthorne died. She left a video message for Buzz with her granddaughter, Izzy, sweetly interrupting. Commander Burnside walks into Hawthorne's old barracks and tells a weeping Buzz that the fuel mission is over. The colony decided to end the space ranger program, stay on the planet, take Sox, and create a laser dome to keep out the planet's dangerous inhabitants. Buzz tells Sox the mission is over, and Sox is disappointed because he figured out the formula. So Buzz grabs Sox, creates the fuel cell, and steals a ship. Buzz and Sox accomplish their mission and land on the planet but can't land on the colony because of the laser dome. Buzz finds the safest landing spot, and someone in a suit approaches him and tells Buzz to be quiet. The person in the suit sees Buzz's name tag and tells him that her name is Izzy, Hawthorne's granddaughter. It's been 22 years since Buzz left.<br/><br/>Since then, an enemy spacecraft came to the planet with a legion of robots. Their commander is the evil Emperor Zurg. After Zurg arrived, his army waged a constant attack on the laser dome. Izzy remembers the stories about Buzz and knows he is the missing link to Operation Surprise Party. They will take out the mothership controlling the robots to save the colony. But they need Buzz to get them to Zurg's spacecraft. Buzz respects Izzy's lineage, but he doesn't work with rookies. While Buzz doesn't want their help, he will need it to save the colony, defeat Zurg, and redefine his mission.<br/><br/>In 1995, Andy got a toy inspired by his favorite movie. Lightyear is the movie. So this adaptation isn't a remake or a sequel; it's a prequel for Andy's world in Toy Story 1. Pixar animators did a stunning job creating a colonized world on a dangerous planet. And their space animation is second to none. While creating a world of space travel, animators included geometry. Yes, Buzz is a mathlete. And let's not forget the quiet love letter Pixar sent to classic Nintendo fans. While this is an animation, the complex storyline is for 1995 Toy Story fans, not their kids. However, its action and jokes will entertain parents and their children.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Jurassic World: Dominion",
    "review":"After Maisie freed the dinosaurs, the humans and animals must find a way to co-exist. Claire forms the Dinosaur Protection Group to save them from poachers, breeders, and dinosaur fighters. She reports the violators to the authorities, who send the animals to Biosyn. Biosyn created a sanctuary in Italy for the animals and now researches them to develop pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>Doctor Ellie Sattler arrives at a cornfield infested with locusts. The bugs are enormous and carry a genome from the Jurassic era. Ellie uncovers the locusts didn't ravage the neighbor's crops and ask why. The farmer tells Ellie the neighbor uses Biosyn seeds.<br/><br/>At a dig site, Ellie catches up with Doctor Alan Grant. He looks over the insect after catching up with Ellie. He determines that her suspicions are correct and the bug is genetically modified. Ellie believes Biosyn created the insects to manufacture a global food crisis with their crop being the only food source. Ellie wants to go to Biosyn and investigate for evidence. Ellie tells Alan not to worry because she has a friend on the inside: Dr. Ian Malcolm.<br/><br/>On the outskirts of Alaska, Claire and Owen privately raise Maisie because the world knows she released the dinosaurs. Maisie sees a small velociraptor in the woods with Blue's markings. It's Blue's child, but Maisie can't figure out how Blue had a baby with no males around. She names the small velociraptor Beta and feeds it.<br/><br/>As Owen surveys the property, he hears Blue's cries for help. He sees Rainn, a poacher, kidnapping Beta. Owen looks up and sees a woman grabbing Maisie and pulling her into a van. Owen runs home to tell Claire that Beta and Maisie are gone, and they prepare to help. Owen explains to Blue that the kidnappers have his kid too. He promises to bring Beta back, and Blue roars and leaves. Rainn stole Beta and Maisie with a purpose. Doctor Henry Wu needs them and their genetic makeup to fix his mistake and save the planet. The past and the future will collide to reveal the evil plan behind the lies of benevolence that is Biosyn.<br/><br/>The screenwriters attempted a massive feat by bringing the franchise's past and present characters together along with the dinosaurs. It does help to watch Jurassic Park, Jurassic World, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom to understand each character's backstory and the movie's easter eggs. With Now This News commentary, the film attempts to give a brief overview of the prequel's major plot points, but you don't get an understanding of the character's arcs. The CGI department created thrilling new dinosaurs and improved fan favorites. This movie falls flat because it's the same underlying story: two lost kids are inside a business with no respect for mother nature. This movie is thrilling, but nothing will top the first.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
