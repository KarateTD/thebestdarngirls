    "mtitle": "Anaconda",
    "review": "Actor Griff mopes around a studio after a director fires him. He sees an Anaconda movie poster and gets an idea. He calls his old friend, Doug, and leaves a message. In high school, Doug would direct and write films, and Griff would act in them. They were supposed to move to LA together, but Doug got cold feet.<br/><br/>Doug is a wedding videographer. He hates the cheesy productions, but they pay the bills. He enters his house and finds a surprise party awaiting him. He greets his friend, Claire. She is a divorced attorney. Doug smiles when he sees Griff. He has the ultimate present. He found an old copy of Doug's first film, The Quinch, stuck in his mom's VCR. They play the tape, and everyone loves it.<br/><br/>Doug meets Griff, Claire, and their friend, Kenny, for lunch. Griff got the rights to their favorite movie, Anaconda. He wants to travel to the Amazon for 3 weeks and remake the film. Griff wants Doug to direct and write, Kenny to shoot it, and Claire to be his co-star. After a few days, Doug caves and chooses to do the project.<br/><br/>They travel to the Amazon and meet with their snake wrangler, Santiago. They find their vessel at the dock, but the captain isn't there. Ana says her father couldn't make it, but the boat needs repairs. They beg her to take them instead. Ana sees the men chasing her approaching, and she relents to the film crew's demands to save herself. Griff and Doug think they are going to make Anaconda. However, they are about to live it. Who will survive?<br/><br/>Whether you call this a remake, a re-imaging, or a reboot, it's a funny and scary good time. The film has some parallels with the source material. However, it's special and a future cult classic. The script takes jabs at itself and Hollywood without being mean. And fans of the original get surprise cameos. The jump scares are properly timed and don't take away from the humor and friendship. Eagle-eyed viewers should watch for the Jurassic Park moment. The audience should stay for the mid-credit scenes to get another laugh. While you may not buy this film, you will watch it again on streaming for the jokes you missed. This picture isn't perfect, but it's a mindless, good time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Housemaid",
    "review": "Millie arrives at the Winchester Estate, and Nina Winchester greets Millie with a smile and hor d'oeuvres. Nina examines Millie's résumé and qualifications. She reiterates that the position is a live-in maid. Nina confesses that she's expecting but hasn't told her husband, Andrew, or daughter, CeCe. Millie thinks everything is wonderful. Nina expresses that she has more applicants to interview before choosing a housemaid. But she will call Millie back soon.<br/><br/>Millie drives away, removes her glasses, and rolls her eyes. She never expects to hear from Nina again. Millie is on probation for 5 years after serving 10 years in prison. She knows one background check will rule her out. Millie takes showers in gas station bathrooms, applies for any job, and sleeps in her car. When her phone rings, it's Nina offering Millie the job. She wants Millie to start as soon as possible, and Millie is willing to do so this afternoon. Millie thinks her prayer has been answered. She has a steady job, a paycheck, and a place to live. Her probation officer will be pleased. However, Millie has no idea the danger lurking behind the iron gate.<br/><br/>Based on The Housemaid by Freida McFadden, this film is a wild ride that plays with motifs, surroundings, and wardrobe to convey deeper meanings. The house is void of color except for one bathroom with snake wallpaper. Nina always wears a hue of white until the telling ending. She's seen as clean, perfect, and pure. Millie and Andrew stain on the screen as they wear darker wardrobes. The different angles show the power dynamic shift throughout the film. It will leave you dizzy. Also, the split screens and overlays of different people experiencing the same turmoil are jaw-dropping. This film will make you want to read the book and compare it. It's pragmatic, cultural, and surprising.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Ella McCay",
    "review": "Lieutenant Governor Ella McCay approaches her office when her secretary, Estelle, hands Ella a letter. A reporter wants exclusive access to her. If not, he will release damaging information he has about her and her husband, Ryan. Ella pushes the matter aside and jumps in her vehicle. Her driver, Trooper Nash, drives Ella to her aunt's bar. Aunt Helen raised Ella since she was 16 and has been the voice of reason for Ella. Helen's advice is to dump the dead weight: Ryan. Ella refuses because he's provided a sense of fun for her.<br/><br/>Ella returns to work, and Governor Bill is waiting in her office. The President chose Bill as the next Secretary of the Interior, and Bill will name Ella the acting governor immediately. While Ella is good at passing legislation, she isn't well-liked amongst constituents. Ella believes she can win them over with her tooth tutor and well baby legislation. Bill shakes his head, stands up, and grabs the doorknob. He lets Ella go first and announces her promotion. Ella shies away from the camera as Ryan smiles for the it, grabs her, and dances with her. She wants to do good for her state, but life will happen.<br/><br/>Ella McCay is a smartly-written film about family, relationships, and politics. The plot teaches micro lessons in civics while entertaining. Ella is highly capable and intelligent. However, she has anchors pulling her down. Sadly, she doesn't see how her two biggest pitfalls mirror each other until it's too late. The cast did a stellar job of acting with little dialogue. They let their facial expressions and hand gestures convey the message. At the conclusion, this picture will encourage you to scream healthily.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Avatar: Fire and Ash",
    "review": "After Neteyam's death, Neytiri and Jake debate what to do with Spider. Neytiri, unable to bear Spider's resemblance to those who killed her son, wants him gone, while Jake hesitates. That night, Spider's mask fails, and he begins gasping, prompting a frantic search for his spare mask. They save him for the moment, but Jake realizes the replacement mask will also eventually fail. When the Wind Traders arrive in Metkayina, Jake decides to bring Spider back to the humans for his safety.<br/><br/>Jake, Spider, and the family travel with the Wind Traders toward the RDA ship. En route, the Mangkwan, or Ash People, attack their aircraft. Amidst the chaos, Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak are separated from the group. Spider's mask battery runs low, and his spare batteries are with the wreckage. Spider collapses. Kiri lays him down, links her queue to the ground, and puts a bug in his mouth. Spider miraculously recovers. Colonel Miles witnesses this and becomes determined to capture his son and bring him to RDA for study. Jake knows that if Miles gains access to this miracle, humans will become unstoppable. The coming battle will result in heavy loss, two new unions, and new life for Pandora.<br/><br/>The third installment of the Avatar franchise focuses on the action while building the Pandora lore. The graphics draw you into Na'vi's world with motion and colors that were meant for 3D, and the score teleports the audience into each breathtaking adventure. While nothing will ever top this first, this film towers above the second in every category. This film has no mid-credit or end-credit scenes. If you are a fan of the first two, then you must see this one in theaters and in 3D with the best sound.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Zootopia 2",
    "review": "Partners Judy and Nick became famous for saving Zootopia from a civil war. However, Chief Bogo thinks it was a fluke because they are different. Bogo presents their latest case to the squad. It's a crooked dock inspector. He gives the team their assignments and puts Nick and Judy on observation. However, they aren't there. Officer Clawhauser informs Bogo that Nick and Judy are on the scene and took the lead.<br/><br/>The bust becomes a TV spectacle, putting Judy and Nick in the hot seat. Judy tries to explain that she found snakeskin in one of the crates, but Bogo won't listen. Besides, reptiles haven't been in Zootopia in 100 years. That's when they created the weather wall. Judy discovers that the culprit will be attending the Zootenial Gala. Zootopia's founder, Ebenezer Lynxley, will be honored at the event. His family will display his journal, which contains the idea and blueprints for Zootopia.<br/><br/>Judy convinces Nick to attend the gala undercover. Judy bumps into Pawbert Lynxley, Ebenezer's grandson, and he's smitten with her. His father, Milton, runs the family business and upholds the legacy with his other two children, Kitty and Cattrick. Nick shines a light on the culprit before they grab the journal and try to run away. Judy and Nick follow them into a private room and remove their cloak. It's Gary De'Snake. He tells Judy they aren't the bad guys and the journal can prove it. Before Gary reads the journal, Milton, Kitty, and Cattrick kick open the doors. Bogo barges into the room, and Gary accidently bites him with one of his fangs. Judy breaks it and holds it in her hand. When the other officers enter, Milton says Judy, Nick, and Gary attempted to kill Bogo. They escape before the police arrest them, but they are enemy number one. Can Judy and Nick clear their name while helping Gary uncover the truth?<br/><br/>This sequel is clever, endearing, and funny. It covers perception, smear campaigns, history washing, and forced migration with ease and compassion. During these hard-hitting topics, the script tackles the partnership between Judy and Nick. The animation rivals the first film. Disney manages to give the animals human-like qualities while displaying their unique animalistic characteristics. This installment expands the animal world while rooted in its core cast. The beginning recaps what happened in the first film, so you don't have to see it to enjoy this. The end-credit scene gives the viewer a hint at what is to come. See Zootopia 2 with the whole family today.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
