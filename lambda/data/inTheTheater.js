	"review":"Arthur turned his back on Atlantis after the king killed his mother out of jealousy.  Now, his half brother, Orm, threatens the surface world.  Arthur must find a legendary trident and reclaim his birthright as king.  This movie is an example of well-meaning actors and great graphics meeting a bad script.  No need to stay past the end credits.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"After crashing into a military training exercise, B-127's voice box is removed and its memory is wiped out.  Charlie finds the Autobot and names it Bumblebee.  But the Decepticons are not far behind.  A heartwarming tale that has more in common with the cartoon than the old movie franchise.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"In 24 hours, Miles Morales is bitten by a radio active spider, witnesses the death of Spider-Man, is hunted, and discover 5 other Spider-Men.  Each Spider-Man has their own back story, but they have one thing in common: Being a reluctant superhero.  Miles will sadly join this club.  Seeing the seemless mesh of different animation styles with a strong story and great life lessons for kids is superb.  Stay pass the end credits and look out for Stan Lee.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

	"review":"Dr. Shirley hires Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga to drive him for his tour in the deep south.  Seeing prejudice there uncovers the prejudice feelings in themselves.  This movie is Oscar worthy with enough heart and life lessons to carry with you for a lifetime.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

It's hard to believe that people still fight to be the favourite of those in power today.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
