    "mtitle":"Drive-Away Dolls",
    "review":"It's 1999 and Marian goes to a bar. She can't find her friends, Sukie and Jamie. Then, she hears Jamie on the microphone offering to let everyone do body shots. Jamie's girlfriend, Sukie, gets upset and punches Jamie. Jamie wants a road trip to clear her mind and forget her break-up. Marian wants to travel to Tallahassee to visit her aunt. Jamie convinces Marian to travel together in a drive-away car.<br/><br/>Drive-away shop owner Curlie receives a call. The caller wants his Dodge driven by two people to Tallahassee, and they will be there today. Curlie accepts the job before Marian and Jamie enter. They tell him they want to go to Tallahassee. So he gets contact information from Marian and Jamie and gives them the keys to the Dodge. And they drive away.<br/><br/>Arliss and Flint enter the shop and request the Dodge, going to Tallahassee. Curlie tells them he gave the job to two women. And they call their boss, Chief. Chief calmly demands the women's information. Chief tells them they must find the two women and get the car. It holds two deadly and life-ruining secrets inside. Will Marian and Jamie make it to Tallahassee before Arliss and Flint find them?<br/><br/>This movie takes time to build but exponentially ramps up the wildness. While the plot is crazy and raunchy, the 70s acid trips make a late 90s film feel disjointed. It's not until the last 20 minutes that you understand the meaning of the trippy and unnecessary flashbacks. If you are open-minded and want to watch a wild time, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Madame Web",
    "review":"In 1973, a pregnant Constance Webb searched the Peruvian Amazon rainforest for a spider with her partner Ezekiel Sims. As they march through the forest, Ezekiel questions Constance about the local legends. The indigenous people believe some spider-like men, called Las Arañas, troll the rainforest for wrongdoers. Constance laughs because she is a woman of science, not legends. Constance finds the spider and celebrates with the locals. Then, Ezekiel starts shooting and takes the spider. Constance goes into labor, and Las Arañas come from the trees. They place the spider on her chest as she delivers, and it bites her. She dies, but her daughter, Cassie, survives.<br/><br/>Cassie grew up in foster care and became an NYFD paramedic. She drives the ambulance to save a woman's life and almost runs into a prep school girl on a skateboard. Cassie and her partner, Ben, get the woman to the hospital in time, and the doctors save her life. The woman's stepdaughter thanks Cassie. Cassie returns home and walks past the landlord, arguing with her neighbor about back rent. She looks through some of Constance's notes before relaxing.<br/><br/>Cassie has a near-death experience before Ben saves her. Afterward, she keeps experiencing dèjá vu. Cassie believes this is a coincidence until Cassie has a vision about a co-worker, O'Neil, dying. She runs by his side, but it's too late. Her vision came true.<br/><br/>Cassie travels to attend O'Neil's funeral at the last minute and runs to the train station. She boards the train and has a vision of a man murdering three teenagers. She screams at the teens to leave the train when she spots the man walking toward them. Cassie tells the three teens to jump in the cab she steals. She realizes she recognizes the three teens. Julia is the stepdaughter of the woman Cassie saved. Anya lives in Cassie's building, and Mattie is the skateboarder. However, she doesn't know the man trying to kill them. It's Ezekiel. He allowed the spider to bite him in 1973. Now, he has superhuman strength and can see the future. He saw Julia, Anya, and Mattie with powers, killing him. He is determined to find and kill them before they get their powers. Can Cassie gain control of her powers and save Anya, Mattie, and Julia so they can fulfill their destiny?<br/><br/>This movie spends its time on character development and intrigue. For a moment, Cassie has a brief encounter with the teens. Once Cassie has a second to talk to them, they find a common thread: abandonment. The villain is ruthless and deserves more backstory. The director bravely chooses not to differentiate Cassie's visions from the real world at the start. As her bond with the ladies grows, the audience can see the change between Cassie's visions and the present. Be sure to pay attention because you will witness the birth of someone amazing. There are 0 mid- or post-credit scenes. This film is for you if you like character-driven superhero films with less action. Otherwise, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Bob Marley: One Love",
    "review":"In 1976, Bob Marley and the Wailers met with reporters about their upcoming free concert in Jamaica. Some say that Bob's concert will strengthen the divide, but Bob maintains that he isn't picking a side. He wants to bring everyone peacefully together.<br/><br/>Bob plays with his friends and family and travels to practice before the concert. Bob's wife, Rita, sings background vocals but leaves to take care of things before the show. Rita sees several men approaching the house with guns. Before she can warn Bob and the band, a man shoots her in the head. The men run inside and shoot anyone moving. Bob and Rita survive their wounds and perform the concert two days later. He tells Rita to take the children and stay with Rita's mother in America while he records his next album in London. Soon, Bob wants to perform in Africa, but Rita worries his pursuits are pulling focus away from Jamaica. After financial disputes, domestic issues, and health problems, Bob will discover that delivering the message isn't enough. He has to become the message.<br/><br/>This film only covers a few years of Marley's life in detail. The documentary doesn't try to glamorize Bob or paint him as a hero. They allow the audience to see his motivation, artistic process, and determination. Also, it props up Rita's involvement in Bob's personal and professional life. Viewers will learn more about the man, his music, and his relationships.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Argylle",
    "review":"Elly Conway reads excerpts from her beloved Argylle series at a book signing. She promises the fifth book in the series is almost complete. Elly returns home to her cat, Alfie, and types the last chapter in the book. She sends the book to her mother, Ruth, before bed.<br/><br/>Elly wakes up and video calls Ruth for Ruth's opinion. Ruth thinks the book is compelling but doesn't like the ending. After Agent Argylle escapes his nemesis, LaGrange, with the help of his tech expert, Kira, LaGrange kills Kira. LaGrange rides away on a motorcycle. Agent Wyatt halts LaGrange's getaway and holds her for Argylle. She exposes their boss, Ritter, as the mole in the Directive before sacrificing herself. There is a master file in London of all the double agents, and Argylle will fly there to get it. And that's how the book ends. Elly calls it a cliffhanger, but Ruth says it's a copout. She wants Elly to write another chapter about Argylle going to London for the list.<br/><br/>Elly makes a last-minute decision to take a train to her parents' home because she hates flying. She puts Alfie in a cat pack and tries to hide from onlookers. After a while, Aidan recognizes her and openly admires her work. Then, he warns the next fan will attack her. Aidan battles several spies on the train and overcomes them all. He gives Elly the signal as he opens the emergency door on the train and they parachute out. Elly passes out on the way down.<br/><br/>Elly wakes up in Aidan's safe house. The authentic Directive intercepted Elly's manuscript because some of her stories materialized. However, the Directive thinks Elly is the key to finding the master list the tech wizard hid inside a silver bullet flash drive. The actual Agent Argylle was on his way to retrieve it in London. However, the agent went missing. Aidan wants Elly to use her writing skills and write the next chapter to predict what happened to the agent and the master list. Can Elly write for her life like she does for her fans?<br/><br/>This movie's vigorous start has sexy dances, car chases, and battles. Then, it switches to Elly's quiet life. Viewers watch her dream up her character's situations, dialogue, and backstory. The film hits its comical stride when Aidan approaches Elly on the train. And the script provides several big twists to pique your interest. However, the final fight scene is ridiculous and borders on a sad rom-com. This scene distracts from the audience's suspense and gives you the urge to leave. However, the movie has one mid-credits scene to tie in with the director's other films.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
