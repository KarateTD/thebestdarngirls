    "review":"It's Wednesday the 11th, and four teens sit on a patio and compare tales about the Blissfield Butcher. Within minutes, only one teen is alive, and she is running for her life.  The girl's father collects antiques, and one is the La Dola knife.  After the butcher kills his last victim, the knife speaks to him, and he takes it.  Thursday the 12th, Millie tries to sit and eat with her mother, Coral, and her sister, Officer Char. School should be a solace for Millie but it's not.  She does have her two best friends, Nyla and Josh, but other students and her shop teacher belittle her every day.  Millie gets a mass text about the four murdered students but prepares for the homecoming game. After the homecoming game, Millie tells Josh and Nyla that Coral is late and should be coming soon.  After waiting an hour, Millie calls her mom, and Char picks up the phone.  Their mom is passed out drunk.  Before Char finishes speaking, Millie's phone dies.  Millie looks up and sees a man in a mask with a knife.  The butcher catches up to her and stabs her with the La Dola knife in the shoulder, but he gets a wound in the same place.  Then, Char fires her gun in the air and the butcher runs away.  Millie is safe and suffers a minor stab wound.  Friday the 13th, Millie wakes up on a dirty mattress on the floor with horror all around her. Then, she realizes she is in the butcher's body.  Millie makes her way to the school and convinces Josh and Nyla of her true identity. The knife is a ceremonial sacrificial knife.  If a sacrifice isn't made, they will swap bodies.  After the swap, they have 24 hours to swap back or it will be permanent.  They realize they have 8 hours left to find the butcher, get the knife, and stab him before Millie is the butcher forever.<br/><br/>Remember the good old days, when you walked into a movie and expected nothing. Just to have a good time, a few laughs, and some decent jump scares.  Well, this is your movie. This mix of Freaky Friday and Chucky provides the good nature, albeit gruesome releases needed.  For those afraid of horror movies, the film provides you with victims who deserve to die.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"George and Margaret work on their Montana ranch with the help of their son, James, and James's wife, Lorna, and their baby, Jimmy.  Margaret looks outside the window and sees James's horse, but no James.  George finds James dead on a pile of rocks next to a creek.  Three years later, George and Margaret attend Lorna and Donnie Weboy's wedding. A few days later, Margaret sits in her car outside the grocery store and sees Donnie, Lorna, and Jimmy walking while eating ice cream cones.  Then, Donnie laughs at Jimmy because he dropped his ice cream.  When Jimmy refuses Donnie, Donnie hits Jimmy.  Lorna comes to Jimmy's defense, and Donnie hits her too.  They leave.  Margaret doesn't tell George what she saw at the grocery store.  Instead, she makes a cake and takes it to Donnie's home, but the family is gone. Margaret comes home and prepares for a trip.  When George gets home, he knows something is wrong. Margaret believes Lorna can't defend herself and their grandson.  So Margaret will get Jimmy back. George closes his suitcase, and they head down the road.  George and Margaret don't know the Weboy Family is powerful in North Dakota.  The matriarch, Blanche, rules with an iron fist, shotgun, and a lit cigarette. She will never let any of the Weboys walk away again, including Jimmy.<br/><br/>Based on Let Him Go by Larry Watson, this movie is a slow burn but picks up at the end.  Just a warning, some scenes can be pretty gruesome.  But what you are witnessing is three mothers fighting for the boy they love. In the end, it all comes down to Jimmy and how much people are willing to sacrifice to keep him. Viewers get a Kill Bill Vol. 2 moment, and it's worth it.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
