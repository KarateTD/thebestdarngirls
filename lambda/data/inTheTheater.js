    "review":"During the start of her summer-long community service, Nancy Drew over hears Flora alerting the Sheriff that her house is haunted.  The Sheriff ignores Flora but Nancy is intrigued.  Flora invites her to her home to solve the case.  Can Nancy keep it together when her love ones are on the line?<br/><br/>Nancy Drew fans will delight in this strong telling of the well-known novel.  Nancy is a strong lead character with a supporting cast worth its weight in gold.  Please be advised, some scenes maybe too intense for children under 7.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Wonder Park",
    "review":"June and her mother would create Wonder Park every day.  But when her mom has to leave in order to get better, June destroys Wonder Park and starts to obsess about her father's health.  June's father decides to send her to Math Camp but she escapes when she misinterprets a note from him.  In the woods, June discovers Wonder Park isn't imaginary.<br/><br/>This movie has so many emotions for an 85 minute film.  As you see June's imagination come to life, you wish it were real.  This story is not about overcoming hurt but embracing it to become stronger.  However, if you are with a little one with a sick parent, this movie maybe too much to handle.  3D is not necessary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Stella has Cystic Fibrosis and follows her regimen to the letter.  Will has CF but he got an incurable bacteria making him ineligible for a transplant, so he ignores his treatments.  Due to these bacterias, it is required for patients with CF to stay 6 feet apart.  Once Stella finds and loses love, she decides to reclaim 1 foot.  When Will has to choose between killing Stella or letting her die, what will he choose?<br/><br/>Based on a novel, this movie will make you misty-eyed.  While it's a heartbreaking ending, it's the most honest.  And it proves that love can overcome anything.  Even, itself.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In 2020, aliens invaded and killed our power grid.  To get it back, we created an alliance.  If we work for them, they won't kill us.  Anyone who disrupts the order is taken off planet.  Gabriel has created a plan to escape but he will go through hell to get there.<br/><br/>This movie mixes an alien movie with Greek mythology.  The viewers will spend most of the movie wondering what's going on and who's in control.  You won't know until the last 20 minutes but the ride is worth it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Captain Marvel",
    "review":"Vers is excited to be granted her first mission by the Supreme Intelligence.  During the battle between the Kree and the Skrulls, Vers is captured and put into a mind hacking machine.  The Skrulls uncover memories she thought were dreams.  She escapes the machine and jumps into an escape pod that veers off course to C-53, a.k.a. Earth.  On earth, Vers will learn the truth about her powers, the Kree, and the Skrulls.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the MCU need to watch the other films before watching this movie.  There are a lot of jokes and references to the past and present that will not make sense without knowledge of these movies.  With so much history to cover before the initial story, the first 10 minutes feels extremely rushed.  If you miss it, you will miss everything.  And 90s babies, be ready for some nostalgia.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
