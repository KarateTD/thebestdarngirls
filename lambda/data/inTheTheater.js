    "mtitle":"Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway",
    "review":"All the people and the animals gather on the McGregor farm to watch Thomas and Bea marry. The animals have agreed that they can eat anything on the farm, but they can't touch Tom's tomatoes. But Thomas keeps a watchful eye on the rambunctious Peter.  One day, Bea gets a letter from Nigel Basil-Jones, a publisher that wants to distribute her latest book.  So, Bea and Thomas pack up the rabbits and meet with Nigel. Nigel promises to keep the integrity of the book but wants a label for the rabbits.  He labels Peter as the villain. Shocked, Peter walks away and finds Barnabas stealing peaches.  Barnabas recognizes something in Peter, then recollects that he knew Peter's father. The two go on a spree of chaos, and a pet store captures them.  But this was all a part of Barnabas's plan.  Once a little girl buys them and takes them home, Barnabas and Peter rob the family. Barnabas starts to talk about his grand plan but stops when he hears Bea and Thomas calling for Peter.  Back at the farm, Peter tells this family about Barnabas and his crew.  Peter wants to go back and help him with the big score.  Barnabas wants to rob the farmers market, not for fresh fruit but dried fruit. Peter is ready to take on the villain role and do bad things.<br/><br/>The sequel to Peter Rabbit and based on Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter makes fun of itself multiple times throughout the movie.  Anything you would call absurd, they do it before the scene plays out.  This prediction allows children to love the action while not being taken too seriously by adults. As you see the characters change in Bea's drawings, it will strike a chord in your heartstrings.  See this movie as a matinee with your kids for an easy laugh.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"In The Heights",
    "review":"The neighborhood of Washington Heights has people with dreams in every home.  Usnavi runs the bodega and plans to go to Puerto Rico to re-open his father's bar. Every morning, Usnavi greets Abuela Claudia.  With no kids, Claudia helped raise every kid in Washington Heights. In his bodega, Usnavi sells coffee, food, and lotto tickets to his neighbors, like Kevin, Nina, Benny, and his crush, Vanessa.  Kevin owns a car service and anxiously awaits the arrival of his daughter, Nina, after selling half of his store to send her to Stanford.  Nina is happy to be back on her block, but she worries that her news will disappoint the neighborhood.  Sonny, Usnavi's cousin, works in the bodega and dreams of going to college, but he is too young to understand the obstacle in his way.  Benny works for Kevin and has a crush on Nina. Vanessa wants to move out of Washington Heights and start a fashion label, but she needs to wait for a credit approval to get her dream apartment downtown.  Whether their dream is on the A-train, in the neighborhood, or on another island, they will not stop until they reach it.  Good thing someone has a winning 96,000 dollar lotto ticket in their hands.<br/><br/>Dare you to watch this movie without a tear in your eye.  Based on the award-winning play, someone in this movie will resonate with you.  Their passion, strength, and pride will pull you into each character's story while seeing them dance and sing about their struggles and joy. The music and lyrics will have you dancing and singing along. Like their dreams, each subject is complex and unique.  While they all grew up in the same neighborhood, they are not the same people. If musicals aren't your style, you should still give this one a try.  It will open you to an experience and mindset that many ignore.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Spirit Untamed",
    "review":"Lucky Prescott grew up under the watchful eye of her aunt, Cora, and grandfather.  Even with Cora's due diligence, Lucky broke the rules one too many times.  So, Cora believes Lucky should live with her father, Jim, again.  Jim owns the train in the sleepy town of Miradero and sent Lucky to live with Cora after her mother, Milagro, died.  On her first day in Miradero, Lucky walks into the Granger Corral.  Lucky can't take her eyes off the horse stunt riders because she never knew horses could move that way. On the way to Jim's home, a little boy, Snips, offers Lucky and Cora a ride for a penny. Before Cora could respond, Snips's sister, Abigail, hogged-tied him and introduced herself to the ladies.  At Jim's home, he is excited to have Cora and Lucky back. Lucky leaves the house and goes to the horse enclosure.  Inside the barn, Lucky can hear a thunderous racket.  Pru Granger, a young rider, explains that the men are breaking in a horse. One of the men is Henry, and he saved Lucky's life when she almost fell off the train. Lucky names the horse Spirit.  She claims Spirit and works to break it in.  On their first trust exercise, Spirit breaks free and finds his herd in the woods.  Lucky admires them until she hears Henry in the background with his gang.  They round up Spirit's herd and load them onto a train.  Henry plans on loading the horses onto a boat and selling them for hard labor.  Lucky refuses to let this happen.  She convinces Pru and Abigail to join her, and they decide to cut Henry off before he makes it to the boat.  The PALs will have to band together to survive Heck Mountain and the Ridge of Regret.<br/><br/>Based on Spirit Riding Free by Aury Wallington and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron by John Fusco, this movie makes up for an average storyline with solid comedic timing and timeless jokes.  One endearing point of this movie, Lucky, Abigail, and Pru never turn on each other when things get tough.  While Dreamworks produced the movie, it doesn't have the same animation quality as How To Train Your Dragon or The Croods. This film is an enjoyable matinee movie for the whole family.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Cruella",
    "review":"Estella was the odd girl out from birth.  With her natural black and white hair, she was born to stand out.  Her mother, Katherine, helped nurture her love of fashion but observed Estella had a mean streak.  She told her daughter that her name was Estella, not Cruella. At school, Estella became a bully magnet, but she gave as good as she got. With Estella's violent reputation, Katherine decides to travel to London for a fresh start.  But first, Katherine has to visit a friend to get some money.  Outside Hellman House, Katherine gives Estella her necklace, a family heirloom, and tells Estella to wait in the car with Buddy, her dog.  When Buddy escapes, Estella follows him into the house.  Inside, Estella finds the glamour of a Winter Fashion Show.  Soon, security discovers Estella and throws her out with dalmatians chasing after her. The dalmatians jump over her and hit Katherine, pushing her off a cliff. Estella runs to London, but later, sees the necklace is gone.  On her first day there, she meets Jasper and Horace, two street kids with no parents. They decide to team up, but she has to dye her unmistakable hair first.  Ten years later, Estella uses her love of fashion to create disguises for them as they rob the town.  However, Jasper observes Estella staring at the Liberty of London store sign all the time.  So, he steals an application acceptance for her.  Estella believes she is on the right path to being the woman Katherine wanted.  However, this is the first step of introducing the world to Cruella de Vil and her poetic justice for her necklace, fashion, and Katherine.  The Baroness, the Liberty of London's owner and famed fashion designer, has met her match.<br/><br/>Based on The One Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith and Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians by Bill Peet, this movie is a feast for your eyes and ears.  With eye-popping fashion and a host of colors, Cruella's black, white, and red stand out like her hair. This soundtrack follows the format of Guardians of the Galaxy while being a nod to the era. You will laugh at the Baroness's psychotic actions, but secretly, you will want to be her, all the while wanting Cruella to destroy her. Sit back with the family and enjoy Disney's newest classic with a captivating plot twist.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Those Who Wish Me Dead",
    "review":"After seeing his friend's home turned into an arson target, Owen takes cash out of his bank account, grabs his son, Connor, gets in his car, and drives away.  Owen decides to go to Ethan's house.  Ethan is Owen's brother, the sheriff of a small town, and has a baby on the way with his fiance, Allison.  Owen explains to Connor that he found a problem while working as a forensic accountant. Now, someone murdered his friend in the arson, and Owen knows he is next.  Owen writes a note and gives it to Connor. On their drive to Ethan's, Patrick and Jack start shooting at Owen's car.  Patrick and Jack are the same hitmen that killed Owen's friend.  Owen's car careens into the woods, and he knows he has very little time to save Connor.  Owen tells Connor to take the note and hide in the woods. Connor leaves the car and Owen slams on the gas.  Seeing someone is alive, the hitmen take more shots at the vehicle, and Connor watches Owen die.  Believing their mission is complete, Patrick and Jack leave the scene.  Connor starts to run and runs into Hannah. She warns Connor that he is going the wrong way, and if he wants to live, he will go her way.  Connor decides to follow Hannah and give her his note.  With Owen's written word, Hannah knows Connor is in danger. Patrick and Jack listen in to the police radio calls.  And when they hear that police found only one body in the car, they know Connor is alive. So, the hitmen start a fire to preoccupy the police while they find Connor.  With the hitmen after them, Connor and Hannah will have to go into the fire to save themselves.<br/><br/>Based on Those Who Wish Me Dead by Michael Koryta, this movie provides action, but it's nothing new.  While Hannah and Connor are the main focal point of the story, it's Allison versus Patrick that will keep your eyes glued to the TV. While you fall in love with that action, you never feel a growing concern for Connor or Hannah in the woods surrounded by fire.  One endearing aspect of this film is that it shows another side of depression.  After losing people on the job, Hannah becomes a risk-taker. Allison's battle and Hannah's expression of depression are the watchable points of this film.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
