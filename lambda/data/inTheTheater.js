    "review":"Elly Conway reads excerpts from her beloved Argylle series at a book signing. She promises the fifth book in the series is almost complete. Elly returns home to her cat, Alfie, and types the last chapter in the book. She sends the book to her mother, Ruth, before bed.<br/><br/>Elly wakes up and video calls Ruth for Ruth's opinion. Ruth thinks the book is compelling but doesn't like the ending. After Agent Argylle escapes his nemesis, LaGrange, with the help of his tech expert, Kira, LaGrange kills Kira. LaGrange rides away on a motorcycle. Agent Wyatt halts LaGrange's getaway and holds her for Argylle. She exposes their boss, Ritter, as the mole in the Directive before sacrificing herself. There is a master file in London of all the double agents, and Argylle will fly there to get it. And that's how the book ends. Elly calls it a cliffhanger, but Ruth says it's a copout. She wants Elly to write another chapter about Argylle going to London for the list.<br/><br/>Elly makes a last-minute decision to take a train to her parents' home because she hates flying. She puts Alfie in a cat pack and tries to hide from onlookers. After a while, Aidan recognizes her and openly admires her work. Then, he warns the next fan will attack her. Aidan battles several spies on the train and overcomes them all. He gives Elly the signal as he opens the emergency door on the train and they parachute out. Elly passes out on the way down.<br/><br/>Elly wakes up in Aidan's safe house. The authentic Directive intercepted Elly's manuscript because some of her stories materialized. However, the Directive thinks Elly is the key to finding the master list the tech wizard hid inside a silver bullet flash drive. The actual Agent Argylle was on his way to retrieve it in London. However, the agent went missing. Aidan wants Elly to use her writing skills and write the next chapter to predict what happened to the agent and the master list. Can Elly write for her life like she does for her fans?<br/><br/>This movie's vigorous start has sexy dances, car chases, and battles. Then, it switches to Elly's quiet life. Viewers watch her dream up her character's situations, dialogue, and backstory. The film hits its comical stride when Aidan approaches Elly on the train. And the script provides several big twists to pique your interest. However, the final fight scene is ridiculous and borders on a sad rom-com. This scene distracts from the audience's suspense and gives you the urge to leave. However, the movie has one mid-credits scene to tie in with the director's other films.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After Professor Dr. Thelonious 'Monk' Ellison rages at another student, the school advisors think he should take some time off to focus on his upcoming book and spend time with his family. Monk hasn't sold a novel in years, and several publishers turned down his latest manuscript. Another publisher turned down Monk's work because it wasn't 'black enough.' Monk thinks that's ridiculous. Monk returns to Boston and attends a book festival, but the crowd is thin. Another author explains that everyone is at the session for Sinatra Golden. Monk quietly enters her session and becomes sickened by her book, 'We's Lives in Da Ghetto.' He thinks her book appeals to the lowest demographic and panders to stereotypes. Later, Monk visits his sister, OB GYN Dr. Lisa, at work, and she drives him to their mother's home. They enjoy a night out with Agnes.<br/><br/>Monk and Lisa meet for lunch, and she warns him that Agnes's health is declining. Monk asks if their brother, Plastic Surgeon Dr. Cliff, will help, but he is in dire straits emotionally and financially since his divorce. Then, the unimaginable happens. Now, Monk has to come up with the money to care for Agnes. So, he sits and writes a book called 'My Pafology' with all the racial stereotypes and sends it to Arthur under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh.<br/><br/>Monk gets a phone call from a gleeful Arthur in the morning. A publishing company offered Monk $750,000 for his book. Monk can't believe it and rejects the offer because the book goes against everything he believes. Arthur reminds Monk Agnes needs help. Monk staggers to yes. Monk thinks this deal is one-and-done. However, Leigh's rise could trigger Monk's downfall.<br/><br/>Based on Erasure by Percival Everett, this movie bravely acknowledges issues in literature while defending it. Companies love to shine a light on black voices but only tell the stories of violence and slavery. However, companies shouldn't ignore or overlook these stories either. This plot gives the viewer a glimpse into the writer's process and multiple endings. Also, this movie makes the most uncomfortable moments hilarious. Don't let preconceived notions stop you from seeing this film. It's for everyone. So, do you believe Monk is a sell-out, or does the ends justify the means?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"NASA astronauts Kira and Christian take the Soyuz Rocket to the International Space Station. She meets the other American astronaut, Gordon, and the three Russian cosmonauts, Nicholai, Alexey, and Weronika. They show Kira around the space station. For the grand finale, they take her to see the Earth from the space station for the first time, and they explain the overview effect.<br/><br/>Kira checks on her mice in the morning, and one is missing a limb. She takes a break and looks at the Earth. At first, Kira sees a fireball and assumes it's a volcano. She alerts the others as several more fireballs explode. Something happened below, and the communications system has failed. They examine the systems and discover the thrusters aren't working. Without them, the I.S.S. will fall into the Earth's orbit in 24 hours.<br/><br/>Gordon works on his laptop when he gets an incoming message from the U.S. government. Russia launched a nuclear attack on the U.S., and they want the astronauts to take command of the I.S.S. by any means necessary. While they watch a war from space, can they declare one on the I.S.S.?<br/><br/>This movie mixes action with mystery. They need to determine who is following orders and who desires peace. While viewers overhear the astronauts discussing plans and debating orders, you don't get that side of the cosmonauts' conversation. It allows you to solve the enigma and keeps you in the action. While some of the graphics were wonderful, others were obvious. This movie is made for a big screen with a decent script, but don't expect Interstellar, The Martian, or Knives Out.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Celie and her sister, Nettie, reminisce about their mother when Celie's water breaks. Celie gives birth to a baby boy and names him Adam. Then, her father, Alfonso, enters to give the baby to God. Celie begs for more time with him, but her father says no. It's his baby, and he can do what he pleases.<br/><br/>Nettie walks home from school, and Mister follows her on a horse while serenading her. She tells him to leave her alone. Mister follows Nettie home and asks Alfonso for her hand in marriage. Alfonso says no. However, Celie means nothing to him, but she can work. As the men barter, Nettie and Celie watch. Alfonso tells Celie to pack her bags because she will marry Mister.<br/><br/>Celie, on foot, follows Mister on horseback to his home. He introduces her to his kids and tells her to start cleaning. Celine prepares dinner, and Mister demands to know why she didn't bathe the kids. She suggests doing it in the morning, and he slaps her to the floor. Late at night, Celie lays in bed and sees a picture of Shug Avery. Mister admits that's the woman he should've married. As Mister climbs on Celie, Celie stares at Shug's picture and dreams about her.<br/><br/>A few days later, Celie hears a knock at the door. It's Nettie. Alfonso started touching her, so she ran away. Celie begs Mister to let Nettie stay. He says yes. Everything seems to be going well until Mister creeps into Nettie's room. She pleads with him to stop and fights him when Mister resists. He grabs his gun and drags her outside. He threatens to shoot Nettie if she ever returns. When Celie tries to leave, Mister pulls her back and refuses to let Celie go. Nettie promises to write Celie once a week to let Celie know she is alive. But the letters never come, and Celie falls deeper into a loveless marriage of abuse. What will it take for Celie to discover a way to love herself and triumph over her dire circumstances?<br/><br/>Based on The Color Purple: A New Musical, this movie doesn't change the story. It only adds music to the plot. Now, the writers shorten the beginning between Nettie and Celie talking about a man doing his business. Also, the writers removed most of the internal monologue. The movie passes the torch between the original Celie and the current. Also, the sets change from a practical set to a stage setting without taking the audience out of the moment. The vocal performances are second to none, with perfect comedic timing. Be ready to sing, dance, cry, and stand taller after seeing this gem come to life on the silver screen.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
