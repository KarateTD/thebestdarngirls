    "mtitle":"Free Guy",
    "review":"Guy works as a banker in Free City.  Every day, Guy wakes up, says hi to his goldfish, gets coffee, goes to work, gets robbed multiple times, and goes home.  The robbers are the sunglasses people. While Guy adores his life, he tells his best friend, Buddy, the bank security guard, that he is missing something: love. As Guy walks down the street with Buddy, he sees a woman humming a familiar song and becomes fixated on her.  Buddy reminds Guy that the woman is wearing sunglasses and sunglasses people don't talk to them. Guy decides to get a pair of sunglasses and talk to his dream woman.  During the next bank robbery, Guy gets up and asks the robber for his glasses.  When Guy tries to take them, he accidently shoots the robber, gets the glasses, and follows the woman.  She is Molotov Girl, a level 197, experienced player. Molotov Girl tells Guy to put on the glasses, and Guy sees a whole new world of experience points, money, and power-ups.  Molotov Girl tells Guy to rob or punch someone, and he will level up quickly.  But Guy doesn't want to hurt people. Guy's nice guy routine catches the world by storm because Guy is an Non-Player Character or NPC in the world's most popular game, Free City. But Guy doesn't know it.  Molotov Girl does, and in real life, she is Millie, a game designer.  In 2015, Millie and Walter, a.k.a. Keys, created a world with AI.  People can watch as the NPCs learn, grow, and develop lives.  While Keys works for Soonami and its owner Antwan, Millie sued them.  She believes Antwan stole their base code to create Free City.  She spends her time in the game trying to find the proof on an unseen level. At first, Millie needed Guy to prove her case, but now she will need Guy to save himself, Free City, and his friends before Antwan destroys the servers.<br/><br/>This movie speaks to anyone who felt like a background character in their lives. While this movie inspires, it highlights issues in the gaming world.  This mix of Jumanji: The Next Level, Ready Player One, and The Lego Movie has memorable moments, laughable dialogue, a love story, and lots of easter eggs.  In the end, you will learn that someone created Guy with a purpose, and he isn't any ordinary NPC.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Respect",
    "review":"In Detroit, 1952, Reverend Clarence wakes up his daughter, Aretha, to sing for his famous friends, including Duke, Ella, and Dinah.  She wows the famous crowd.  Since her parents' divorce, Aretha spends some days with her mom, Barbara, but resides with Clarence and her grandmother. A couple of years later, Aretha was a mother of two but refused to name the father.  She sings at marches for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but Aretha wants to do more for the movement. When Aretha announces that she wants to march, Clarence has a surprise for her.  He talked to record companies about Aretha, and a record company in New York wants to sign her.  Four albums later, Aretha doesn't have a hit record.  Dinah tells Aretha to stop being so proper and find her voice.  It will take new management, two husbands, and a drinking problem for Aretha to find her voice in a path she made, one song at a time.<br/><br/>Following the treacherous example set by Clarence, Aretha went from one controlling man to another. She admired leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Angela Davis, but Aretha didn't know how to stand up for herself.  In meetings, the record producers, tour managers, and her father made the decisions while Aretha sat quietly. She existed with unspeakable pain that followed her, and her family calls it her demon.  It will take a Times article, a heavenly spirit, and a choir director for Aretha to shake that demon and create the best album of her career.  Having an actress that can do Aretha's voice justice, was the best move by the director.  You didn't lose focus with bad dubbing or bad acting.  This story of triumph and its honest telling will inspire and move you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Suicide Squad",
    "review":"Amanda Waller needs to assemble a larger team for her new mission, Operation Starfish.  She gathers three members of the original Suicide Squad - Rick Flag, Harley Quinn, and Boomerang - and adds more firepower to the team.  She gets T.D.K, Savant, Black guard, Javelin, Mongal, and Weasel to join. While this team is a formidable opponent for any enemy, Waller created another without telling Flag.  This team consists of Nanaue, Bloodsport, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and Peacemaker.  These teams have to travel to Corto Maltese and infiltrate the Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory.  The Thinker is conducting experiments with alien technology to overthrow the American government.  After Team A fails, leaving Harley Quinn and Rick Flag prisoners, Team B will go on a bloody rampage to complete the mission.<br/><br/>O.M.G! James Gunn added the wit of Deadpool to the blood and guts of The Kingsman with Tarantino storytelling.  This movie not only holds up to its name, but it gives you the darkness you would expect from a D.C. comic.  While you are enjoying the often-uncomfortable humor, you see awe-inspiring juxtaposition in many fight scenes. The camera angles and framing give the viewer a different view of each fight scene. Seeing the first movie isn't necessary to enjoy this film. This movie is worth the theater price but not for kids nor tweens.  And stay past the end credits for a glimpse of survivors.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"As Dr. Lily Houghton's brother, MacGregor, presents her research to the association, Lily sees they will deny their request for access to the arrowhead.  So, she sneaks around the building in hopes of finding it.  With a bit of maneuvering and ingenuity, Lily finds the box containing the arrowhead and takes it.  But Prince Joachim sees her and, unbeknownst to Lily, puts her life in danger. When she gives him the box, he releases her to her death, but MacGregor saves her.  Luckily, Lily removed the arrowhead from the box with a sleight of hand. Lily and MacGregor head to Belize to start their search for the Tears of the Moon.  A healing tree whose petals can heal any illness and lift any curse.  Upon arriving in Belize, Lily looks for Nilo, a famed harbormaster, to get to the Tree of Life but finds Nilo's door locked.  She hears a commotion behind the door and assumes it's Nilo, but Lily is wrong.  It's Frank.  Earlier that day, Nilo took Frank's engine because Frank defaulted on a loan.  Frank broke into Nilo's office to steal the key and unlock the crate with his engine inside. Frank opens the door and lets Lily believe he is Nilo.  At first, Frank doesn't want to go because it's dangerous, but when he sees the arrowhead around Lily's neck, he gets on board with the plan. But Prince Joachim is after them, and he will raise the dead to get to the Tears of the Moon and aid his army in the Great War.<br/><br/>You must come to this movie on time because a lot happens in the first five minutes. This movie also provides a bit of history with conquistadors, Prince Joachim, and British War Effort packed into an enthralling adventure. While the leads have great chemistry, you must remember the CGI is more cartoonish, like Pirates of the Caribbean.  This film is enjoyable whether you choose to watch it at home or in the theaters, and there is no need to stay after the end credits, but you get some platinum dad jokes.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bill retrieves items from his mother-in-law, Sharon, for his daughter, Allison, and makes the long trip from Stillwater to Marseille. In the morning, he sees Allison in the visiting room of a prison.  Five years ago, a judge convicted Allison of killing her roommate and girlfriend, Lina.  With four more years left on her sentence, Allison has new information and gives a letter to Bill. Bill presents the letter to the lawyer, but she tells Bill that the letter means nothing. Bill goes back to the prison and lies to Allison. Allison is ecstatic, so Bill gets to work.  He asks his hotel neighbor, who pretended not to be an Anglophile, Virginie, to translate the letter for him.  She reads the letter, and it states that someone told a professor that a man named Akim admitted to killing Lina. Bill's hunt for Akim will cost him a daughter, a family, and his view on the world.<br/><br/>Everything you heard about this movie is true.  The actors give stellar performances, and they are a shoo-in for award season.  The plot, however, drags because it has a love story in the middle of a rescue mission.  But don't worry, the love story has a greater meaning to the plot, so hang in there.  Unlike most movies in this genre, Bill doesn't find high-ranking officials to help his case, and he doesn't get help from an American lawyer.  Bill learns French, gets a job, and becomes friends with locals to help his daughter. The story and its twist will stick with you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
