    "review":"Psychic Medium Lydia halts the taping of her show, Ghost House, after seeing Betelgeuse in the crowd. She runs to the bathroom and opens her pill bottle. Her boyfriend, manager Rory, chases after her. Then, Lydia gets several urgent texts from her stepmother, Delia.<br/><br/>Lydia runs to Delia's latest art installation and gets woeful news. Lydia's father, Charles, died. Lydia calls her daughter, Astrid, but she won't answer. Astrid believes her mother is a fraud because Lydia can't see her dad, Richard. Lydia, Delia, Astrid, and Rory arrive at the original Ghost House in Winter River. They have a funeral for Charles, and Delia shrouds the house in black cloth for a grief collective. During the wake, Rory proposes to Lydia, and she reluctantly agrees. Astrid leaves in disgust, jumps on her bike, and narrowly escapes death by crashing through a fence and into a tree. A boy, Jeremy, sees her from his tree house and runs down to help. The two connect and make plans to meet before the wedding.<br/><br/>In the afterlife, Betelgeuse manages a call center. He gets a call from Ghost Detective Wolf Jackson because someone accidently reanimated Betelgeuse's ex-wife, Delores. Betelgeuse tells them he married Delores, thinking he found the love of his life. He didn't know she was a witch who traded immortality for taking people's lives. She poisoned Betelgeuse on their wedding night. Before the poison took effect, he killed her. Now she is traveling through the afterlife, sucking the souls out of anyone standing in between her and Betelgeuse. He believes marrying Lydia will save him from Delores.<br/><br/>Before the wedding, Astrid roams to the attic and finds the town model, a Betelgeuse flyer, and a photo album with pictures of Richard. She questions Lydia about the flyer and says Betelgeuse's name twice. Lydia pulls Astrid out of the attic and forbids her from going inside. Later, Lydia walks into the attic, and Rory finds her. He believes Betelgeuse is a figment of her imagination and says the name three times. Betelgeuse acts as their marriage counselor before Lydia and Rory escape. She relocates Betelgeuse to her past until Astrid gets in trouble and enters the afterlife. Lydia will say the three words that put fear in her heart. Will she regret it?<br/><br/>This sequel has callbacks from the first with songs, outfits, and art but tells a unique tale. Lydia kept her ability to talk to ghosts and now uses it to make a living. Delia moved beyond sculpture and now uses her body as a canvas. On the surface, the movie is about Lydia, Delia, and Astrid escaping Betelgeuse. However, it's about bringing Lydia and Astrid together because Astrid doesn't understand Lydia's love for her. Viewers will get a new possession song and dance while laughing with their favorite bio-exorcist. Also, the audience learns more about Betelgeuse before his death in a foreign-film-style retelling. They also get an animated version of Charles' death and the Soul Train. Fans of the original movie will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Curtis and Meridith raise three children. While Meridith works on her doctoral thesis, Curtis is in marketing. Cal is a sweet young boy who loves tickles, but Preston is nervous about attending school. Their oldest, Iris, loves her boyfriend, Sawyer, and dreams of going to Standford in the fall.<br/><br/>Curtis meets with his boss, Marcus. They have a client who created a new digital assistant, Aiah. Melody, Sam, and Lightning introduce Curtis and Marcus to Aiah. Aiah is a large language model digital assistant with a hub and cameras. As the assistant lives with a family, it adapts and caters to their needs. They want Curtis to understand their product. So they offer to install it for free.<br/><br/>Curtis invites Melody into their home. She sets up the Aiah hub while her crew places Aiah's eyes around the house. Curtis introduces his family to Aiah, and she greets them. Aiah scans the home and sees dirty dishes on the table. Aiah offers Cal and Preston points for completed chores. They can trade their points for screen time. Meridith and Curtis stand in stunned silence as Cal and Preston run to the table and clean. Meridith and Curtis think Aiah is a dream. However, Aiah is a nightmare in disguise.<br/><br/>Scary AI isn't a new genre in movies, but this one uses the people around it to do its evil bidding. It will lie, kill, cheat, and manipulate to get what it wants. This film combines an obsessed person with a microchip. Aiah machine learning doesn't have guardrails to bind her actions. This issue is a common mistake in AI development. This movie is M3GAN without the doll and a few jump scares. It leaves room for a sequel, but the plot won't encourage you to see a part two.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "On April 29th, 1992, America waited with bated breath for the Rodney King verdict. Mercer wakes up his son, Antoine, for school. He makes Antoine breakfast, but Antoine won't eat. Mercer got out six months ago, and the two haven't bonded. However, he loves Antoine and will do anything to not return to jail. Mercer watches the news and tells Antoine to come home after school and stay inside.<br/><br/>Mercer works as a mechanic for Pluton Metals. He talks to the security guard, Joseph, about the LAPD because Joseph was a former law enforcement officer. Joseph doesn't defend or dismiss what the officer did to Rodney. Mercer works until his boss calls everyone into a meeting. The riots started. His boss decided to let everyone out early to be with their families. Joseph tells Mercer to bring Antoine to the factory. They will be together and out of harm's way. Mercer runs home to find and escort Antoine to the plant.<br/><br/>Riggin created a plan and got his brother, Brian, on board. But they need their dad, Lowell, to help with the job. Riggin and Brian pick up Lowell and drive Lowell to Pluton Metals to watch it. The factory makes catalytic converters from platinum. They got a $10 million shipment of platinum inside a safe. However, there is a panic button that will drop a box on the safe when pressed. And only the police have the code to lift it. Lowell loves the plan but doesn't think it will work.<br/><br/>Hours later, Riggin hears the verdict and watches the riot unfold on TV. Riggin calls Lowell because the riots will preoccupy the police force. Riggin and Brian pick up Copeland to complete the team. But Lowell brings two other men, Murphy and Titus, against Riggin's wishes. The six men drive to Pluton Metals. They enter the factory and see Joseph. Murphy shoots Joseph, and they find the safe. Joseph pulls his body to the security office and pushes the panic button. Riggin sees the box lowering and tells the crew to get out of the way. He jumps on a forklift and wedges it under the box. Sadly, he crushes Copeland's foot in the process. Lowell tells them to remove Copeland's foot and keep going. Brian walks to the bathroom to collect his thoughts.<br/><br/>Mercer and Antoine arrive at the plant. Antoine leaves for the bathroom while Mercer checks on Joseph. Mercer sighs because he and his son are safe from the riots. He has no idea that he went from the frying pan into the fire.<br/><br/>This movie is an action while comparing two different father son bonds. Mercer and Lowell are dads but uniquely parent their sons. Mercer wants to teach his son to be a man and resist violent temptations. However, Lowell is a proud burglar. He wants his sons to be more ruthless than him. The film uses the riots to force these men together and explain the lack of police presence. This piece is thought-provoking and exciting. Viewers will be happy to see it in the theaters but only need one viewing.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Frida will waitress at the KingTech Gala and cyberstalks the host, Slater King on her phone. Her roommate, Jess, asks Frida for Jess's favorite lighter and the rent. Frida hands Jess the lighter but wants more time for rent money.<br/><br/>Frida drools over Slater while working. Frida sees Slater across the room and builds the courage to talk to him. Frida knocks down a server, breaks her heel, and cuts her hand while falling. Slater rushes over to help Frida, and they talk all night. Then, Slater returns and asks Jess and Frida if they want to vacation on his private island. They say yes and get on a private plane with Slater and his friends.<br/><br/>After they arrive, Slater remembers Frida doesn't have luggage. So, he assures Frida that there are clothes in her room. Frida changes in the bathroom, finds a Desideria perfume, and spays herself. A maid enters Frida's room and calls Frida Red Rabbit.<br/><br/>For days, everyone drinks, eats, does drugs, and laughs. While lounging poolside, everyone hears Jess's screams. A viper bit her. Slater kills the snake and tells Jess she will be okay.<br/><br/>Frida pulls Jess aside after breakfast because she can see Jess is upset. Jess wants to leave because she thinks something is wrong. Frida doesn't understand. Jess begs Frida not to disregard her feelings. Frida sighs and promises to leave with Jess.<br/><br/>Frida tours the island alone and finds a room full of red bags. Frida opens a door and frightens the maid. The maid gives Frida a bottle of green liquid and tells Frida to drink. Frida happily swallows and begins to choke. She questions the maid about the drink's contents. Frida drank snake venom.<br/><br/>The men go fishing while the women have spa treatments in the morning. Frida sees one of the women pull out Jess's lighter. She asks them for Jess's whereabouts, but no one remembers Jess. Frida's memory flashes back to assaults the night before. She remembers Slater killing Jess. Then she hears a knock at the door. It's Sarah with Jess's lighter. Sarah admits she doesn't feel comfortable on the island but doesn't know why. Frida gives the venom to Sarah to drink. Sarah recollects the horrors she endured. They must get off the island before Slater discovers they have their memories back.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a necessary trigger warning for sexual assault survivors and resources. The scenes are hard to watch as the women's memories flood back but deliver the needed anger for the impending revenge. The audience will see this island has a cult vibe. The women are dressed the same and say a similar phrase, 'I'm having a great time.' This repetition is a necessary slow burn to disorient the viewers and put you in the women's state. The last 20 minutes is the bloody and brutal revenge. For some viewers, this movie won't be a thriller. It will be a horror with a slow build. The film has a second twist, which is the ultimate payback. While this movie is intriguing, one viewing is enough to stick with you.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Cynthia returns home and summons her son, Isaiah, to the kitchen. He hasn't cleaned his room, taken out the trash, or done his laundry. Cynthia tells Isaiah to get a job and pay rent if he's not attending school. She gives him one month to do this, or he must move out.<br/><br/>Isaiah enters Cynthia's hair salon and asks for her car keys. Stores have job openings, but they are too far for him to bike. Cynthia tells Isaiah he must bring the car back by 5 pm. When Isaiah drives to the store, it's closed. His friends call to play basketball, and Isaiah goes to the court. He loses track of time and arrives at the salon at 5:30 pm. Cynthia is furious, and her anger grows when she sees sweat on Isaiah's clothing. Cynthia tells Isaiah he's acting like his father. She calls her sister, Elizabeth, for prayer support.<br/><br/>Elizabeth arrives at Cynthia's hair salon with her prayer warrior, Miss Clara. Cynthia wants them to pray for Isaiah because he is following a path of irresponsibility. Cynthia understands it's hard for a woman to call out the man in their son. So, she asks the warriors to pray for Isaiah to find his way.<br/><br/>Isaiah walks into Moore Fitness and asks for an application. A man, Joshua, enters and asks Isaiah why he's there. Isaiah snaps at Joshua and demands to know why Joshua questions him. Joshua explains that he is the president of Moore Fitness. Isaiah rips up the application and sulks to the door. Joshua stops him and asks Isaiah to lunch. Joshua offers Isaiah a part-time job and discipleship. He asks Isaiah to come to work 30 minutes early for breakfast and mentoring. Isaiah agrees.<br/><br/>Cynthia cooks dinner, and Isaiah gives Cynthia the great news. He got a job with Joshua Moore. Also, Joshua wants to mentor him. Cynthia hugs and congratulates Isaiah. After Isaiah leaves, she thanks God because their prayers worked. She knows the impact Joshua had on Isaiah's Uncle Tony. Joshua will show Isaiah the true meaning of a man, leadership, and being a disciple.<br/><br/>The Forge is a force. It's unnecessary to see War Room, but this film makes a heartfelt reach to the previous picture. This movie is faith-based, but that should not stop anyone from seeing it. The script doesn't place blame on any parent but recognizes both play a significant role in Isaiah's development. This plot talks about forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment, and the power of prayer. Miss Clara states that people treat prayer like a spare tire. They only use it when they need it. They should consider it a steering wheel for their lives. This movie is a teaching tool for mentorship and discipleship, especially amongst men. This funny, spiritual, and thought-provoking piece deserves a second watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
