    "review":"Noah prepares for a job interview in 1994 but notices something is wrong with his little brother's hand. Noah runs to his job interview after the hospital refuses to treat Chris. Unfortunately, the interview is over. They got word from Noah's former commanding officer. Noah is a tech whiz and a soldier but not a team player.<br/><br/>Noah returns home with Chris feeling defeated. Noah needs to make money now to help his family, so he takes a shortcut and uses his technical expertise to boost cars. He finds a beautiful Porsche and uses a Jimmy to get inside. Noah turns on the radio and hears a voice yelling for Mirage to roll out. The vehicle puts itself in gear and starts a high-speed chase. After a wild ride through the streets of New York, the car morphs into Autobot Mirage. Mirage tells Noah to be cool because the others are coming and are not fond of humans.<br/><br/>Across town, Elena interns at a museum. Her boss, Jillian, brought in a statue that she claimed to be Egyptian. But Elena thinks it's much older. Elena sees Jillian's lab tech badge and uses it to gain unauthorized access to the examination equipment. As she scans the item, it breaks apart and reveals something inside. She doesn't see a stream of light emanating from it, but Optimus Prime does.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is in awe of the light. He knows it comes from the Transwarp Key. The key opens portals through time and space. Optimus can use it to send himself and the Autobots to their home world, Cybertron. He calls the Autobots - Bumblebee, Mirage, and Acree - to plan a way into the museum. The Autobots catch Noah trying to sneak out as they discuss ways to retrieve the key. Mirage gets an idea. They can have Noah get the key for them. Optimus isn't keen on the idea, but he knows Scourge can see the beacon too.<br/><br/>Scourge leads the Terrorcons and works for Unicron. Unicron fuels himself by eating planets. Unicron sent Scourge to find the key to become unstoppable. The last time Scourge saw the key was on the homeworld of the Maximals. Their leader, Apelinq, sacrificed himself so the Maximals, including Optimus Primal, could escape with their greatest technology: the Transwarp key. Optimus knows it's a matter of time before Scourge comes to Earth looking for it.<br/><br/>Noah enters the museum, and Elena confronts him. The Terrorcons shoot a hole in the museum as they argue over the artifact. After battling on the museum's front lawn, Scourge destroys Bumblebee's spark and leaves with the key. However, they only got half the key. She believes the other half of the key is in Peru. Elena, Noah, and the Autobots head to Peru, with Scourge not far behind. Who will win the battle of the key?<br/><br/>Inspired by Transformers, this movie takes place after Bumblebee but serves as a prequel to the Transformers movie series. The intro gives the audience a glimpse of the Maximals and their mission before coming to Earth. However, the plot assumes you know the story of the Transformers. While Mirage delivers comic relief, the storyline focuses on brotherly relationships. The animation is crisp and not offputting. Luckily, the writers didn't add an unnecessary romance. Be prepared for a surprise in the final scene that will push this franchise into the future. Also, there is one mid-credit scene. This film is as enjoyable as Bumblebee but doesn't drag like the other Transformers films. It is a rejuvenated addition to the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gwen quits another band and worries her father, Captain George, and Aunt May on Earth-65. During her school dance, a massive lizard tore through the party. Gwen jumped into costume and killed the mutant, but sadly learned the lizard was her mutated friend, Peter Parker. As she cried over her friend, George entered with his gun drawn. He assumes Spider-Woman killed Peter, and now he tracks Spider-Woman's every move.<br/><br/>George gets a call over the walkie-talkie that a monster broke into the Guggenheim Museum and leaves because he thinks Spider-Woman will be there. Gwen hears the call, puts on her costume, and follows them. She realizes the monster is the Vulture, but it's not of her world. Then, a portal opens, and Miguel O'Hara and Jessica Drew capture Vulture. She can tell they are from another universe and asks to join them. Jessica likes the idea, but Miguel says no. George escapes his webs and points a gun at Spider-Woman. Gwen reveals her identity to George, and he begins to read Gwen her rights. Gwen walks through the portal and leaves George behind.<br/><br/>Miles balances Spider-Man duties with his education on Earth-1610. His parents, Jeff and Rio, wait for Miles as they sit with his guidance counselor. In another part of Brooklyn, Miles faces a new villain called The Spot, a.k.a. Dr. Jonathan Ohnn. During the Alchemax explosion, portals engulfed Jonathan's body. Miles defeats him and leaves him on a rooftop for the authorities. Miles slides into his counselor's meeting and tells his parents he wants to attend Princeton. Miles Spider-sense tingles, and he abruptly leaves the meeting to recapture The Spot.<br/><br/>As Miles zones out to music, Gwen opens a portal and persuades Miles to leave the house. Miles follows Gwen through a portal to Earth-50101 when he discovers the truth. In that universe, Pavitr Prabhakah is Spider-Man in Mumbattan. Before battling The Spot in Pavitr's universe, they meet Hobie Brown, Spider-Punk. The Spot absorbs the powers of Pavitar's universe's Alchemax before the Spider-people can stop him. Miles gets a vision of Jeff dying during his next battle with The Spot. Then, the Spot disappears with Mumbattan glitching around them, and Miles risks his life to save a little girl and an Inspector from the collapsing universe. Gwen thinks it's time for Miles to enter the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>She loves having him there, but Miguel thinks it's a massive mistake because Miles caused the multiverse portals that allowed villains to escape their Earth. And to make matters worse, Miles stopped a Canon Event from happening when he saved the Inspector. Peter B. Parker joins them and explains that Canon Events are necessary for every Spider-Person to develop. Miles puts the pieces together and realizes they know Jeff will die. Miles wants to save Jeff, but the Spider-People stop him. They tell him that he can't save one person and sacrifice everyone else. Miles believes he can save Jeff and Earth-1610, but he must first break free of the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>This sequel is better than its predecessor and worth a visit to the theaters. Viewers get new versions of Spider-People with unique animation styles. Each new character, including the villains, has a rich backstory and superb wit. The writers added easter eggs from all 3 Spider-Man franchises. You will laugh with pure joy and excitement throughout this film. If the animation wasn't astounding enough, this film has more drama than a telenovela. There is one mid-credit scene. And the film ends on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sebastian is the only child of Sicilian immigrant Salvo. Salvo raised Sebastian with a set of principles about men and their families. Men should always work, save money, and give their children a better life. Salvo moved to the United States 50 years ago and opened a hair salon to fulfill his 'better life' promise.<br/><br/>Sebastian works as a hotel manager for Hilton Hotels. His girlfriend, Ellie, is an artist. Her father, Bill, owns and operates the Collins Hotels, and her mother, Tigger, is a politician. He wants to receive their blessing and find the right place to propose. Bill and Tigger call Ellie and invite her and Sebastian to their summer home for the 4th of July. But the 4th is Salvo's favorite holiday, and Sebastian doesn't want to leave Salvo alone. Sebastian tells Salvo about the trip and his intentions to get his grandmother's wedding ring. Salvo says no because he doesn't know Ellie's family. Sebastian convinces Salvo to come but begs Salvo to be nice. He doesn't want Salvo to be too loud, too judgemental, or too cheap, but Sebastian will learn that he is the person that must change.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Sebastian's life, this film offers an endearing and funny look into family pride. Sebastian tries to stifle his father in front of Ellie's family. Nevertheless, in private, Sebastian admits he feels the same way about Bill and Tigger that Salvo does. While both families have different parenting styles, they have successful and caring children. This movie emphasizes that children must respect their roots to grow. Viewers should give this film their matinee money.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Years ago, Bert went to school abroad and got entangled with the Russian mob. He helped them rob a train and used the story in his standup material. Over the years, his story went viral, and Bert became a celebrity. During his rise, Bert fell into a life of alcohol and drugs but took a break after the police almost arrested his daughter, Sasha.<br/><br/>Bert grills during Sasha's Sweet 16 party, while Bert's father, Albert, overly criticizes Bert's culinary skills. Bert goes to the garage with his father to argue, and a woman, Irina, enters with a gun. She wants to know the location of her father's watch. Bert doesn't remember her father or the timepiece. He stole her father's family watch during the Russian train heist and changed the course of her family. At first, Bert and Albert laugh Irina's request. Then, she puts a gun up to Bert's head and threatens Sasha's life. Bert decides to go with Irina and find the missing watch. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This movie starts funny as Bert relives his story and adds new tidbits for fans. Then, it gets wild as Bert falls deeper into this criminal enterprise. Afterward, the film is flat and won't maintain your attention. When the script depends on the writer's imagination, the comedic fight scenes, drunken debauchery, and ramped drug use can't distract you from the substandard plotline. If you love a wild party movie, see this one matinee. Otherwise, wait for Prime Video.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Prince Eric sails the seven seas with his men. He wants to discover uncharted waters and find undiscovered land. Eric's advisor, Sir Grimsby, cautions Eric about carelessly putting his life on the line at sea. There are tales of the Sea King who will kill land dwellers as his daughters lore them with song. Eric is grateful that Queen Selina and the King adopted him, but he always feels out of place behind the castle walls.<br/><br/>Princess Ariel explores a shipwreck for human artifacts with her friend, Flounder. After escaping a ferocious shark, Ariel runs into her friend, Sebastian. Sebastian tells Ariel she is late for her father's meeting with her six sisters. Ariel rushes to her father, King Triton, knowing he will be upset. The king excuses her sisters and reminds Ariel not to go near savage humans. Ariel regretfully accepts the king's conditions and retreats to her hidden cave of treasures from the surface world.<br/><br/>The sailors shoot fireworks for Eric's birthday, and the lights in the sky draw Ariel to the surface. Then, a wave hits the ship and takes it down. Eric saves his men and dog but gets thrown off the other side of the boat. Ariel finds Eric and pulls him to safety. Before Eric's vision clears, Ariel swims away because Eric's people started running to him.<br/><br/>When Sebastian tells King Triton, the king goes to Ariel's cave and destroys all her trinkets. She tells her to never go to the surface again. Then, Ariel hears a voice in the distance. It's her Aunt Ursula. Ursula sees Ariel cares for Eric, but Ariel must become human to be with him. In return, Ariel will get legs. If Ariel receives true love's kiss in three days, she will remain a human forever. Otherwise, Ariel will be under Ursula's control for eternity. Ariel gets legs and swims to the surface before she drowns.<br/><br/>The people of Eric's kingdom take the mute and clumsy woman back to the castle. He sees Ariel and offers her a place to stay for as long as she wants. He doesn't recognize her and is too preoccupied with finding the woman who saved him. Ursula put a hidden clause in the agreement. Ariel would forget the kiss clause the moment she reached the surface. Now, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle must get Eric and Ariel to kiss in 3 days, or Ariel will become Ursula's minion forever.<br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of the classic Little Mermaid while making necessary changes. While Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder look more realistic, other animals have a 'Finding Nemo' feel. The musical performance has the source material's emotions, vigor, and theatrics. And the new songs blend in seamlessly with the plot. The updated storyline makes Ariel and Eric the same. They are two people looking for more in the world. However, their overprotective parents keep them behind walls because of preconceived notions about others. Don't miss Jodi Benson passing the dinglehopper to Halle Bailey. The only downside to this movie is that it is too long for children. Otherwise, this is a delightful and highly-entertaining film for the entire family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
