    "review":"Raymond comes home and gets a bottle of liquor when he hears ice rattling behind him.  It's private investigator Fletcher.  Fletcher was hired to find dirt on Raymond's boss, Mickey, for 150,000 pounds.  Fletcher has found a score of information and turned it into a script.  If Raymond pays in 20 million pounds, he can have the script.  Raymond is annoyed by Fletcher but offers to hear him out.  Fletcher starts with his boss Big Dave.  Big Dave hired Fletcher to get dirt on Mickey because Mickey snubbed him at a party in front of some very influential people. Mickey is ready to give up the marijuana business and retire from the mobster lifestyle.  He has decided to sell his operation to Matthew for 400 million. When word gets out that Mickey is going to retire, Dry Eye comes to Mickey to strike a deal.  Mickey thinks Dry Eyes' offer is disrespectful and unapproved by his boss Lord George.  Then, Mickey gets bad news.  One of his stash houses has been robbed and the video is streaming online as a rap video. Mickey knows the underworld sees his retirement as a weakness and everyone is gunning for him, his wife, and his business.  And that's just half of Fletcher's story.<br/><br/>In true Guy Ritchie storytelling, it's not over until it's over.  You have to be at this movie on time or you will miss crucial parts of the setup.  Of course, you can't trust what you see because Fletcher is telling a story for the 1st half of the movie.  The second half is told in real-time and has everyone one-upping each other.  This movie will become an instant cult classic while leaving an ending for part two.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"On September 9, 1999, Scott is stuck in DC traffic. He gets a call that his boss is retiring, leaving his job as a Pentagon staffer up in the air. He leaves his wife, Tara, in traffic and jumps on the metro. Scott sits and reads is daily packet and meets with is 11 o'clock appointment. It's Vietnam Air Force Vet Thomas Tully. Decades ago, Tully applied for William Hope Pitsenbarger to receive the Medal of Honor. After an investigation, it was downgraded to an Air Force Cross. Tully believes this is wrong. Staff Sargent Pitsenbarger was an Air Force Pararescuemen who was on a mission to airlift injured army men out of the battlefield in Vietnam in mission Abilene. When the first man is pulled up, Pitsenbarger realizes it's the Army medic. Pitsenbarger knows the men on the ground will need help to get the others to safety. When the last helicopter was about to fly off, they told Pitsenbarger to get back on the plane. He sent up one more man, told them to leave him, got a gun, and prepared for battle. He lost his life for men he never met. To get the Medal of Honor, Scott knows you need 3 things. Pitsenbarger is only missing the approval from the chain of command. Scott starts his investigation and sees the toll the war has taken on these men but he sees their courage in trying to honor their fallen comrade. When Scott's job is at risk because of political football, can he overcome his fear to get Pitsenbarger his medal before his father, Frank Pitsenbarger, dies of cancer?<br/><br/>n a time veterans are fighting for decent healthcare, this movie will make you want to stand up for them. The physical and emotional scars are presented to the viewer for shock and compassion. Each man has worked tirelessly for decades to obtain the Medal of Honor while coping with loss, regret, pain, and PTSD. Their constant disappointment in this country is reflected the moment they see Scott. They believe he is another puppet sent to sweep Pitsenbarger's valor under the rug. When he shows his true dedication to the project, it allows him to open his heart and fight it through to the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dolittle",
    "review":"John Dolittle gained a following as the man who could talk to animals. His following grew so large, the Queen of England asked him to help her. She rewarded him with a manor to care for all animals. And the manor would be his for life. While working on the animals, he meets Lily. They fell in love and worked at the manor helping animals far and wide. One day, Lily went on a mission to find an exotic tree with a berry that could heal any ailment. On her mission, her boat was destroyed and she died. John retreated behind the walls of Dolittle Manor with a handful of animals and refused to come out again. Years later, Tommy Stubbins is forced to go hunting with his uncle and cousin. In an attempt to miss a duck, Thomas shoots a squirrel. He brings the squirrel to Dolittle Mannor for John to treat. Lady Rose and Thomas are greeted by Chee-Chee the gorilla. Overcoming his distrust of people, John’s instincts take over to save the squirrel. In amazement, Lady Rose explains her presence at Dolittle Manor. The Queen of England has fallen ill, she wants John to come and help her. If she dies, he will lose the manor. John laughs and reminds Lady Rose that he owns the manor for life. Lady Rose corrects his misunderstanding. He owns the manor for Queen Victoria’s life, not his. John’s dog examines the Queen and smells something strange on her breath. With John’s help, the dog identifies the smell as Nightlock, a poisonous flower that kills days after consumption. John has to recover the berry, his wife died trying to find, to save the Queen’s life and his manor.<br/><br/>This movie is more related to the book than the other Dr. Dolittle movies. In a great shot, you go through the looking glass and see John speaking to the animals in gorilla, macaw, octopus, and dog speak as Lady Rose and Thomas look on during the squirrel’s surgery. The viewer understands Dolittle isn’t speaking English and the animals magically understand him. He is speaking their language and it’s being translated on screen. The jokes are cute but they aren’t memorable. For the parents, the movie is safe for kids and not too scary. Also, there are no songs. Stay pass the first end crawl but not to the very end. See this one in the standard format.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Just Mercy",
    "review":"In 1987, Walter McMillian, Johnny D to his family, cleared trees and looked up to the evening sky. He had no idea it would be the last day he would look at the sky as a free man. He was arrested for the brutal murder of Ronda Morrison. After the jury sentenced Johnny D to life, the judge overrode their sentence and gave Johnny D the death penalty. In Jackson, Georgia, Bryan Stevenson is an intern meeting with death row inmates to update them about their case. After he graduates Harvard 2 years later, Bryan moves to Alabama, he gets federal funding to start the Equal Justice Initiative or E.J.I., and he hires Eva as his Director of Operations. After meeting 5 other clients, Bryan meets Johnny D. He offers to help Johnny D but Johnny D doesn’t want to hear it. Bryan refuses to quit and meets with Johnny D’s family. They all admit attending a church fish fry with Johnny D the day of the murder. After hearing Bryan met with his family, Johnny D agrees to let Bryan be his lawyer.<br/><br/>Based on Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption by Bryan Stevenson, this story is moving, painful, and honest. It speaks on the unfair scales of justice based on race, class, economics, and political standing. You will be moved to tears when Bryan’s efforts fall short for some. At first glance, you will become angry at Ralph Myers. But as the film progress, you will learn the true nature of why he has done what he has done. You will sympathize with his agonizing decision. When you watch, remind yourself: This didn’t happen during slavery or Jim Crow laws. This happened in the late 1980s, less than 40 years ago. If you are inspired, donate to the E.J.I..<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Underwater",
    "review":"TIAN industries are drilling 7 miles to the bottom of the Mariana Trench for resources.  Nora, a mechanical engineer, brushes her teeth as the Kepler - their underwater station - around her starts to break apart.  The drilling has caused a huge earthquake causing the rig to rip apart.  She runs for safety when she catches up to Rodrigo.  They close up their hatch to prevent further damage, leaving many to perish.  As they crawl through the Kepler to find the escape pods, they find Paul in the rubble alive.  They find Captain Lucien alone and all the escape pods are gone.  Lucien, Nora, Paul, and Rodrigo make it to the control base to find Emily and Liam, biologist and engineer respectively.  After they can’t make contact with the surface, Lucien comes up with a plan.  They will put on pressurized suits, descend to the ocean floor, walk one mile to the Roebuck station, and board the escape pods.  Nora points out that the suit wasn’t designed to handle that amount of pressure.  They could die of insufficient oxygen or damaged suits.  Lucien points out that staying will ensure their death.  Leaving will give them a chance to survive.  They walk out not knowing the horror in front of them.  When TIAN drilled, they let something out.<br/><br/>With limited and predictable jump scares, this movie could have been made with real sea predators and had the same impact.  If you choose to see this movie in the theaters, you need to see it from the beginning.  The story of TIAN industries and what they are doing is covered in newspaper clippings.  During the film and in the end, you see hints for a possible prequel and sequel.  See this movie when it comes to Vudu.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",
