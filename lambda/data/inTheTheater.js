    "mtitle":"Alita: Battle Angel",
    "review":"After Dr. Ido finds her intact, functional brain in a scrap yard, Alita must battle to recover her memory and her drive for the future.  This movie surpasses Avatar visually while having the drama of a teen film and the action of NASCAR.  It ends on a cliff-hanger and should be seen in Dolby.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars",

    "mtitle":"Cold Pursuit",
    "review":"After receiving Kehoe's Citizen of the Year award, Nels Coxman learns is son died of a drug overdose.  Nels goes to his work's garage to commit suicide when he finds his son's friend, Dante bleeding and crying in the corner.  Dante tells Nelson, his son was killed over drugs he stole.  Nelson demands the name of his son's killer.  A name that will set off a killing spree.  This movie is nothing new.  The double crossing, killing, and setups are predictable and pretty boring.  It's the women of Kehoe that will make you laugh.  See it matinee or wait for Redbox.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After a wild bachelorette party, Ali can hear men's thoughts.  At first, she considers getting rid of this ability.  Then, she decides to use it to enter the boys club at her sports management company.  What could go wrong?  While this movie does make fun of men, it doesn't demonize them.  It allows the viewer to see that Ali's biggest obstacle is herself.  This is a great date movie but not a family movie.  Also, you will leave wanting to know: Who voted against Ali?<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"In order to save her friend, Suzu, Gloria is put in between a rock and a hard place.  Gloria is threaten to work with drug lord Lino to get information about Suzu.  She unintentionally blows up a DEA safe house.  In an attempt to get help, she gets threaten by the DEA.  So, she is risking life or jail to find her friend.  This movie is 15 minutes of set up and the rest all action.  Once it gets going, it never stops.  And it has more twist and turns than a soap opera.  See it today and hope for a part 2.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
