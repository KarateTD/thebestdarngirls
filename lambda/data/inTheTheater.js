    "review": "Elwood lives with his grandmother, Hattie, after losing his mother. He is attentive in school and dreams of going to college. His teacher, Mr. Hill, doesn't teach American History from the textbooks. He encourages his students to be free-thinkers, question authority, and demand change in the Jim Crow South. Mr. Hill sees promise in Elwood and gives Elwood a pamphlet for a free college. Elwood decides to hitchhike to the school and apply. A man pulls over and offers Elwood a ride. Later, police pull the man over. They arrest the man and Elwood for stealing the car. The judge sends Elwood to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school for boys.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Elwood to uncover that the staff treats black and white students differently. He considers changing the dynamics until he meets Turner. Turner warns Elwood that there are four ways to leave Nickel Academy: do your time, age out, run away, or die. Elwood believes there's a 5th way: change it. Decades later, the state is investigating the academy. It triggers panic attacks in Elwood because the state needs witnesses. Can Elwood testify and come to terms with his past?<br/><br/>Based on the novel The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, the director intentionally shot the movie from different perspectives. It gives Elwood's point of view from his childhood through his teens. The point of view switches when Elwood meets Turner. Once Elwood enters adulthood, the camera changes to a birds-eye view. This director does this to shock the audience during the final reveal. This film features abuse, but you don't see it. You feel it. This film is an extraordinary watch if you can handle it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Donnie and his crew ambush the security at the Antwerp International Airport tarmac. They break into one of the shipping containers and steal the diamonds inside. Some days later, they meet in Nice France, and Jovanna hands Donnie his cover story. He will act as a diamond dealer and use the stolen gems to get access to the World Diamond Center. Donnie funds the operation and collects information about the diamond volt. No one has ever successfully robbed the WDC, and Donnie plans to be the first.<br/><br/>Detective Nick finalized his divorce and custody agreement with his ex-wife in Los Angeles. And he can't get the representatives of the Federal Reserve to admit someone robbed them. Nick grabs Merrimen's girlfriend and threatens her life if she doesn't tell him where Donnie hid the money. She admits the money is in Panama. Only one account catches his eye, and someone has made regular withdrawals from France. Nick flies to France and uses his old U.S. Marshall's badge to gain access to the French police department. The police show Nick footage around the WDC, and Nick spots Donnie on security tapes. However, he tells the police it's not Donnie and leaves the precinct.<br/><br/>Donnie returns to his French apartment after spending time at the WDC. He hears something moving throughout and grabs his gun. Nick is eating a meal and enjoying a drink. He wants to join Donnie's crew and get paid. If Donnie doesn't include Nick, then Nick will arrest Donnie. So Donnie relents. Donnie and Nick think they can rob the WDC and leave without a trace. However, Donnie doesn't know that the diamonds he originally stole belong to a mafia syndicate called Octopus. The leader put a tracker on his diamonds and wants them back now. Can Donnie and Nick complete the heist before the Octopus gets a hold of them?<br/><br/>This sequel, inspired by the Antwerp Diamond Heist, has all the heart-pounding action of the first movie while telling a fresh story. It puts the audience in the middle of the heist with several ticking clocks, low-tech solutions, and high-tech gadgets. And the heist isn't the end of the story. The script recaps the first film, so you don't need to see it to enjoy this picture. There are no mid- or post-credit scenes, but the ending hints at part 3. So be ready to hold your breath and root for the bad guy because this film will take you on a wild ride.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Jason Crutchfield trains young men to box at the Berston Field House. Every day, a young girl, Claressa Shields, runs to the gym. One day, Jason notices Claressa throwing punches with the boys. He allows her into the ring to battle one round against Zay. Zay pins Claressa against the ropes and lands several punches, but Jason can see she has a fighter's spirit. He gives her a few pointers, and Claressa dominates in the second round.<br/><br/>Five years later, Claressa is on the Olympic radar. She travels with Jason to Spokane Washington, for the 2012 Olympic Team Trials. Claressa keeps her undefeated record as she rockets to the top and earns a chance to compete at the Women's World Boxing Championship in Shanghai China. If she ranks in the top 8, Claressa will join the U.S. Olympic Boxing team. Claressa and her hometown, Flint, beam with pride until Jason gives her some unfortunate news. He isn't a member of the AIBA, so he can't come to China to coach her. For the first time, Claressa won't have Jason in her corner for the most monumental qualifier in her career. However, this won't be her most grueling battle. She fights against poverty, abuse, and disrespect within her sport. Claressa steps inside the ring for herself but fights three rounds to change boxing forever.<br/><br/>People often equate a gold medal with fame and riches. But with every gold medalist you know, there are 10 you don't. Claressa learns she can't have the same demeanor as the men in her profession. She has issues at home, also. Her mother often neglects Claressa and her siblings, and her father spent most of Claressa's life in prison. When she returns home with a medal and below the poverty line, Claressa demands the respect she has earned. It's her unselfish nature and grit that shines through in this film. Unlike others, her story ends in triumph. You will leave the theater with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Romy makes passionate love to her husband, Jacob, and leaves the room to use her phone after saying 'I love you.' However, it's a ruse. She sneaks away to another room to watch submission adult videos on her computer while pleasuring herself. Romy practices her speech in the morning and makes encouraging notes for her kids before going to work as the CEO of Tensile Corporation.<br/><br/>Romy sees a dog attacking a man on her way to work. The dog lets the man go and charges for her, but another man stops the dog. Romy's assistant, Esme, tells Romy that a new crop of interns is starting today. Romy talks to them and notices the young man, Samuel, who saved her from the dog. She speaks to the interns and invites them to the company holiday party.<br/><br/>During the Christmas party, Romy escapes to the balcony and smokes a cigarette. Samuel follows her. He reveals that he picked her as his mentor. He scheduled a 10-minute meeting to ask questions about her and the company.<br/><br/>Romy enters the meeting and states that Samuel has 7 minutes. He corrects her and says he has 10. They verbally spar in the room before Samuel asks if she likes power. However, He believes she 'likes to be told what to do.' Samuel laughs off his admission, and Romy hussles to the door. However, he stops her and asks her to stay. She kisses him. Will Romy risk everything for her fantasies?<br/><br/>This film is a statement about the past and current beliefs about a dominant-submissive relationship. Romy has control over her business life but has issues from her past. Also, she harbors issues about her looks. On the surface, she has an idyllic marriage. However, she never expresses her unhappiness in the bedroom. So, Romy's relationship with Samuel is an illogical step, and their power dynamic sways back and forth, leaving you on the edge of your seat. However, only one person uses it to manipulate their way to the top. The neatly wrapped ending falls flat after all the games they play.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mufasa: The Lion King",
    "review": "Simba runs to find Nala and leaves their daughter, Kiara, with Rafiki, Timon, and Pumbaa. Kiara dreams she could be as strong as her grandfather. Rafiki explains that Mufasa wasn't always a king. Rafiki sits Kiara down and tells the story of her grandfather, Mufasa: The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mufasa and his parents, Afia and Masego, are living through drought. Mufasa's mother, Afia, tells Mufasa that the drought won't last forever. Until then, he should look at the horizon. Beyond the light is a land called Milele. Everything in Milele flows in abundance. Then, the rain falls. Mufasa and his family go to the watering hole with the other animals. Later, they hear a rumble and see a flood. An elephant hits the dam, and the water sweeps Mufasa away.<br/><br/>Mufasa struggles on a branch when a cub, Taka, appears. He is the son of King Obasi and Obasi's mate, Eshe. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him ashore. Eshe tells Taka to leave Mufasa alone because Obasi doesn't like strays. Eshe has compassion for the cub and brings Mufasa to the pride. Obasi wants to eat Mufasa, but Mufasa says he is too fast. Obasi creates Taka's first challenge to prove he can be a king. If Taka beats Mufasa in a race, Obasi will eat Mufasa. If Mufasa wins, then he can stay with their pride. They race, but Eshe sees that Taka lets Mufasa win. Obasi keeps his promise but tells Mufasa he must live with the females.<br/><br/>As Taka and Mufasa grow, their brotherly bond becomes tighter, much to Obasi's displeasure. Taka wants to learn how to hunt like Mufasa, but Obasi says his place is sleeping on a rock, protecting the pride. When Obasi falls asleep, Taka follows Eshe to learn. They hear others approaching but don't have time to escape. Mufasa saves Eshe while Taka runs away.<br/><br/>The remaining white lion returns to the leader, Kiros. With a lowered head, the surviving lion explains that Mufasa killed Kiros's son while saving Eshe. Then, he pledges vengeance for his son.<br/><br/>Mufasa can smell Kiros and his pride coming. Eshe tells Taka and Mufasa to leave and protect each other. Kiros believes there can only be one king. They slaughter Obasi's pride. However, Kiros knows the lion who killed his son isn't there. He orders his pride to track Mufasa and Taka. He vows to kill the pair, avenge his son, and become the king.<br/><br/>This Lion King prequel starts with a tribute to James Earl Jones. Then, it transports the audience to Pride Rock. It's not Mufasa's story alone. It's the tale of two brothers, entitlement, courage, and the king's court. By staying with the pride's females, Mufasa learned lessons that separated him from the others. Mufasa's journey mirrors Simba's. He leaves home for safety and finds friends along the way. The graphics far surpass the live adaptation of The Lion King, and the voice acting is stellar. The music flows wonderfully with the theme, although it drowns out the vocal performances. Also, the backing track makes the room vibrate and crescendos with the sun. This film is an astounding prequel.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
