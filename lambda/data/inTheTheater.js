    "review":"During the start of her summer-long community service, Nancy Drew over hears Flora alerting the Sheriff that her house is haunted.  The Sheriff ignores Flora but Nancy is intrigued.  Flora invites her to her home to solve the case.  Can Nancy keep it together when her loves ones are on the line?<br/><br/>Nancy Drew fans delight in this strong telling of the well-known novel.  Nancy is a strong lead character with a supporting cast worth its weight in gold.  Please be advised, some scenes maybe too intense for children under 7.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"June and her mother would create Wonder Park every day.  But when her mom has to leave in order to get better, June destroys Wonder Park and starts to obsess about her father's health.  June's father decides to send her to Math Camp but she escapes when she misinterpret a note from him.  In the woods, June discovers Wonder Park isn't imaginary.<br/><br/>This movie has so many emotions for a 85 minute film.  As you see, June's imagination come to life, you wish it were real.  This story is not about overcoming hurt but embracing it to become stronger.  However, if you are with a little one with a sick parent, this movie maybe too much to handle.  3D is not necessary.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Due to these bacterias, it is required for patients with CF to stay 6 feet apart.  Once Stella finds and loses loves, she decides to reclaim 1 foot.  When Will has to choose between killing Stella or letting her die, what will he choose?<br/><br/>Based on a novel, this movie will make you tear up.

    "review":"In 2020, aliens invaded and took out our power grid.  To get it back, we created an alliance.  We work for them and they won't kill us.  Anyone who disrupt the order is taken off planet.  Gabriel has created a plan to escape but he will go through hell to get there.<br/><br/>This movie mixes alien myth with Greek mythology.  The viewers will spend most of the movie wonder what is going on and who is in control.  You won't know until the last 20 minutes but the ride is worth it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Vers is excited to be granted her first mission by the Supreme Intelligence.  During the battle between the Kree and the Skrulls, Vers is capture and put into a mind hacking machine.  Skrulls uncover memories she thought were dreams.  She escapes the machine and jumps into an escape pod that veers off course to C-53, a.k.a. Earth.  On earth Vers will learn the truth about her powers, the Kree, and the Skrulls.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the MCU need to watch the other films before watching this movie.  Thare are a lot of jokes and references to the past and present that will not make sense without knowledge of these movies.  With so much history to cover before the initial story, the first 10 minutes feels extremely rushed.  If you miss it, you will miss everything.  And 90s babies, be ready for some nostalgia.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
