    "mtitle":"Honest Thief",
    "review":"Tom met Annie a year ago at a storage facility where she worked, and he wants to continue his future with her without looking over his shoulder every day.  The FBI knows Tom as the In-and-Out Bandit. Tom buys a house for him and Annie, then he goes to a motel and calls the FBI.  Agent Sam Baker picks up the phone and doesn't believe Tom's story. So, he gives the phone to his partner, Detective Meyers. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million.  He is willing to give it all back if they give him what he wants.  Tom wants to be held for a maximum of two years in a minimum-security prison with full visitation rights.  Meyers still doesn't believe him, so they hand the case to Agent Ramon Hall and Agent Jason Nivens. After meeting Tom, they believe Tom is another liar, so Tom tells them how he committed the crimes.  Tom gives them the location of $3 million.  They go to the storage unit expecting to find nothing.  However, they find the motherload.  John gets an idea.  They can take the money, kill Tom, and tell Baker and Meyers it was all a hoax. Ramon hangs his head and says yes. Ramon and John walk into the hotel room, and John is prepared to kill Tom, but there is a knock at the door.  It's Agent Baker.  Baker walks inside but can tell something is off, then John shoots him point-blank in the head. Tom jumps in Annie's car and drives away.  Tom has to come clean with the woman he loves, clear his name of murder, and peacefully turn himself in before John and Ramon kill him and Annie.<br/><br/>Yes, this is another Liam Neeson kills-everyone movie, but that's why it's fun.  Tom never claims to be perfect or a good guy.  However, he tells everyone he is honest. It's interesting to contrast what drives each pair to fight together.  Tom and Annie find strength through love and the future.  And for Myers, he fights to get justice for Baker and find the person who killed him.  For Ramon and John, their partnership stands on blackmail and money.  Seeing the pairs work together or for each other changes throughout the film, and it will be their downfall or salvation.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Kid Detective",
    "review":"As a child, Abe Applebaum had a nose for mysteries.  His principal came to Abe with his first case when Abe was 13.  It was the case of the missing fundraiser money.  Abe picks a suspect, and the principal recovered the money.  Soon, Abe was running a business out of his treehouse, and the police even called to consult him on bigger cases.  When someone chopped down his treehouse, the thankful town got him an office on Main Street.  The mayor's daughter, Grace, was his receptionist, and he paid her with soda.  His business was booming, and Abe was in the newspaper every week, but that all changed when Grace went missing.  The town and Abe expected Abe to find her, but when he couldn't, Abe's town and Abe fell into a depression.  Today, at 32, Abe is self-loathing, solves mediocre mysteries, and has more debt than cases. As he walks home from work, he sees police combing through the river. The police found Caroline's 15-year-old boyfriend stabbed to death in the river, and they have no leads. So, Caroline asks him to find who murdered her boyfriend.  He asks if she is sure because the truth can be shocking.  Caroline is sure and hires Abe.  This murder case will be his first adult case and a chance to clear Grace's case from his soul.<br/><br/>This movie goes from Encyclopedia Brown to 8mm in less than two hours.  It's a mix of Criminal Minds' unsubs with Psych's hijinks and wit.  You will laugh at the inappropriateness of Abe as he hides in a little girl's bedroom after spying on a teenage boy.  This story is perfection because Abe carries the weight of the town on his shoulders, and you can see the moment the weight lifts.  If you have ever gone through a hard time, you will connect with Abe's tears. When Abe finds the murderer, he will learn the truth about his town and himself.  This movie will become a cult classic.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The War with Grandpa",
    "review":"After several incidents, Sally leaves work early, drives to her father's, Ed, home, and asks him to live with her family. Sally and her husband, Arthur, have three children, Mia, Peter, and Jenny.  Sally and Arthur need to make room for Ed. Peter doesn't understand why he has to give up his room because Ed can stay in the attic.  Sally explains the stairs will be too much for Ed.  So, Peter will move, and that's final.  The next day, Peter's friends tell him he has rights, and he should fight for them. Peter's friends tell him to declare war to get his room back.  So, Peter writes a Declaration of War and slips it under Ed's door. It states Ed has 24 hours to vacate the room, or he will suffer the consequences. Twenty-four hours later, Peter makes the first strike.  After the second strike, Ed is ready for battle, but he calls Peter to make Rules of Engagement.  First, no collateral damage.  Second, no telling. Peter and Ed use tools, food, and their friends to fight the battle, but who will win the war.<br/><br/>Based on The War with Grandpa by Robert Kimmel Smith, this movie is full of hijinks and fun.  While the two go to war, they try to have peace talks along the way.  Whether it's with a neutral third party or on a boat, they do try to make peace.  However, Peter learns the cost of war and why war goes on for so long. The sweetest moment in this movie is during the war.  Ed discovers someone is bullying Peter, and during their war, Ed comes to his defense. This movie is clean fun for older kids and adults.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Yellow Rose",
    "review":"Rose begs her mom, Priscilla, to let her go to the Broken Spoke Bar in Austin with her friend, Elliot.  Priscilla, knowing her daughter will be 18 soon, agrees. They dance, sing, drink, and meet country singer Dale Watson.  As Elliot drives back, Rose falls asleep. Rose wakes up and sees ICE taking Priscilla away.  Priscilla yells to Rose to find the letter, while Elliot pulls Rose away and they drive off in his car.  Rose tells Elliot to pull over, then reveals her biggest secret.  She and her mom are illegal.  Her mother believed her father's status would trickle down to them.  But when he died, Priscilla learned that was not true. The next day, Elliot takes Rose back to the Inn.  She sneaks in to find the letter Priscilla told her about during her arrest. Inside the envelope is cash, a necklace, and instructions for Rose.  Priscilla instructed Rose to go to her aunt Gayle's home and use the paperwork to have Gayle take power of attorney, then start the citizenship paperwork.  However, Rose will learn that blood isn't enough to make a bond, but friendship and kindness can do anything.  Rose will use the music she creates to build those bonds.<br/><br/>Set to the pain and struggle of country music, Rose's life mirrors so many undocumented children living in the United States today.  The writers are careful not to get too political or place the blame on one person. Rose, like her song states, runs with no place to go.  She has no home, no family, and no country.  But she uses her pains, lessons, and friendships to sing the country music she loves.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
