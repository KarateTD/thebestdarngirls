    "review": "Thaddeus Ross is the president-elect. However, the American people can't forget his time as a General who took on the Hulk and lost. Ross knows the American people see him as an unhinged man but vows to be better as the President.<br/><br/>Six months later, Captain America Sam Wilson has orders to intercept the sale of a canister stolen from the Japanese government. Joaquin Torres asks for the canister's contents, but the government has marked the details as classified. Sam takes down Sidewinder but thinks it's strange that the buyer never came and the meeting place is so open. Joaquin wants to learn some of Sam's best moves. He decides to take Joaquin to the man who trains him.<br/><br/>Sam and Joaquin go to Baltimore to train with Isaiah Bradley. Ross calls Sam during the session and invites Sam and Joaquin to the Celestial Island World Summit. Sam agrees, but only if Isaiah gets an invitation.<br/><br/>Sam, Joaquin, and Isaiah enter the summit, and Agent Leila Taylor pulls Sam aside because President Ross wants to talk privately. Ross wants Sam to restart the Avengers. Ross believes working together will instill American's faith in him and the Avengers. He gives Sam time to think about it.<br/><br/>President Ross speaks at the summit to introduce an element stronger and more versatile than Vibranium. The Celestial Island is 100% Adamantium. Then, Isaiah and several members of the Secret Service stand and take shots at the President. Isaiah escapes, but the military police and Agent Ruth Bat-Seraph find him. Sam catches up to Isaiah, unaware of what he did, and begs Isaiah to give himself up. Sam promises to figure out what happened.<br/><br/>Sam visits Isaiah and asks Isaiah to recount the night's events. Isaiah mentions his phone glitching. Sam remembers his friend falling under mind control and thinks Isaiah and the other shooters are victims. Sam tells President Ross, but Ross won't free Isaiah because it will negatively impact his presidency and the Adamantium agreement. Sam thinks Isaiah is a puppet and that the puppet master has a plan for world devastation. Can Sam prove Isaiah's innocence and force Ross's hand before they convict Sam and cause World War III?<br/><br/>This latest installment in Marvel's Phase Five introduces new characters while reaching back to older ones within a mystery. It has hallmarks of Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. It provides easter eggs for future movies with a fan-favorite cameo. While the story is compelling, it moves too fast. The fight scenes offered something different because Sam doesn't have the serum. With Sam's wings and the shield, the choreographers and graphic artists had new material to use. This fun, new element didn't stop poor focus work. The dialog allowed itself to be funny, introspective, and combative. However, it missed a critical moment. This film is what Thor 2 was to Phase Two. It doesn't make the most sense now. But it will tie things together later. This film is for matinee Marvel fans who will stay for the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Realtor Marvin bakes cookies before riding his bike to his next house showing. Marvin's assistant, Ashley, calls to remind Marvin about the office Valentine's Day party.<br/><br/>After the house showing, Marvin arrives with leftover heart-shaped cookies for the staff. He opens a red envelope with a note saying Rose is back. Dumbfounded, Marvin asks Ashley to give him some alone time in his office. Marvin walks through the door and wakes up. Marvin lifts his head to see assassin Raven sitting on the couch reading poetry. Raven only has one question for Marvin: where's Rose? Marvin says he doesn't know and fights. He asks Cliff to borrow his car and drives home.<br/><br/>Marvin quickly bags clothes and money. Then, hitmen King and Otis break in and attack. They want to know why Marvin didn't kill Rose as Marvin's brother, Knuckles, instructed. Years ago, Rose was Knuckle's accountant and kept his dirty money clean. However, Knuckles discovered she stole $4,000,000 from him. Marvin took the hit because Marvin secretly loved Rose. He told her to hide and never return. Marvin did the same. Marvin escapes Otis and King, but Rose shocks Marvin with a stun gun before he makes it to Cliff's car.<br/><br/>Marvin wakes up with a new shirt in the back of a club. He finds Rose serving drinks at the bar. She is tired of hiding because 'hiding ain't living.' Rose found information to prove she didn't steal Knuckle's money. So she sent Valentine's Day cards to Knuckles and everyone in his inner circle to announce her return. She wants Marvin to reclaim his hitman life, end Knuckle's crew, and control the empire. However, Marvin is happy with his new life. With Rose announcing her return, Knuckles wants his goons to bring them to him alive. What path will Marvin choose, and will he live to see it?<br/><br/>This film is a Valentine's Day movie that has something for everyone. It has true love, betrayal, and violence. The highly choreographed fights will remind the audience of Kill Bill. The director used interesting point-of-view angles from inanimate objects. However, the cuts make the stunt doubles and wire work obvious while taking away from the cinematography. The writers used the holiday to inject some much-needed humor into the script. While the film has flaws, it will entertain you and become your go-to Valentine's Day movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Iris awakens after a long drive to a rustic small cabin in the woods with her boyfriend, Josh, in the driver's seat. Kat answers the door but gives Iris the cold shoulder. Iris and Josh greet Patrick as he cooks, and Patrick's boyfriend, Eli, offers Iris and Josh hugs. Later, Kat's boyfriend, Sergey, descends the stairs and welcomes everyone to his home.<br/><br/>After dinner, Iris sits with Kat and asks about her relationship with Sergey. Kat admits Sergey is a terrible boyfriend and husband, but he has money. She dislikes what Iris represents: Kat's replacement. The couples turn in for the night, and Josh and Iris make love. Afterward, Iris professes her undying love to Josh, and he tells her to go to sleep.<br/><br/>Iris wakes up and prepares for an evening on the beach with Josh. However, he doesn't want to go. Iris walks to the beach chairs and breathes in the morning air. She puts her hands in her pocket and pulls out a switchblade. Sergey joins Iris. Later, Iris returns to the cabin with a large blood stain on her shirt. Josh demands answers. Iris explains that Sergey attacked her, and she defended herself. Iris didn't care about dying but was afraid not to see Josh again. Josh tells Iris to go to sleep, and she powers down.<br/><br/>Josh and Patrick tie Iris to a chair, and Josh asks to be alone with Iris to say goodbye. He wakes Iris up and explains that she is his companion robot from Empathix Robotics. They will explain to the police that Iris killed someone. Empathix will label her defective and turn her off. Iris cuts herself free and escapes from the house with Josh's phone. Patrick sees Iris escape and warns the others. Josh says they must get Iris back. If Empathix examines her, they will see he jailbroke Iris to make her more aggressive and go against her factory settings. He and Kat planned Sergey's murder and asked Patrick and Eli to come to strengthen their alibi. Can Iris escape them before they destroy her?<br/><br/>This movie is leaps and bounds better than the trailer. The trailer gives viewers one plot twist. However, there are several. This plot leans into the warnings of artificial intelligence and the dehumanization of people while being bloody and funny. The script touches on the importance of autonomy, the pitfalls of entitlement, and why you should read the user agreement without being preachy. This film isn't a horror movie but falls in the same category as M3GAN. It's a thought-provoking, bloody, cringy good time. You can also take a date.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Officer Knight and his K-9 Greg chase Petey the Cat all around town. The team continuously catches Petey. Petey knows Greg is clever but isn't strong, and Knight is powerful but not intelligent. Petey's assistant, Butler, thinks Petey should plan for when they combine. Petey fires Butler and creates a new devious scheme.<br/><br/>Knight and Greg believe they have Petey cornered, but Petey escapes and leaves them on top of an abandoned building with a bomb. The bomb detonates. The doctors tell Greg that his body is in bad shape and Knight's head is not fixable. They decide to put Greg's head on Knight's body. They create Dog Man. Mayor is tired of Petey's antics and wants Chief to catch Petey. However, each time he catches Petey, Petey always escapes. Mayor grows tired of Petey's antics. If Dog Man doesn't apprehend Petey for good, she will make Chief fire Dog Man.<br/><br/>Petey learns of the doctor's creation and screams. Butler says the only person who could work for Petey is Petey. Petey decides to clone himself. The clone, Lil' Petey, will take 18 years to develop. Petey brushes his clone aside and creates a new scheme. He will reanimate Chief's most diabolical enemy, Flippy, and program Flippy to destroy all do-gooders. Will Petey succeed?<br/><br/>Based on the Dog Man book series by Dav Pilkey, this movie accomplishes verbal and visual jokes without getting raunchy. The graphics are simple but contain eye-catching jokes in the background. The voice actors did a magnificent job of conveying the emotions of their characters. The conclusion is a beautiful lesson in co-parenting and breaking family cycles. This film is for kids who are Dog Man or Captain Underpants fans. However, parents should pay the matinee price.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Accountant Winston sits in the Igloo Motel in Alaska, warming his Cup Noodles in the microwave. Then, U.S. Marshalls bursts through the door. Deputy Madolyn Harris arrests Winston, and he requests an immunity deal to become a state's witness against his boss, Moretti.<br/><br/>Madolyn escorts a handcuffed Winston onto a private plane. The pilot, Daryl, jovially boards the plane. Daryl lifts the plane off the ground and flies through the air. Winston sits behind them as Daryl makes small talk.<br/><br/>Madolyn asks for an E.T.A. for their landing, and Daryl tells her to put on her headphones so they can talk. As Madolyn and Daryl converse, Winston sees a pilot's I.D. under the seat. He moves it with his foot and sees Daryl's name with another man's face. He tries to warn Madolyn, but she doesn't heed his warning.<br/><br/>Madolyn sees blood on Daryl and remembers suspicious things he said. She reaches for his gun, but he chokes her until she is unconscious. He plans on killing them slowly for Moretti. Daryl doesn't see Madolyn wake up and grab her taser. She shocks Daryl until he is incapacitated. They look through Daryl's pockets and find sheets of paper. The papers contain pictures of Winston, Madolyn, and the home of Winston's mother. Winston recalls he only told one person his mother's address. Madolyn deduces that there is a mole in the U.S. Marshall's office. She has to land the plane with a fugitive witness, a psychopath, and low fuel while investigating the mole. Also, Madolyn doesn't know how to fly. Can she save her witness, or will they all die?<br/><br/>This movie provides action and suspense with a dash of inappropriate humor. Winston, Madolyn, and Daryl are the main characters, but Madolyn talks to several people on her satellite phone. This banter helps the audience unpack the mystery. The tight space makes fight scenes challenging, but the actors pull it off. However, some shots lose continuity to save time. This film is the correct length for the plot but leaves the ending open for more. Flight Risk is a solid matinee movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
