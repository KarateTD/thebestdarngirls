    "mtitle":"Napoleon",
    "review":"Napoleon stands guard as the people of France behead Queen Marie Antoinette. Revolutionary leader Paul Barras asks Napoleon what the troops need on the battlefield. Then, Napoleon alerts Paul that Toulon is a port city. If they take siege of the port, France will control the city. Next, Napoleon and his army executed Maximilien Robespierre and ended the Reign of Terror to restore order in France.<br/><br/>Napoleon enjoys his new title of General at a party and notices a woman, Joséphine, playing cards. She boldly approached him as he stammered. Later, Joséphine sends her son to retrieve his deceased father's weapon. He takes pity on the boy and returns the weapon to see Josephine standing atop the staircase. Soon, Napoleon takes Joséphine as his bride. With love conquered, Napoleon only has one more thing to conquer: the world.<br/><br/>The rise of Napoleon is as astounding as it is complex. He was brilliant on the battlefield but didn't have the social graces of a politician. This movie covers 23 years of Napoleon's rise and fall. The director, writer, costume designer, and set designer paid great attention to detail. The beheading and battles were unadulterated bloodbaths that left nothing to the imagination. However, the movie begins to lull after Joséphine's death. The big screen is the best way to see this movie, but it's better for history buffs.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Wish",
    "review":"Asha is a few months shy of her 18th birthday and gives tours of her homeland, Rosas. Rosas is famous. King Magnifico learned sorcery after wicked rulers destroyed his home. Then, he created Rosas and invited anyone to come. He uses his power to grant one wish every month in a ceremony. On a person's 18th birthday, the king asks for their wish. The person gives it to him and never remembers it. Today is the 100th birthday of Asha's grandfather, Sabino. Everyone thinks Magnifico will grant his wish in the ceremony.<br/><br/>Asha finishes another tour and runs to her friends for encouragement. She has an interview to be the king's apprentice. Queen Amaya enters the kitchen and asks Asha to speak to the king. He lets her enter the room of wishes. Asha looks at everyone's wishes in wonder and finds Sabino's. He wished to inspire people with music. Asha asks Magnifico if Magnifico will allow Sabino's wish, and Magnifico says no. He doesn't know if Sabino will motivate people to love Magnifico or overthrow him. Since Sabino's wish is too vague, he won't grant it. Asha tells Magnifico to return the wish if he won't allow it because remembering it will give Sabino hope. Magnifico refuses. He rejects Asha's application for the apprenticeship.<br/><br/>Asha tries to warn Sabino and her mother, Sakina, about Magnifico, but they don't want to hear it. Asha runs to her father's favorite spot and makes a wish upon a star. A bright light comes from the sky, and all of Rosas, including Magnifico, feels it. A star comes from the sky and gives Asha's goat, Valentino, the ability to talk. Asha decides to break into Magnifico's castle and free the wishes. Magnifico believes the unknown magic is a threat to his kingdom. And he will seek and destroy it no matter what.<br/><br/>The animation and songs are second to none in this film. King Magnifico is the classic Disney villain. Also, the film makes nods to Little Jon, Bambi, Thumper, and more beloved Disney characters. The trailer is tricky because it makes viewers think Asha wants Magnifico to grant their wishes. However, she wants Magnifico to return the wishes he won't allow to restore hope, imagination, and invention to the people. This film isn't saying to grant all wishes. It's saying wishes inspire hope, so you shouldn't forget them. That's the message for kids.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes",
    "review":"Coriolanus Snow dresses his best to hide his family's loss of wealth and prepare for the Plinth Prize. The scholarship will guarantee his place at Capital University and prosperity for his family. Snow's classmates think he is a shoo-in because Snow is at the top of the class, but Snow thinks Dean Casca Highbottom despises him. They decided to change the requirements for the prize. It will no longer go to the student with the best grade. However, the students will become mentors to contestants in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. The mentor with the winning contestant will win the prize. Snow curses when he gets the female from District 12.<br/><br/>For District 12, Lucy Gray Baird hears her name and walks to the podium in her finest dress. She stands up, straightens her dress, and sings a song of rebellion. The audience loves her.<br/><br/>Several of the students think the games are antiquated. The Head Gamemaster, Dr. Volumnia Gaul, asks them to write a paper to make the game more intriguing. She will implement the best paper in these Hunger Games. Snow waits for Lucy Gray to disembark the train and greets her with a flower. She tells Snow that gifts aren't enough. He has to believe in her. The car drops the contestants into the Capital Zoo so spectators can watch them before they die in the arena. Snow pledges to do the impossible, but Lucy Gray must play her part. She needs to captivate the audience. Snow will fall, settle, and rise.<br/><br/>Based on The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins, this film covers the rise of Coriolanus Snow. From humbled student to gamemaster, Snow was always cunning. The games didn't change him; they amplified his authentic nature. This film calls back Katniss, Mockingjays, Jabberjays, and The Hanging Tree song for Hunger Games fanatics. Viewers assume the end of the game concludes the story, but it's only the middle. The story has three parts: The Mentor, The Prize, and The Peacekeeper. This change causes the story to drag, but it's worth the matinee price on the big screen.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Trolls Band Together",
    "review":"Poppy creates Bridget's perfect wedding dress and beams as Bridget's maid of honor. As the pastor asks the crowd for objections, John Dory yells from the crowd. John Dory is Branch's older brother. Poppy stares in shock because she never knew Branch had a brother. John reveals Branch has four brothers: himself, Spruce, Clay, and Floyd. They made up the group BroZone. The group broke up after they failed to hit the Perfect Family Harmony. The four members left the baby, Branch, to care for their grandmother. John needs Branch's help because the pop duo Velvet and Veneer trapped Floyd inside a diamond perfume bottle. Anytime they need talent, they spray themselves with Floyd. However, each application brings Floyd closer to death. Branch recalls that the Perfect Family Harmony can break diamonds. John wants to get the band back together to sing the harmony and free Floyd before Velvet and Veneer kill him.<br/><br/>The third installment of the Trolls franchise has the catchy boy band mashup spanning five eras of music. Kids, parents, and grandparents will dance in their seats to tunes that define the boy band craze for them. Based on Good Luck Trolls dolls, this movie packs jokes for kids while slipping in innuendos for parents. With the catchy music and quick wit, something is missing from this Trolls movie. The other films brought raw emotion to the surface for the viewers and made a statement about music. This story fell flat on both aspects. This film brings back old favorites and delves deeper into Branch's story. However, it doesn't resonate like the other films.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Next Goal Wins",
    "review":"Soccer coach Thomas Rongen sits in front of the American Soccer Federation to explain himself and what he brings to the organization. If he coaches a team of their choosing, he can keep his job. He must coach American Samoa. They lost to Australia 31-0 in 2001. Since then, the team hasn't scored a goal and has been at the bottom of the ranks. Thomas begrudgingly agrees to coach them.<br/><br/>Thomas lands on the island, and a camera crew greets him. The cameraman is the team's president, Tavita. Tavita doesn't care if the team wins or loses under Thomas. He wants the team to score 1 goal in the qualifier in four weeks. Only one is a success for Tavita. Can Thomas turn the team around?<br/><br/>Based on the documentary Next Goal Wins, this movie is delightful in its storytelling. A priest introduces the team, the culture, and Thomas to the audience. Tavita had a heatstroke during the qualifying match. So, his son had to give him a play-by-play of the game. Also, Thomas is overcoming loss. He turned that pain into rage and lost his job. He learns from the culture to choose happiness. This film is a feel-good triumph that will make you cheer. However, one viewing is all you need.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
