    "review":"Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, hide among the Freman people in the desert as word of their death travels through the houses. Stilgar pulls Jessica aside because he and other southern Freman believe Paul is there to fulfill the prophecy. A Reverand Mother is dying, and they want Jessica to take her place. Jessica says yes and goes through the deadly ritual but doesn't tell them she's pregnant. With her new status, Jessica will convince non-believing Freman that Paul is the Messiah.<br/><br/>Paul desires to learn the ways of the Freman. Stilgar gladly teaches Paul, and southern Freman delights in Paul's triumphs. However, a northern Freman, Chani, isn't impressed. She doesn't subscribe to the prophecy because she thinks it's an enslavement tool. Paul confides in Chani about his apocalyptic dreams as the two become inseparable. Paul's dreams warn that traveling to Southern Arrakis will bring death to billions.<br/><br/>Glossu Rabban Harkonnen sends spice harvesters and soldiers to the northern part of the Arrakis. Since the death of Duke Leto, Baron Vladimir Harroken wants his nephew, Glossu, to regain control of spice production. Vladimir thinks Glossu is a doting foot soldier but doesn't believe Glossu is ready to lead. Vladimir wants his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha, to take the throne. Emperor Shaddam IV's Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam, agrees. Shaddam's daughter, Princess Irulan, disagrees because Feyd-Rautha is a psychopath. Irulan keeps a secret. She suspects that Paul and Jessica are alive but unsure of their location. Can Paul and the Fremans stop the Harroken with the Emperor and his people secretly working for them?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Dune by Frank Herbert and the sequel to Dune, this film deserves the most vivid screen and best sound an audience can find. The graphics are extraordinary and clean. The sound gives the script a proper build for its iconic moments. The story is captivating and dramatic. The script doesn't force its high-level wit on you and profoundly uses silence. On this surface, this movie is about empires fighting over a resource. However, this plot gently discusses religion and looting. This sequel is better than the first film and deserves your time and money. Its stunning fight scenes, jaw-dropping graphics, and compelling storyline are worth the running time.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Drive-Away Dolls",
    "review":"It's 1999 and Marian goes to a bar. She can't find her friends, Sukie and Jamie. Then, she hears Jamie on the microphone offering to let everyone do body shots. Jamie's girlfriend, Sukie, gets upset and punches Jamie. Jamie wants a road trip to clear her mind and forget her break-up. Marian wants to travel to Tallahassee to visit her aunt. Jamie convinces Marian to travel together in a drive-away car.<br/><br/>Drive-away shop owner Curlie receives a call. The caller wants his Dodge driven by two people to Tallahassee, and they will be there today. Curlie accepts the job before Marian and Jamie enter. They tell him they want to go to Tallahassee. So he gets contact information from Marian and Jamie and gives them the keys to the Dodge. And they drive away.<br/><br/>Arliss and Flint enter the shop and request the Dodge, going to Tallahassee. Curlie tells them he gave the job to two women. And they call their boss, Chief. Chief calmly demands the women's information. Chief tells them they must find the two women and get the car. It holds two deadly and life-ruining secrets inside. Will Marian and Jamie make it to Tallahassee before Arliss and Flint find them?<br/><br/>This movie takes time to build but exponentially ramps up the wildness. While the plot is crazy and raunchy, the 70s acid trips make a late 90s film feel disjointed. It's not until the last 20 minutes that you understand the meaning of the trippy and unnecessary flashbacks. If you are open-minded and want to watch a wild time, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Madame Web",
    "review":"In 1973, a pregnant Constance Webb searched the Peruvian Amazon rainforest for a spider with her partner Ezekiel Sims. As they march through the forest, Ezekiel questions Constance about the local legends. The indigenous people believe some spider-like men, called Las Arañas, troll the rainforest for wrongdoers. Constance laughs because she is a woman of science, not legends. Constance finds the spider and celebrates with the locals. Then, Ezekiel starts shooting and takes the spider. Constance goes into labor, and Las Arañas come from the trees. They place the spider on her chest as she delivers, and it bites her. She dies, but her daughter, Cassie, survives.<br/><br/>Cassie grew up in foster care and became an NYFD paramedic. She drives the ambulance to save a woman's life and almost runs into a prep school girl on a skateboard. Cassie and her partner, Ben, get the woman to the hospital in time, and the doctors save her life. The woman's stepdaughter thanks Cassie. Cassie returns home and walks past the landlord, arguing with her neighbor about back rent. She looks through some of Constance's notes before relaxing.<br/><br/>Cassie has a near-death experience before Ben saves her. Afterward, she keeps experiencing dèjá vu. Cassie believes this is a coincidence until Cassie has a vision about a co-worker, O'Neil, dying. She runs by his side, but it's too late. Her vision came true.<br/><br/>Cassie travels to attend O'Neil's funeral at the last minute and runs to the train station. She boards the train and has a vision of a man murdering three teenagers. She screams at the teens to leave the train when she spots the man walking toward them. Cassie tells the three teens to jump in the cab she steals. She realizes she recognizes the three teens. Julia is the stepdaughter of the woman Cassie saved. Anya lives in Cassie's building, and Mattie is the skateboarder. However, she doesn't know the man trying to kill them. It's Ezekiel. He allowed the spider to bite him in 1973. Now, he has superhuman strength and can see the future. He saw Julia, Anya, and Mattie with powers, killing him. He is determined to find and kill them before they get their powers. Can Cassie gain control of her powers and save Anya, Mattie, and Julia so they can fulfill their destiny?<br/><br/>This movie spends its time on character development and intrigue. For a moment, Cassie has a brief encounter with the teens. Once Cassie has a second to talk to them, they find a common thread: abandonment. The villain is ruthless and deserves more backstory. The director bravely chooses not to differentiate Cassie's visions from the real world at the start. As her bond with the ladies grows, the audience can see the change between Cassie's visions and the present. Be sure to pay attention because you will witness the birth of someone amazing. There are 0 mid- or post-credit scenes. This film is for you if you like character-driven superhero films with less action. Otherwise, wait for streaming.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Bob Marley: One Love",
    "review":"In 1976, Bob Marley and the Wailers met with reporters about their upcoming free concert in Jamaica. Some say that Bob's concert will strengthen the divide, but Bob maintains that he isn't picking a side. He wants to bring everyone peacefully together.<br/><br/>Bob plays with his friends and family and travels to practice before the concert. Bob's wife, Rita, sings background vocals but leaves to take care of things before the show. Rita sees several men approaching the house with guns. Before she can warn Bob and the band, a man shoots her in the head. The men run inside and shoot anyone moving. Bob and Rita survive their wounds and perform the concert two days later. He tells Rita to take the children and stay with Rita's mother in America while he records his next album in London. Soon, Bob wants to perform in Africa, but Rita worries his pursuits are pulling focus away from Jamaica. After financial disputes, domestic issues, and health problems, Bob will discover that delivering the message isn't enough. He has to become the message.<br/><br/>This film only covers a few years of Marley's life in detail. The documentary doesn't try to glamorize Bob or paint him as a hero. They allow the audience to see his motivation, artistic process, and determination. Also, it props up Rita's involvement in Bob's personal and professional life. Viewers will learn more about the man, his music, and his relationships.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
