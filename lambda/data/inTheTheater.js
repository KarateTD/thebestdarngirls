    "review":"Ember Lumen works for her dad, Bernie, at his convenience store, Fireplace. He creates food from his old country for the citizens of Fire City. And his wife, Cindy, reads customers' 'love smoke' in the back. Bernie hopes to retire and turn the place over to Ember. But only when she is ready. Ember is close, but her frustration with customers overcomes her and causes her to burst into flames.<br/><br/>Ember opens the shop in the morning to excited customers. However, it's too much, and she runs to the basement to explode. The pipes burst. Ember uses her heat to weld the metal and tries to figure out how to clear the water. She sees strange movement in the pool as Wade Ripple emerges from the water, holding her family picture. Wade is a city health inspector and jots down the violations. Ember pleads with Wade to stop because Bernie built it. Wade writes down that Bernie constructed the shop without the proper permits. Wade runs out of the store and on an Element City Train to report the violations to City Hall. Ember follows him and leaves Fire Town for the first time.<br/><br/>He files the paperwork as Ember falls devastated. The glow from Ember and her words sparks compassion in Wade. Wade knows a way to help. They can speak to Gale Cumulus, his boss, to halt the Fireplace's closure.<br/><br/>Wade mentions that water came through the pipes in Fire Town. Gale doesn't understand how this happened because the city shut off water to Fire Town years ago. Wade tells Gale he was looking for the source of a leak but was sucked into the pipe and landed in the Fireplace. Gale says she won't close the shop if they find the leak and stop it. She must save the Fireplace because it's her family's legacy and future. But is it the future she wants, or will chemistry find a new destiny for her?<br/><br/>This movie is an immigrant's tale. They leave their homeland after a natural or unnatural event. They come to a new world to start a better life but find hardship and exclusion. They pass that tradition and pride to Ember. Ember wants to be a good daughter and follow the path Bernie laid for her to follow. She never considered there could be another way. Then, she meets Wade. Wade has an abundant life but misses his deceased dad. He expresses his emotions and sees the best in others. Ember's ability to mold the world around her awes Wade. He doesn't understand why she can't leave her family's expectations behind. That difference is the film's core: an immigrant's duties versus a citizen's dreams. Also, the opening short film, Carl's Date, is an instant classic. So, everyone should be on time.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Barry goes to the local caf√© to get his regular sandwich, but his favorite sandwich artist isn't there. Barry gets a call from Alfred while waiting. Batman needs someone to save people from a building collapse while he stops the robbers.<br/><br/>After a daring rescue, Barry runs to the coffee shop to get his sandwich and arrives late to work. Barry works in criminal forensics but focuses on his father's case. His father, Henry, is in prison for killing Barry's mother, Nora. Bruce cleaned up the footage of Henry in the store before Nora's death. However, he never looked at the camera while wearing a baseball cap. Barry runs to their old house and remembers the last time he saw his mom. Nora notices she forgot the canned tomatoes for the spaghetti and asks Henry to get more. He went to the store and returned to hear Nora screaming. Barry ran downstairs after hearing Nora's cries for help and finds Henry holding Nora with a knife in her abdomen.<br/><br/>Barry's emotions get the best of him, and he runs faster than ever and inadvertently uses the Speed Force to travel one day in the past. Barry returns home and ponders a way to help Henry. Barry invokes the Speed Force and adds the tomatoes to Nora's cart. Barry starts the Speed Force again to return to his time, but something pushes him out to 2013. Nora is alive, Henry is free, and Barry sees his 18-year-old self in the driveway with laundry. Then, Barry realizes it's September 29th; the day he got his powers.<br/><br/>Barry takes his younger self to their job and puts the younger Barry in a chair behind the chemicals. He warns 2013-Barry that a lightning bolt will combine with the chemicals and shock him. 2013's Barry panics and attempts to stand. Barry pushes him down, and they both get hit. The younger Barry has powers, but the older Barry loses his. Barry steps away from 2013-Barry when he sees a world-ending news report. General Zod entered Earth's atmosphere with demands. Barry remembers this day. He was able to save one child because he didn't understand his powers, but Superman stopped Zod. 2013-Barry has never heard of Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, or Cyborg. Barry realizes his actions erased the Metahumans he remembers. Barry must find Batman, reform the Justice League, and save Earth without causing any more damage to the timeline.<br/><br/>This movie is a mix of an origin story and a coming-of-age story. The CGI of Barry meeting his younger self is flawless. And his slow-motion sequences add humor and realism to the wild moments. The larger fight scene, in the end, has a cartoon ascetic viewers come to expect from the D.C.E.U.. The plot drags as Barry looks for Batman and 2013's Kryptonian. This film is for D.C. fans looking for a matinee movie. Otherwise, wait for streaming on Max.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Noah prepares for a job interview in 1994 but notices something is wrong with his little brother's hand. Noah runs to his job interview after the hospital refuses to treat Chris. Unfortunately, the interview is over. They got word from Noah's former commanding officer. Noah is a tech whiz and a soldier but not a team player.<br/><br/>Noah returns home with Chris feeling defeated. Noah needs to make money now to help his family, so he takes a shortcut and uses his technical expertise to boost cars. He finds a beautiful Porsche and uses a Jimmy to get inside. Noah turns on the radio and hears a voice yelling for Mirage to roll out. The vehicle puts itself in gear and starts a high-speed chase. After a wild ride through the streets of New York, the car morphs into Autobot Mirage. Mirage tells Noah to be cool because the others are coming and are not fond of humans.<br/><br/>Across town, Elena interns at a museum. Her boss, Jillian, brought in a statue that she claimed to be Egyptian. But Elena thinks it's much older. Elena sees Jillian's lab tech badge and uses it to gain unauthorized access to the examination equipment. As she scans the item, it breaks apart and reveals something inside. She doesn't see a stream of light emanating from it, but Optimus Prime does.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is in awe of the light. He knows it comes from the Transwarp Key. The key opens portals through time and space. Optimus can use it to send himself and the Autobots to their home world, Cybertron. He calls the Autobots - Bumblebee, Mirage, and Acree - to plan a way into the museum. The Autobots catch Noah trying to sneak out as they discuss ways to retrieve the key. Mirage gets an idea. They can have Noah get the key for them. Optimus isn't keen on the idea, but he knows Scourge can see the beacon too.<br/><br/>Scourge leads the Terrorcons and works for Unicron. Unicron fuels himself by eating planets. Unicron sent Scourge to find the key to become unstoppable. The last time Scourge saw the key was on the homeworld of the Maximals. Their leader, Apelinq, sacrificed himself so the Maximals, including Optimus Primal, could escape with their greatest technology: the Transwarp key. Optimus knows it's a matter of time before Scourge comes to Earth looking for it.<br/><br/>Noah enters the museum, and Elena confronts him. The Terrorcons shoot a hole in the museum as they argue over the artifact. After battling on the museum's front lawn, Scourge destroys Bumblebee's spark and leaves with the key. However, they only got half the key. She believes the other half of the key is in Peru. Elena, Noah, and the Autobots head to Peru, with Scourge not far behind. Who will win the battle of the key?<br/><br/>Inspired by Transformers, this movie takes place after Bumblebee but serves as a prequel to the Transformers movie series. The intro gives the audience a glimpse of the Maximals and their mission before coming to Earth. However, the plot assumes you know the story of the Transformers. While Mirage delivers comic relief, the storyline focuses on brotherly relationships. The animation is crisp and not offputting. Luckily, the writers didn't add an unnecessary romance. Be prepared for a surprise in the final scene that will push this franchise into the future. Also, there is one mid-credit scene. This film is as enjoyable as Bumblebee but doesn't drag like the other Transformers films. It is a rejuvenated addition to the series.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Gwen quits another band and worries her father, Captain George, and Aunt May on Earth-65. During her school dance, a massive lizard tore through the party. Gwen jumped into costume and killed the mutant, but sadly learned the lizard was her mutated friend, Peter Parker. As she cried over her friend, George entered with his gun drawn. He assumes Spider-Woman killed Peter, and now he tracks Spider-Woman's every move.<br/><br/>George gets a call over the walkie-talkie that a monster broke into the Guggenheim Museum and leaves because he thinks Spider-Woman will be there. Gwen hears the call, puts on her costume, and follows them. She realizes the monster is the Vulture, but it's not of her world. Then, a portal opens, and Miguel O'Hara and Jessica Drew capture Vulture. She can tell they are from another universe and asks to join them. Jessica likes the idea, but Miguel says no. George escapes his webs and points a gun at Spider-Woman. Gwen reveals her identity to George, and he begins to read Gwen her rights. Gwen walks through the portal and leaves George behind.<br/><br/>Miles balances Spider-Man duties with his education on Earth-1610. His parents, Jeff and Rio, wait for Miles as they sit with his guidance counselor. In another part of Brooklyn, Miles faces a new villain called The Spot, a.k.a. Dr. Jonathan Ohnn. During the Alchemax explosion, portals engulfed Jonathan's body. Miles defeats him and leaves him on a rooftop for the authorities. Miles slides into his counselor's meeting and tells his parents he wants to attend Princeton. Miles Spider-sense tingles, and he abruptly leaves the meeting to recapture The Spot.<br/><br/>As Miles zones out to music, Gwen opens a portal and persuades Miles to leave the house. Miles follows Gwen through a portal to Earth-50101 when he discovers the truth. In that universe, Pavitr Prabhakah is Spider-Man in Mumbattan. Before battling The Spot in Pavitr's universe, they meet Hobie Brown, Spider-Punk. The Spot absorbs the powers of Pavitar's universe's Alchemax before the Spider-people can stop him. Miles gets a vision of Jeff dying during his next battle with The Spot. Then, the Spot disappears with Mumbattan glitching around them, and Miles risks his life to save a little girl and an Inspector from the collapsing universe. Gwen thinks it's time for Miles to enter the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>She loves having him there, but Miguel thinks it's a massive mistake because Miles caused the multiverse portals that allowed villains to escape their Earth. And to make matters worse, Miles stopped a Canon Event from happening when he saved the Inspector. Peter B. Parker joins them and explains that Canon Events are necessary for every Spider-Person to develop. Miles puts the pieces together and realizes they know Jeff will die. Miles wants to save Jeff, but the Spider-People stop him. They tell him that he can't save one person and sacrifice everyone else. Miles believes he can save Jeff and Earth-1610, but he must first break free of the Spider-Society.<br/><br/>This sequel is better than its predecessor and worth a visit to the theaters. Viewers get new versions of Spider-People with unique animation styles. Each new character, including the villains, has a rich backstory and superb wit. The writers added easter eggs from all 3 Spider-Man franchises. You will laugh with pure joy and excitement throughout this film. If the animation wasn't astounding enough, this film has more drama than a telenovela. There is one mid-credit scene. And the film ends on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Sebastian is the only child of Sicilian immigrant Salvo. Salvo raised Sebastian with a set of principles about men and their families. Men should always work, save money, and give their children a better life. Salvo moved to the United States 50 years ago and opened a hair salon to fulfill his 'better life' promise.<br/><br/>Sebastian works as a hotel manager for Hilton Hotels. His girlfriend, Ellie, is an artist. Her father, Bill, owns and operates the Collins Hotels, and her mother, Tigger, is a politician. He wants to receive their blessing and find the right place to propose. Bill and Tigger call Ellie and invite her and Sebastian to their summer home for the 4th of July. But the 4th is Salvo's favorite holiday, and Sebastian doesn't want to leave Salvo alone. Sebastian tells Salvo about the trip and his intentions to get his grandmother's wedding ring. Salvo says no because he doesn't know Ellie's family. Sebastian convinces Salvo to come but begs Salvo to be nice. He doesn't want Salvo to be too loud, too judgemental, or too cheap, but Sebastian will learn that he is the person that must change.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Sebastian's life, this film offers an endearing and funny look into family pride. Sebastian tries to stifle his father in front of Ellie's family. Nevertheless, in private, Sebastian admits he feels the same way about Bill and Tigger that Salvo does. While both families have different parenting styles, they have successful and caring children. This movie emphasizes that children must respect their roots to grow. Viewers should give this film their matinee money.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
