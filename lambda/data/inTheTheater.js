    "review":"After Hurricane Katrina, James hasn't been able to find a job as an artist.  He has an associates degree from Tulane and created a graphic novel called Cut Throat City. After FEMA turns down his aid request, James and his three friends - Junior, Miracle, and Dre, visit James's Cousin Bass. Bass gives them a job.  They have to rob a local casino and give Bass the cash and chips from the robbery. During the robbery, Miracle, the lookout and driver, sees several uniformed officers about to enter the casino.  Miracle starts shooting. After a high-speed shootout, Dre was hit and died. The next morning they see Bass.  Bass expects a lot of money because the newspaper says the robbers took $150,000.  However, James reports they only stole $25,000, but they spent some. Even if the paper lied, the suspects the men got $100,000, so Bass wants $80,000.  James promises to get the money with interest, but that's not good enough for Bass.  James calls his wife and tells her to leave town with their son, then goes into hiding.  On the other side of New Orleans, Detective Lucinda gets a call from the Councilman.  No police officers reported being in a shoot out.  The cops were fake, so someone set up James and his friends.  Until they know, James, Junior, and Miracle know they can't come back to the 9th ward without Bass's money.  They only know one way get back home: rob casinos and take the money to the Saint for safe passage.<br/><br/>Cut Throat City starts like a lot of heist movies; the main character is down on their luck and decides to do one crime to make things right. As the plot becomes more complicated, it starts to lose focus.  Instead of a heist movie, it becomes a movie about government and police corruption.  In the end, the conclusion gives an alternate ending, but you don't know where the fake ending started in the story.  So, you will have more questions than answers.  Hopefully, the DVD extras will explain it all.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ray wakes up with no memory of his past and Dr. Emil by his bedside.  His body was donated by the military to Rising Spirit Technologies, or R.S.T., because his family didn’t claim his body.  Ray is R.S.T’s first fully revived candidate.  Ray feels normal but Dr. Emil cuts his hand and puts it under a microscope.  Ray can see nanites repairing his cut before it has a chance to bleed.  Now, Ray is superhuman.  KT sees Ray is having a hard time adjusting so she offers to help Ray remember which alcohol he likes.  As they take shots, Psycho Killer is played over the speaker.  It jogs an agonizing memory.  Before Ray died, Martin Axe drugged him and kidnapped his wife, Gina.  Martin wanted to know how Ray knew about the hostage situation in Mombasa.  Ray explains that he was following orders and never knew who leaked the information.  Martin believes Ray but kills Gina with a bolt gun anyway.  Ray tells Martin that Martin better kill him or Ray will end his life.  Martin takes Ray on his suggestion and kills Ray.  Ray doesn’t know the killer was planted in his head.  Dr. Emil is using Ray to eliminate former RST employees that are a threat to his business.  When Ray discovers the truth, he will need to gain control of his new augmented body and bring down his creator.<br/><br/>Based on the Bloodshot comics, this movie doesn’t hold a candle to the comic.  The plot is a mix of Deadpool and Frankenstein but it still doesn’t excite you.  The graphics are cartoonish, the action mundane, and the plot overdone.  Thank goodness for the comic relief Wilfred.  This lovable computer genius is the wingman or ‘guy in the chair’ every superhero needs.<br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"With a brand new guitar, Jeremy Camp leaves home for Calvary Chapel Bible College.  After some time on campus, he sneaks backstage to hear and get tips from musician Jean-Luc.  Not only did Jean-Luc give Jeremy tips, but he also let Jeremy tune his guitar.  As Jeremy switches out the guitar, he sees a beautiful girl in the crowd.  After the concert, he introduces himself to Melissa.  The next day, she sees him play guitar under a tree.  She invites him to a bonfire and tells him to bring his guitar.  At the bonfire, Jeremy is surprised to see Jean-Luc there with Melissa.  She explains her relationship with Jean-Luc is complicated.  Jean-Luc wants more from their friendship but she doesn't.  Unknown to Jean-Luc, Jeremy and Melissa start to date.  The couple breaks up after a few months because Jeremy is tired of being a secret.  During winter break, Jeremy gets a phone call from Jean-Luc.  Melissa was taken to the hospital and it’s bad.  Melissa tells Jeremy she has stage C3 cancer.  They removed a cancerous growth, the size of an orange, from her stomach and she will start chemotherapy soon.  To keep the love of his life, Jeremy asks Melissa to marry him.   He is inspired to write songs for and ask fans to pray for his wife.  With those decisions, Jeremy will find the miracle before the supernova.<br/><br/>Based on I Still Believe by Jeremy Camp, this movie is a moving tribute to Melissa and the legacy she wanted to leave behind.  She wanted Jeremy to use her story to make people believe in faith and hope, not lose it during hard times.  It may not have the same outcome as Breakthrough, it does give you a powerful love story within a deeper love story.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Jack Cunningham drinks to wake up, in the shower, on the job, and a case to go to sleep at night.  Jack checks his messages and gets one from his old high school principal.  The principal wants him to coach the new boys' basketball team for Bishop Hayes High School.  The team hasn't had a good year since Jack played in 1995. The principal tells Jack to go home, think about it, and give him an answer in the morning.  Jack practices turning down the principal while drinking a case of beer.  With all his practice, Jack shows up the next morning. Jack sits on the sidelines and watches the boys play.  Jack can't fathom having so few players on the team.  They have to borrow players from the J.V. team just to practice.  Jack sees their best shooter can't make a 3-pointer and the best guy on the team doesn't talk. Their way back to the playoffs is his way back to life.  When his past comes back to haunt him, will the old Jack resurface?<br/><br/>This feels like an episode of Intervention without the confessionals.  You don't have a true understanding of how bad Jack's drinking is until he drinks a case of beer in a few hours.  There is a moment of parallel in the storyline. Marcus is begging to stay on the team after Jack kicks him off for being late and disobedient.  By the end of the film, Jack's drinking leads him to a car crash, breaking and entering, and missed practices.  He has to beg to coach the team like Marcus.  Seeing him beg for a second chance to fix his life will rock you to the core.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
