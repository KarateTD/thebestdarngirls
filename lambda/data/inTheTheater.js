    "review":"Mike is facing a tough choice.  His heart is in the secret service action.  But his body can't take the pounding.  President Trumbull and Mike's wife Leah encourages him to take the jobs as Director of the Secret Service.  Before Mike can answer, the president is hit with a drone strike.  When Mike wakes up, his entire team is dead, the president is in a coma, and he is the number one suspect.  Mike has to find out who attacked the president or end up in jail.  Good thing he has dear old dad to help.<br/><br/>While this movie is better than the second, it still does not live up to the first.  However, it is more grounded in reality with discussion on pill dependencies, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and father-son relationships.  If you are a fan of the Fallen series, see the matinee.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Luce",
    "review":"Adopted from war-torn Eritrea 10 years ago, Luce is an exemplary student, star athlete, and famed speaker within his school.  His mother Amy is confused when she gets a call from Ms. Wilson to discuss Luce.  Ms. Wilson gave the class an assignment to write a paper in the voice of a famous person.  Luce chose a war criminal who uses violence to settle political disputes.  Frightened by the paper, Ms. Wilson searches Luce's locker and finds illegal fireworks.  Now everyone is questioning Luce's past versus his present.  But, are the questions justified?<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that leaves with you and keeps you up at night.  Luce is a complex character with many sides.  While some would see his actions as warranted, others would see it as psychopathic.  While you never know the whole truth, you are left wondering: who is the real Luce.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Former foster child, Grace is happy to start a permanent family with her husband Alex.  On their wedding day, several of his family members make it known that they don't like her.  But his mother and brother Daniel are the exceptions.  On their wedding night, the couple is asked to join the family.  Whenever someone new enters the family, they play a game.  Some got checkers or Old Maid.  Grace picks the Hide and Seek card.  She has to hide in the house and not be found until sunrise.   Unbeknownst to Grace, while she is finding a hiding spot, Alex's family are gathering weapons.  Years ago, their ancestor made a deal.  If a person picks the Hide and Seek card, they must be killed by sunrise or the family will die.  Alex has to find and save Grace before his family kills her.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the premises.  Grace is not a damsel in distress.  Once she learns the deadly nature of the game, she changes her shoes and rips her wedding dress.  She refuses to go quietly and gives his family a bloody and funny run for their money.  Be advised, this isn't like The Purge.  It is far funnier and a true portrayal of a dysfunctional family.  See it and have a good laugh.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Max is invited to a kissing party with the popular kids, including his crush.  Max requests for the invitation to be extended to his friends Thor and Lucas.   The cool kids decide to let them all come.  Now, Max has one big problem: he has to learn how to kiss.  After several failed attempts to learn kissing, they use Max's dad's drone to watch Thor's neighbor kiss her boyfriend.  She spots the drone and takes it out.  Max has to get the drone back or he will be grounded and can't attend the party.<br/><br/>As a warning, if you can't handle seeing kids curse, drink, and play with adult toys, this isn't the movie for you.  This coming-of-age story is just as raunchy as Superbad.  And with everything being so over-the-top, the resolution was the most honest and heartfelt of anything in this movie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Bernadette has been slowly falling apart since she lost her desire to design.  Now, her husband Elgin is worried she is suicidal.  On the other hand, her daughter Bee believes her mother just needs space.  After a call from the FBI, Elgin orchestrates an intervention.  During the intervention, Bernadette escapes and goes missing.  Elgin believes she will come back on her own but her daughter wants to look for her.  So, where'd you go, Bernadette?<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the title.  This isn't a mystery of where did she go physically but mentally.  You always know where Bernadette is located but not what originally caused her to lose her love of design.  If you are into cynical humor and personal growth stories, see this one matinee.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
