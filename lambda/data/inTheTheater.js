    "review":"It's been ten years since the Na'vi kicked humans off Omaticaya, but a few stayed. Dr. Norm and Dr. Max remained because they sided with the Na'vi and continued their studies. The humans left Spider behind because he was too young to go into cryostasis. He is the son of Colonel Miles and loves to be in the Pandora rainforest with Jake and his family instead of other humans. Jake and Neytiri have four children.<br/><br/>During date night, Jake and Neytiri notice an extra star in the sky. The humans are back. They create a massive fireball to destroy several habitats. However, Jake prepared the Na'vi, and they are battle ready. Spider, Kiri, Tuk, and Lo'ak go to Jake and Miles's last battle site. They find Na'vi in full camouflage and guns. The humans cloned Na'vi bodies and implanted a person's personality and memories in the bodies. Now, Colonel Miles is a walking Na'vi Trojan horse.<br/><br/>After a standoff between Jake and Miles, Miles takes Spider, and Jake runs with his kids. Staying will bring more devastation to her people, so they must leave their life behind. Jake and his family travel to the water and meet with Tonowari. He leads the reef people of Metkayina with his wife, Ronal, by his side. Jake and his family must learn the way of the water to survive on the reef. And they need to study it quickly. Cloning Na'vi isn't the only thing humans desire. However, Miles's need for revenge is his driving force to hunt Jake and his entire family with a captive Spider assisting.<br/><br/>The sequel to Avatar expands the cinematic world by introducing the reef people. Viewers get new animals, plant life, and customs in this new environment. This movie has a lengthy running time, but it doesn't feel 3 hours long. The audience is so immersed in the scenes and culture that you don't mind. The animators did a magnificent job blending real people with motion-capture characters. The moment Tonowari and Ronal discuss Jake and his family staying is the best-animated scene, and it had zero words. Tonowari and Ronal give each other stern looks, loving eyes, and a plea. You will laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer throughout the movie. This film goes beyond what fans expect and is worth the 13-year wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Santa Claus stops at a bar in England and drinks before delivering presents to nice boys and girls. But people's growing greed and selfishness leave Santa jaded about the holidays. He gets in his sleigh and heads into the night.<br/><br/>In Connecticut, Jason waits for his estranged wife, Linda, and their daughter, Trudy, with a gift for his mother, Gertrude. Trudy admits she's sad because Jason didn't take her to see Santa and make her Christmas wish. They arrive at Gertrude's massive estate, and Jason's sister, Alva, is there with her son, Bert, and boyfriend, Morgan. Alva accuses Jason of sucking up to Gertrude for the business, but Jason ignores her.<br/><br/>Later that night, Jason still feels guilty for Trudy missing Santa. So he wraps up a walkie-talkie with earbuds and gives it to her. He tells Trudy it's a magic walkie-talkie that can communicate directly with Santa. As Trudy sleeps, the adults argue about the company, Christmas gifts, and money. They don't notice the catering staff has guns and kills security. A man called Scrooge enters and demands cash from Gertrude. Sources told Scrooge that Gertrude stole $300,000,000 from the government and hid it in a vault on the property. Until they get the money, Scrooge and his accomplices will hold the family hostage.<br/><br/>Upstairs, Santa eats cookies, drinks Bourbon, and sits in a massage chair. He hears the commotion downstairs and tries to escape. However, his magic isn't working. Frosty, a henchman, spots Santa and gets into a bloody battle. As Santa looks for another way to escape, he hears a sound coming from the closet. He finds the other walkie-talkie and answers Trudy. She tells Santa she's in danger and begs for help. Santa checks his scroll and sees she's on the nice list. He tells Trudy not to worry because Santa is coming to town.<br/><br/>So what if Bad Santa, John Wick, and Kevin McCallister worked together to stop the murderous Wet Bandits? Well, watch this movie and find out. The audience knows this is the real Santa at the beginning, but he has issues. And his skull-crushing origin story tells the darkness behind the red suit. This movie isn't for the faint of heart. It's for the Die Hard Christmas fans that want to break out of the Christmas rom-com rut. The fight scenes are stellar, and the Christmas magic isn't sappy or clich√©. Step away from the ordinary and have a blood-and-guts Christmas.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Lieutenant Tom Hudner enters the locker room to greet his fellow soldiers and hears someone mumbling to themselves. Before Tom can investigate, his airmen walk in, say hello, and rib him. One soldier, Ensign Jesse Brown, is standoffish, but Tom shakes his hand. Tom attempts to get closer to Jesse, but Jesse keeps his guard up. Until Tom offers Jesse a ride home because Jesse's car broke down. Tom meets Jesse's wife, Daisy, and their daughter, Pam. Daisy invites Tom in for a beer. She worries because the U.S. government gave the airmen their first mission. They will lend air support to the Korean War. Pam makes Tom promise to watch over Jesse. A new aircraft, some backward attitudes, and heavy firefights will test Tom's devotion to his promise.<br/><br/>Based on Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice by Adam Makos, this movie stands out from other historical tellings because there isn't a bad guy. Although Jesse receives media attention for his race and naval status, he doesn't want that to define him. Only his dedication to the country. Tom is a true definition of an ally. He quickly points out others' wrongdoings and listens to Jesse with an ear of compassion, not pity. This movie will leave a tear in your eye and gives these men their due.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Strange World",
    "review":"The town of Avalonia lives in the dark ages, surrounded by mountains. Explorer Jaeger Clade believes salvation is on the other side of the mountains. So, he sets out with his crew, including his son, Searcher, to trek to the other side. Searcher notices a glowing plant on the ground and tries to touch it, but it shocks him. He wants to harvest it and learn more about it. Jaeger tells Searcher that they are on a mission to save Avalonia, not garden plants. Searcher takes a stand against Jaeger, and Jaeger asks the crew to choose sides. They pick Searcher. Jaeger goes into the unknown alone and disappears.<br/><br/>Twenty-five years later, Searcher is famous for discovering Pando, the green-glowing plant. It powers Avalonia, and the townspeople develop their technology quickly. Searcher married another harvester, Meridian, and they have a teenage son, Ethan.<br/><br/>The leader of Avalonia, Callisto, comes to Searcher's farm. They are old friends because Callisto was on Jaeger's exploration team before she defected. She tells Searcher that Pando is dying everywhere, and they need to find the source of the problem. Searcher leaves with Callisto and travels to the Pando's roots inside a sinkhole. As they descend, Meridian catches up because Ethan stowed away on the Callisto's airship. Searcher finds Ethan with their dog, Legend, and begins to scold him. Then, the airship crash lands, causing Searcher to go overboard with Legend. Meridian explains it will be easier to save Searcher with the aircraft fixed. However, Ethan sneaks away to look for Searcher.<br/><br/>Curious Searcher looks around the unknown lands and discovers creatures unlike any other. When he bumps into one, it screams like him. The brute pulls up his mask, and Searcher sees his long-lost father standing before him. Jaeger warns Searcher that everything in this strange world wants to kill them. Everyone will need each other to save Pando and Avalonia.<br/><br/>This movie's animation is off the charts with unique techniques and more profound meaning to each life form. Once you understand the full scope of the film, the style choices for each Strange World character will make sense. Of course, there is more than meets the eye, but family is the story's core. While the movie is predictable, it's funny, heartwarming, and compelling.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",
    "review":"A year after King T'Challa died, Princess Shuri worked tirelessly to update Wakandan technology, but she stopped trying to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb. Her mother, Queen Ramonda, is fighting a political war with the United Nations. She will never share vibranium until the world is trustworthy. Ramonda returns home to make Shuri take part in a ritual. One year after a loved one passes, you burn your funeral ceremonial robe to honor them and relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>Shuri goes to the water's edge and watches Ramonda throw her robe into the fire, but Shuri refuses. Then, they notice a man coming from the water with wings on his ankles. Ramonda and Shuri dawn spears and demand to know who he is and why he speaks to them. He says his allies call him K'uk'ulkan, but his enemies say Namor. He says that Wakanda exposed his kingdom, Talokan, to great danger when they revealed the secret of vibranium. An American scientist was able to build a device that could detect the presence of the material. They want the Wakandans to bring them the American scientist so they can kill her, or they will destroy Wakanda.<br/><br/>Okoye decides to track down Agent Ross to reveal the location of the American scientist, and she convinces Ramonda to let Shuri go with her to get Shuri out of the lab. They unapologetically convince RiRi to come to Wakanda to keep her safe from a threat of unknown strength. However, Okoye and Shuri encounter hostile agents during their RiRi rescue, and Talokan warriors kidnap two of the women. Now, K'uk'ulkan gives Wakanda two options. One: Join his fight to destroy the land dwellers before they destroy his homeland for their resources. Or two: He will drown Wakanda and everyone in it.<br/><br/>And that's act one of this gut-wrenching, exciting, and loving tribute to Marvel's beloved king. The opening scene and the title card will have everyone in tears as it pays homage to a worthy figure in life and the comics. Then the plot introduces viewers to a new world with stunning but somewhat realistic imagery. You can see how this world mirrors Wakanda. Shuri and K'uk'ulkan are two sides of the same coin. They are children dealing with generational pain and devasting loss in a homeland under constant threat. RiRi is the new kid on the block. She swears, is an open book, and, while a bit naive, has some trust issues. It should go without saying, but the costumes, makeup, and art are second to none and help you delve deeper into this history-rich mythical world. Stay for the mid-credit scene, but their isn't an end-credit scene.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
