    "mtitle":"Gigi and Nate",
    "review":"Carolyn enters a petting zoo in California, which doubles as a traveling circus, and finds a scared capuchin monkey named Gigi. She coaxes the primate out of her corner and into a cage. Carolyn and her facility spend years training Gigi to become a service monkey.<br/><br/>Nate stood at the top of a cliff and jumped into the water while his friend, Benji, filmed it. A few days later, Nate celebrates the 4th of July with his mother, Claire, grandmother, Mama Blanche, and sisters, Katy and Annabelle. His father, Dan, couldn't make it because thunderstorms delayed his flight. Before dinner is over, Nate is in the bathroom, burning up, and vomiting. They rush Nate to the hospital, and the doctors run tests. There, doctors diagnose Nate with meningitis. It caused Nate's brain to swell, and now Nate can barely move his arms and legs.<br/><br/>Four years later, Nate, in a wheelchair, attempts to end his life. Dan saves him, and Claire makes a phone call to Carolyn. Carolyn tells Claire that Gigi is ready to help Nate, but it will take time for Gigi to adjust to Nate, Nate's surroundings, and Nate's needs. Nate takes Gigi everywhere for newfound independence. As they walk up and down the grocery aisles, a woman, Chloe, approaches Nate about Gigi. Chloe tells Nate and Claire that having Gigi around food products is against the law. Nate apologizes and leaves, but Claire gives Chloe a stern warning. After a party, social media, and beer pong, animal rights activists want to take Gigi away from Nate. Nate needs to convince the court that Gigi is safe and capuchins are suitable service animals.<br/><br/>Gigi and Nate's writers give viewers time to understand and appreciate the bond between a human and primate with wit, patience, and curious moments. And yes, the story is about Gigi, but it does not put the sole focus on her. It allows Nate's older sister, Katy, and parents, Claire and Dan, to connect with the audience and share their personal struggles. However, it doesn't offer an update for the actual Nate and Gigi. Also, the edits and CGI of the monkey versus dog chase lack the technical know-how and take the viewers out of the movie experience.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Easter Sunday",
    "review":"Jo takes his son, Junior, to school and promises to make the teacher-parent conference later. The meeting is at three, and Jo has an audition at 2. Jo tells Junior he will make it.<br/><br/>The audition runs late, but Jo does a great job. But they want Jo to do the lines in a Filipino accent. Jo refuses and calls his agent, Nick, on the way to the meeting. Nick pretends to lose the connection and hangs up. Then, Jo's mom, Susan, calls and wants to know if Jo is coming for Easter Sunday dinner. After a guilt trip, Jo says he is coming and bringing Junior.<br/><br/>Jo and Junior arrive at a battlefield between Susan and Jo's aunt, Teresa. Jo's sister, Regina, tells Jo that Teresa is hosting Easter lunch and Susan is hosting Easter dinner, but neither is attending the others. The family, including Regina, expects Jo to bring peace.<br/><br/>Jo sees his cousin, Eugene, pull up in a truck he and Jo invested in. However, it's not the taco truck Jo expected. It's a Hype-truck. Susan tells them to stop arguing and go inside the church for the Easter service. Jo sits next to Eugene during the sermon and wants to know where his $20,000 investment went. When the pastor hears $20,000, he assumes it's Jo's donation. Jo apologizes and puts in $40, but the pastor wants Jo to put his comedy routine to the test and preach in front of the congregation. Jo performs a skit about his family and gets Teresa and Susan to agree to go to each other's Easter events.<br/><br/>At lunch, Susan refuses to eat Teresa's food and tells Jo to do the same. Junior leaves the bickering to talk to Eugene about the Hype-truck. But Eugene starts to panic when he sees a man standing in the shadows and drives off. Soon, a man, Dev Deluxe, gets out of his car and tells Jo that Eugene owes him $40,000. Jo finds Eugene hiding in Susan's basement and demands a solution. Eugene unveils Manny Pacquiao's gloves from his famous Las Vegas fight. Eugene stole the gloves from Dev because Dev took them from the arena. Jo feels like it's a pyramid scheme but agrees. Jo concludes that he has a sound solution, but Nick calls. The network wants to talk about him doing the show without an accent, but he has to leave Easter dinner to make it to the meeting. Can Jo save Eugene, bring peace to Susan and Teresa, and get the role?<br/><br/>Welcome to the story of an American family. It's loud, funny, and complicated, but the love always shines through. Viewers will connect with this family while watching this effortless comedy and find relatable moments. Unlike some movies, this one isn't about generational trauma. No family is perfect, but it will stand if love is the family's foundation. By the way, what do you think about baby Jesus?<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Top Gun: Maverick",
    "review":"Maverick rides to the site to test the new aircraft.  Chief Warrant Officer 4 Hondo tells Maverick that the project is over.  Since the new aircraft hasn't reached MACH 10, the government doesn't want to invest more money.  Maverick expected to hit MACH 9 today, not 10, but the commander, Rear Admiral Hammer, is coming to give them the final verdict.  When the commander enters, Maverick is in the air and at MACH 7.  He successfully reaches MACH 10 but goes slightly over and lands in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>Maverick arrives to take his punishment.  But Iceman got Maverick a new assignment.  They tell Maverick to report to Top Gun to train Top Gun graduates for their next mission.  A foreign government will have enriched uranium in 3 weeks unless US forces can take out their bunker.  This mission would be easy.  However, mountains surround the bunker, and missiles with GPS are on top of the mountains.  The current planes can't make the trip, so they have to use two F/A-18 Hornets and two F/A-18E F Super Hornets.  And they have to fly these aircraft at a speed, altitude, and incline at which the engineers didn't design for them to do.  Maverick decides to train the graduates until he sees one team member: Rooster.   Rooster is the son of Goose, Maverick's wingman that died in training.  Maverick can't face him and doesn't want to teach.  However, Vice Admiral Cyclone's original plan doesn't mention the graduates coming home.  He will train the graduates to complete the mission and survive it.<br/><br/>Sequel to the 1986 Top Gun, this movie gives you the expected and unexpected action, thrills, and chills of its predecessor.  Viewers need to see this film with the loudest speakers because the engine's roar will shake your seat.  The writers made sure not to alienate their Top Gun fans.  It has the same opening crawl, intro music, and jacket as the first.  If you didn't see the first movie, the script covers Goose's final moments with the song Great Balls of Fire as a mental trigger.  It entices new fans with actual aerial maneuvers, new characters, and military planes.  You can feel the difference when the director strips away the CGI.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars",

    "mtitle":"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent",
    "review":"Nicolas Cage desperately auditioned for a role because he believed it was a once-in-a-lifetime part.  And he needs the money.  His agent, Richard Fink, got a call from Nick's accountant.  Nick owes his hotel $600,000. While Nick didn't get the part, Fink has an offer for Nick.  A billionaire wants Nick to come to his birthday party for $1 million.  Nick says no and goes to therapy with his daughter, Abby.  Nick drops off Abby at the home of his ex-wife, Olivia.  Olivia reminds Nick that Abby's Sweet 16 party is tonight.  Nick promises to make it and heads back to his hotel; only his keycard doesn't work.  Feeling at his lowest, Nick calls Fink and says yes to Javi Gutierrez's birthday party.<br/><br/>When Nick lands in Mallorca, a fan, Vivian, approaches him for a picture.  But she has another motive.  Vivian is a CIA agent investigating Javi.  She and her partner, Martin, think Javi is a drug lord who kidnapped the daughter, Maria, of a president to make the president drop out of the election.  So, they must save Maria by putting a tracker in Nick's pocket.<br/><br/>At Javi's compound, Javi welcomes Nick with open arms. Javi sent his screenplay to Fink because he wants Nick to star in it.  After Javi works up the nerve to ask, Nick gives Javi disappointing information: Nick is retiring from acting.  Vivian and Martin grab Nick off the street and give Nick details about Javi.  They need Nick to stay at Javi's and look for Maria.  So, Nick tells Javi he will help Javi write a new screenplay to give Nick the time he needs to find Maria.  When Javi discovers Nick's intentions, will Nick be able to use his acting skills to get out of the situation?<br/><br/>This buddy-comedy movie allows Nick to laugh at himself and the movie's wild plot.  At certain moments, the conversation is so in-line with the action that you feel like Nick and Javi are narrating it.  One thing for sure: Nick gets the joke.  It allows viewers to see fandom at its best and worst.  This movie is a guaranteed laugh, but it doesn't spark an interest to buy.  But don't be surprised if you have a newfound respect for Nicolas Cage, Face-Off, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and Paddington 2.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story",
    "review":"Kurt Warner watched Super Bowl 19, and Joe Montana inspired him to play.  With the odds stacked against him, Kurt joined the University of Northern Iowa football team.  He wants to make a highlight reel for agents and the NFL draft.  So, Kurt asks Coach Allen to give him a chance.  After a grueling practice, Kurt gets to start and make enough plays for his reel.<br/><br/>One night, Mike Hudnutt invites Kurt to go line dancing.  He sees a beautiful woman on the dance floor, and she gives him a look.  The next day, Kurt begs Mike to teach him how to dance.  Later, Kurt asks the woman for a dance.  Before their final dance, she tells Kurt that she's Brenda and leaves.  Brenda tells Kurt it won't work because she is a divorced mom with two kids.  To Brenda's surprise, Kurt shows up at her door the next day with a rose.  Her oldest son, Zack, lets Kurt into the house, and they bond instantly.<br/><br/>After a successful string of games, Kurt finds an agent and waits on the NFL draft picks.  Though the NFL didn't draft him, the Green Bay Packers hired him with a $5,000 signing bonus.  After two days, the Packers cut him.  Jim Foster sits at their table and offers Kurt a position with the Arena Football League during a rare date night for Kurt and Brenda.  Kurt laughs and calls it a place for players going down the drain.  Kurt doesn't plan on joining unless heck freezes over.  Well, Kurt will get his wish and his first step into the NFL.<br/><br/>Based on All Things Possible: My Story of Faith, Football, and the First Miracle Season by Kurt Warner, this movie proves perseverance wins overall.  As the film begins, viewers get the stats of high school players moving to college and then to the NFL.  Hearing these stats allows you to understand the odds Kurt faced on his way to becoming MVP in Super Bowl 34.  From learning how to dance, risking life and limb for his family, and staying in the pocket, Kurt's difficult moments prepared him for the next step in life and the game.  But, it's what Kurt does off the field that gives him joy.  His work with Treasure House brings him and Brenda more pride than his football career.  Also, the film does a great job of blending old footage with today's filming.  While the story is encouraging and gives you a sense of faith, you won't have an urge to buy or watch again.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
