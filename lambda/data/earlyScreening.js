    "review":"Four years after COVID-19, COVID-23 is airborne, affects the brain, and causes rapid death.  Anyone without an immunity bracelet must stay inside at all times and do a 9 a.m. health scan with their phone.  If they fail the scan, the sanitation department comes to their door with armed guards and escorts them to the Q Zone, also known as the quick death zone.  Some would consider Nico one of the lucky few because he has an immunity bracelet. During the worldwide lockdown, he met Sara. Sara lives with her grandmother and sees people pulled away by Emmett and the sanitation department all the time. On the other side of town, Piper and William raise their daughter, Emma.  While they are immuned, Emma has a weak immune system and could get sick with ease. To make money, Piper and William sell black market immunity bracelets to powerful and wealthy people.  As Piper takes every precaution, William leaves in a suit and breathing mask to meet his mistress, May.  May sings online under the handle MayDay, and people watch and donate money. Their intertwined lives will come to a deadly end when someone gets sick and fails a health check.  They will need an immunity bracelet or die in the Q Zone.<br/><br/>While setting the current pandemic four years in the future, this movie is a mix between Crash and Mission Impossible.  This movie does cover a lot of topics like immuned people passing a disease, disease mutation, and proper quarantine techniques. However, at the core of this movie are three love stories and one obsession story.  The pandemic causes and affects each of these stories.  Seeing the satisfyingly bloody end will entice you to keep watching.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Alice sits on a bed and reads a story to her children about her childhood.  Years ago, Alice had two brothers, Peter and David.  The children love to play in the woods a pretend to have sword fights, throw arrows, and battle pirates. Their mother, Rose, gives Alice a tinker's bell.  She tells Alice she can summon fairies with it. David is the smartest of the three children and never wants to grow up.  Peter, like his father, Jack, is an excellent carver.  Without Jack's knowledge, Eleanor enrolled David in boarding school.  Before David can converse with Rose about the matter, Rose explains that she has accepted Eleanor's offer.  All three children are upset David is leaving. David and Peter went into the woods to play, and David slipped into the water and drowned. Amid his pain, Jack goes to the local underground casino and creates a massive debt.  CJ wants his money tonight, and Jack writes an IOU on a napkin.  He goes home and believes he is even with CJ.  But, someone throws a brick through Jack's window with the napkin attached.  Alice and Peter take it upon themselves to help their dad.  They have no idea the wheels they will set in motion, linking their father's past, their imagination, and divided futures.<br/><br/>Based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie, this isn't the tale you know.  It's the tale of how Peter and Alice came to be.  One event gave Alice and Peter the same pain, but they handled it in different ways. With the intertwining stories, it's the special effects merging the children's fantasies with their reality that will make you do a double-take.  It's reminiscent of Rugrats. Sit back and enjoy with children six and up.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Suffering from a debilitating lung disease, Jorge Bacardi's exceeded expectations when he lived past his 10th birthday.  Jorge continued to defeat the odds, graduated from Stanford, and worked in his family's business.  Before boarding a Pan Am flight, Jorge locks eyes on an American flight attendant and can't stop staring. He asks her to hold his hand.  They are inseparable.  Soon, Jorge and Leslie marry, but they know his health will deteriorate every day.

Chris surprises Sam when he signs up.  Then, she tells Chris that he will be picking people up and giving them a safe ride to their dorms.  Chris takes a deep breath and admits he doesn't have a license.  He promises to be her Safety Buddy during the pick-ups if she teaches him how to drive.  Both couples fall in love during their space and time.  However, their worlds collide after one unfortunate tragic event. With pain, hope, and strength, these two families will connect and find peace with a simple promise: I'll take care of him.  They kept their promise with the Gabriel House of Care.<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story and based on All My Tomorrows by Brian Gregory, the couples are timeless with love that provides heartbreak and hope.  Intertwining the love stories makes the overall plot spellbinding. The story gives the Gregory family and the audience a look at what could have been if the outcome was different.  This movie is great for an emotional date night, an outing with faith-based friends, or the start of a serious discussion.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After taking one photography class at Boston University, Pete Souza graduated with the dream of becoming a photographer.  After working for a few periodicals, a friend told him to apply for the Chief White House Photographer job for President Ronald Reagan. Once hired, Pete believed it was his responsibility to capture the President as a leader and human being while capturing important moments in history.  Pete snapped photos of President Reagan with First Lady Nancy in moments of fun, pain, and triumph. When President Reagan left office, Pete assumed his career in the White House was complete, but he was wrong.  While working at the Chicago Times, someone asked Pete to photograph a promising, young Chicago senator. Accepting the job will change Pete's view of photography, the White House, and the future of our country.  He would try to take a sip of water from a firehose that was always on.<br/><br/>Based on Obama: An Intimate Portrait and Shade: The Tale of Two Presidents, this movie isn't about two presidents.  It's about the evolution of Pete.  This man, who witnessed defining moments in history from the highest viewpoint of the country, decided to no longer be the invisible fly on the wall. Pete feels the photographers are not allowed to cover history and life; they collect photo ops. His social media following grew, and the fly decided to sting like a bee. While this is a new look at the President, his family, and his job, it's not for President Trump's die-hard fans.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"A SWAT team must extract a CIA operative before the enemy can eliminate him.  On the way out, the protagonist finds a unique artifact and grabs it.  He puts the CIA operative in a van, but the enemy is inside and knocks them both out. He wakes up in a ship's medical bay.  He has been in a coma for months while medical staff saved his life.  However, his SWAT team died.  The operative and the artifact they wanted to save is gone.  They want to invite the protagonist to a program called Tenet.  Tenet's mission is to stop World War three.  Not a nuclear war, but a temporal war. Laura shows the protagonist an inverted bullet.  Instead of shooting a bullet from his gun, the protagonist is catching the bullet fired in the future.  This inverted technology blows the protagonist's mind.  The protagonist doesn't know who designed the technology, but he knows who to ask.  An arms dealer in Mumbai, on the top floor of a highly guarded fortress.  The protagonist calls his boss and tells the boss he will need help.  The boss sends Neil.  This temporal war will have the protagonist and Neil face to face with a controlling husband, a plane crash, and the inverted.<br/><br/>Tenet is a movie you will need to see twice.  Not just for the stunning cinematography, but to keep up with the storyline.  With time moving forwards and backward, you see the same scene but from a different angle.  It's captivating to see how the inverted and the non-inverted interact in the same space.  At one moment, a building is being put back together and destroyed at the same time.  The scene will leave you wonderstruck.  See it in IMAX to take it all in and pay attention to every detail.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
