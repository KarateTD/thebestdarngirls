    "review":"Riff and the Jets go through the Puerto Rican part of town and harass the locals. After an altercation with a rival Puerto Rican gang, the Sharks, Riff wants to arrange a fight.  But he wants to do it with Tony by his side.  Tony was a Jet until he spent time in prison for nearly beating a man to death.  Now, he works in Doc's pharmacy for Valentina.<br/><br/>María lives with her brother, Bernardo, and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita.  Bernardo picked the perfect guy to bring Maríe to the dance, Chino. Bernardo tells María to stay away from gringos and only dance with Chino.<br/><br/>At the dance, the Jets take over the dance floor. When Tony arrives, he spots María and can't take his eyes off her.  When María sees Tony, she sneaks off the dancefloor and under the bleachers.  Face-to-face, she realizes Tony isn't Puerto Rican and doesn't care.  They dance together.  But when Anita calls for María, the Sharks and Jets see the two together.  Bernardo erupts and tells Tony to stay away from María. Bernardo and Riff go to the bathroom with their gangs to talk.  Since neither will back down, they will have one final rumble for the territory. Bernardo agrees if Tony comes too.<br/><br/>Tony finds María's home and convinces her to meet him later.  They decide to let love rule and date.  On their date, María asks Tony to stop the fight because he was the leader of the Jets. Seeing her anguish, Tony will go to the rumble and talk both gangs down.  Can love conquer all?<br/><br/>Based on the play and the 1961 movie, this film stays true to the original while fixing issues from the past.  This movie covers race, love, gentrification, and gang dynamics using the same dialogue. Because of larger sets, they can perform awe-inspiring dance numbers with compelling camera angles. Mr. Spielberg even takes set designs and backdrops from the original play.  If you are not a fan of the musical, this isn't the one for you.  But give it a try.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Clifford the Big Red Dog",
    "review":"Emily feels like the odd girl out because she is a scholarship student at an elite private school. While her mother, Maggie, wants to help, Emily decides to deal with it on her terms.  Maggie has to go out of town for work, and much to Emily's chagrin, her uncle Casey is the only available babysitter. As Casey walks Emily to school, Emily sees Mr. Bridwell's Animal Rescue tent at school. Mr. Bridwell takes them to an empty part of the tent and directs Emily to go up the stairs.  Up there, Emily finds a bright red dog. Emily questions Mr. Bridwell about the dog.  Mr. Bridwell says that someone abandoned the dog, and it will grow to the size of the love in her heart.  However, they leave the dog behind. As she lays on the bed, Emily sees her bookbag move.  Emily opens the bookbag to find the red dog inside.  She names the dog Clifford and attempts to hide it from Casey.  The plan fails in an instant when Clifford steals Casey's lunch.<br/><br/>He lets Emily have Clifford for the night, but they will return the dog in the morning. Casey wants to return the large dog to Mr. Bridwell, but they can't find him on the internet.  So they decide to take Clifford to the vet instead.  A few of the neighbors film Clifford, and it goes viral.  The video catches the attention of Life Grow's CEO, Zack Tieran.  His company spent $400 million attempting to reduce hunger by creating genetically-engineered enormous food.  He thinks Clifford will be the key, and nothing will stop Zack from getting the big red dog.<br/><br/>Based on Clifford the Big Red Dog by Norman Bridwell, this movie teaches as it entertains.  And Emily learns two lessons.  First, being unique is good. Second, you must speak up for yourself. There are a lot of high jinxes and a Three Stooges fight, but it's the sense of community that warms your heart.  While Emily's neighbors gripe at each other, they stand together for this little girl and her big dog.  Your children will love the story, but adults may get too focused on the choppy graphics.  Just remind yourself that this movie is for children, so it tells a story and doesn't try to be a cinematic marvel.  With that, the film is enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Ruby and Gretia stand in line to sign up for electives.  When Ruby hears her crush, Miles, signing up for choir, she does too.  On the first day of practice, Mr. Bernardo has each of the kids sing to sort them into their respective ranges.  When Ruby has her turn, she runs out of class.  When she goes home, she sees her parents, Jackie and Frank, arguing about money. The next day, Ruby summons the courage to sing for Mr. Bernardo.  He believes she has a unique talent that requires nurturing.  And with guidance, she could use her voice to get into Berklee College of Music. When Ruby comes home to tell Jackie, Ruby gets an unexpected response.<br/><br/>Jackie believes Ruby joined the choir as a sign of teenage rebellion against Jackie, Frank, and Ruby's brother, Leo.  Ruby is a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults, and is the only hearing-abled person in her family. When she works on the fishing boat with Leo and Frank, she fishes and interprets radio calls.  She has translated for them since she was a young child, and they enormously depend on her to help them communicate with other fisherpeople, the townspeople, fish auctioneers, and doctors. When Ruby and Leo feel like the auctioneers cheat them, Leo tries to persuade Frank to start a co-op, but he won't do it. But as the government steps in, it's too much for Frank to take and afford.  He decides to start the co-op with his family.  As the family needs her more than ever, can Ruby fulfill her singing dreams without destroying the family's new business?<br/><br/>This coming-of-age film is unlike any other because Ruby dealt with adult issues long before she was a teenager.  Leo, the eldest sibling, feels like their parents treat him like a baby because he can't hear.  Jackie and Frank need her because they can't afford an interpreter.  Ruby is a teenager that wants to shake off the adult responsibilities she deals with every day. Watching Ruby and her family grow will bring a tear to your eye and make you want to learn how to sign.  It will move you as Ruby shows her pride for her family while singing 'Both Sides, Now.'  A poignant song for the turning point in this film and Ruby's family.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Four years after COVID-19, COVID-23 is airborne, affects the brain, and causes rapid death.  Anyone without an immunity bracelet must stay inside at all times and do a 9 a.m. health scan with their phone.  If they fail the scan, the sanitation department comes to their door with armed guards and escorts them to the Q Zone, also known as the quick death zone.  Some would consider Nico one of the lucky few because he has an immunity bracelet. During the worldwide lockdown, he met Sara. Sara lives with her grandmother and sees people pulled away by Emmett and the sanitation department all the time. On the other side of town, Piper and William raise their daughter, Emma.  While they are immuned, Emma has a weak immune system and could get sick with ease. To make money, Piper and William sell black market immunity bracelets to powerful and wealthy people.  As Piper takes every precaution, William leaves in a suit and breathing mask to meet his mistress, May.  May sings online under the handle MayDay, and people watch and donate money. Their intertwined lives will come to a deadly end when someone gets sick and fails a health check.  They will need an immunity bracelet or die in the Q Zone.<br/><br/>While setting the current pandemic four years in the future, this movie is a mix between Crash and Mission Impossible.  This movie does cover a lot of topics like immuned people passing a disease, disease mutation, and proper quarantine techniques. However, at the core of this movie are three love stories and one obsession story.  The pandemic causes and affects each of these stories.  Seeing the satisfyingly bloody end will entice you to keep watching.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
