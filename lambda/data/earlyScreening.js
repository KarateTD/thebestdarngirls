    "review": "The Retribution Through the Arts, also called RTA, finishes its production of Midsummer. John 'Divine G' Whitfield, a member of the RTA steering committee, meets with the other actors to discuss adding another member to the group. They ponder a few possibilities and choose Clarence 'Divine Eye' Maclin. G thinks Eye will make a great actor and persuades Eye to give the RTA a chance.<br/><br/>Eye sits for the first RTA meeting as the group discusses what play to do next. G has been working on a play called Fineprint. He gives everyone a synopsis. They like it, but Eye wants something different. Eye thinks their plays are too serious, and the people need to laugh, especially in Sing Sing Maximum Security Penitentiary. He proposes they try a comedy. G asks their director, Brent, to give it a shot. They want a Western, Roman, and Egyptian comedy with time traveling and Freddy Kruger. The group laughs, and Brent exits with their ideas.<br/><br/>Brent gives the group a script called Breaking the Mummy's Code with all their requests. Each member reads the script and auditions for the role that speaks to them. Eye informs G that he is auditioning for Hamlet and gets the part after nailing the performance.<br/><br/>The group meets after Brent assigns roles and completes a few acting exercises. G can feel Eye's apprehension and pulls Eye aside. G points out the shiv in Eye's waistband. G demands Eye never bring it to class because a violent act could shut down the program. G has a clemency hearing, while Eye has an appointment with the parole board. These men must lean on each other and the group to put on a stellar performance while their freedom hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Based on Sing Sing Follies by John H. Richardson, the movie opens with a cast under bright theater lights. Then, the correction officers enter to take the actors to their cell. The juxtaposition is startling. The RTA allows the group to discuss their feelings, hardships, and dreams in a safe environment. An excellent writing choice was to introduce the characters before their crimes. It allows the audience to see them as humans first. Viewers see parts of the play during a dress rehearsal, and it doesn't disappoint. If you expect a gritty, violent movie about prison life, this isn't your film. This film is a charming piece about a program that gives men a voice for their emotions and returns their humanity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Fly Me to the Moon",
    "review": "NASA Launch Director Cole Davis averts disaster after finding a liquid nitrogen leak. He gives his scientist a new protocol and grumbles to his deputy, Henry, about their funding. If America wants to win the Space Race, NASA needs funding.<br/><br/>Marketing Specialist Kelly Jones and her assistant, Ruby, regroup after winning the Ford account with a great story and fake baby bump. A man, Moe, sits beside her and applauds her for landing the campaign but tells her she lost it. Earlier, he alerted the Ford executives that she wasn't pregnant. Moe has another job for Kelly because she is the best in the business. He asks Kelly to sell the moon to the American people. If they get support, the government will increase their funding. So she obliges, but only if Ruby can come.<br/><br/>Kelly and Cole meet for the first time at a local diner. Kelly offers to drink with Cole, but he runs before she sidetracks him. Kelly tours the NASA site in the morning and sees Cole with his scientists. She jokes about stalking Cole but quickly informs Cole of Moe's plan. Cole leaves with a huff. She lined up deals with Omega, Crest, Tang, and Fruit of the Loom to sell the moon. If Cole doesn't participate, she will hire people to do it. Cole calls Moe to fire Kelly, but Moe refuses because her tactics work.<br/><br/>Kelly and Cole spend time together, and she tells him about her idea. She wants to broadcast the landing by mounting a camera on Apollo 11. Cole says no, but Moe loves the idea. Later, Moe meets Kelly in her motel room. Moe is unsure if the camera will work in space. So Moe wants Kelly to film a secret moon landing without Cole's knowledge. If Kelly doesn't, Moe will expose her. Can Kelly sell the fake landing to Cole and the world?<br/><br/>This movie leans into the conspiracy while being delightful. Cole is an honest man with a heavy heart. Kelly is a woman with a plan. They grow and learn while working together. And the costumes, hair, and makeup flow perfectly with the 1969 setting. Viewers must remember this isn't a documentary, although the editors use archival footage to set the tone. The dialog is charming, quick, and funny. The film uses the landing as a nail-biting moment but not in the historical sense. It brings this movie to the perfect conclusion that will satisfy believers and skeptics.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Bikeriders",
    "review": "Danny Lyon sat with Kathy in 1965 and interviewed her for his photobook about the Vandals outlaw biker gang. Kathy talks about love, the wives and girlfriends, and the changes in the group. Then, Danny asks Kathy about the day she met Benny. Kathy takes a long pull from her cigarette and recalls that night. Her friend didn't have enough money for her bar tab, so she asked Kathy to bring some. Kathy walked inside, wearing white jeans and a purple cardigan, instantly feeling out of place. After a few Vandals made passes at Kathy, she got up to leave and saw Benny. Benny is taciturn, so Kathy flees for the door. She sees Benny get on his bike and jumps on the back. Five weeks later, Benny and Kathy got married.<br/><br/>Then, Danny asks Kathy about Benny's club, the Vandals. Kathy sighs and explains the gang started as a riding club. After watching The Wild One, the leader, Johnny, wants to change it into a motorcycle club. Cal was Johnny's 2nd in command, but Johnny noticed something special in Benny. Kathy believes Johnny is jealous of Benny's carefree attitude towards life. When Benny gets injured after a fight, Johnny asks Benny to a club picnic, risking Benny's health. Kathy storms into the club and demands that Johnny tell Benny not to come. However, Johnny refuses. Johnny and Kathy fight for Benny. Who will Benny choose?<br/><br/>Inspired by The Bikeriders by Danny Lyon, this movie presents itself as Goodfellas with motorcycles. But it's not. The film doesn't delve into the underbelly of the club's illegal activities because those didn't start until after the old guard left. Instead, the plot is about two people fighting over someone. Kathy wants Benny to be safe, but Johnny desires Benny's freedom within the club. Also, the backing track follows Kathy's emotions instead of the hard-nosed club. This movie isn't the crime thriller you expect but is a power struggle between Kathy and Johnny.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Thelma",
    "review": "Thelma spends quality time with her grandson, Daniel. He gives her lessons about checking email before leaving. Then, Daniel pleads with Thelma to wear her monitor so he knows when she falls.<br/><br/>Thelma goes through her day when she gets a phone call from an unknown number. It's Daniel saying he is in jail for hitting a pregnant woman with his car. As Daniel begs for help, the officer beeps in on the other line. Thelma switches over. The officer says Thelma needs to send $10,000 to an address via mail. She attempts to call Daniel, but the call doesn't go through, solidifying her fears. She calls her daughter, Gail, but Gail's phone is on silent while she works with patients. Next, Thelma tries to connect to her son-in-law, Alan, but he doesn't pick up either. Thelma runs to the mailbox and drops the money inside.<br/><br/>After several tries, Daniel finally picks up. He's not in jail but asleep. The call was a scam.

Later, Thelma wakes up and decides to get her money back. Thelma will prove she can live alone. She will need a scooter, gun, and friend.<br/><br/>Thelma is a grandma on a mission, a Mission: Impossible. As the audience watches Thelma hijack a scooter, stake out a post office box, and start an explosion, you believe she's doing it for money. However, it's to keep her independence. Thelma insists on retrieving the money alone, but it becomes selfishness. Her friend, Ben, calls Thelma out on her behavior but won't give up on her. Your heart will ache during Thelma's lows, but you will have a hearty laugh during her highs. This film is for comedy and action fans with tenderness. You won't desire to buy it but it's worth seeing on the big screen. And don't leave before the mid-credit scene.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
