    "review":"Nathan Caine is the assistant manager at San Diego Trust Bank. He prepares coffee over ice after helping his client, Earl, keep his store. Nate's crush, teller Sherry, says hello to Nate and scares him, causing Nate to spill scalding coffee on his hand. Sherry offers to buy Nate lunch. Nate says no until he thinks about Earl. Earl said time with his wife was priceless. Nate runs into the hallway and accepts Sherry's offer.<br/><br/>Sherry orders cherry pie while Nate gets a milkshake. She attempts to feed Nate pie, but he staunchly refuses. Nate doesn't eat solid foods because he has a genetic disorder called congenital insensitivity to pain. She thinks Nate has a superpower, but Nate explains that he could severely bite his tongue and never know it. Now, Nate takes every precaution to protect himself from accidents and infection. Sherry promises to care for him and convinces him to eat pie. Nate loves it, and she asks him out.<br/><br/>Nate meets Sherry at the bar, and she talks about her upbringing and being in recovery. Then, Nate's high school bully approaches with a punch and calls Nate Novocaine. Nate leaves for the bathroom and returns to see Sherry flirting with his bully. Sherry tells them to let the past go and celebrate with a drink. The bully and Nate take the shot, but the bully chokes. The shot was ghost pepper hot sauce. Nate and Sherry run out of the bar and to his home. They spend the night together.<br/><br/>Nate wakes with a new lease on life on Christmas Eve. Then, three bank robbers - Ben, André, and Simon - enter the bank dressed as Santa and order everyone on the ground. They grab Nate, but Nate stammers with fear as they hit him. Sherry begs the robbers to stop. They sadistically point the gun at Sherry, and Nate says the combination. The robbers grab the money, knock out Nate, and take Sherry as a hostage. Nate regains consciousness and runs outside. He saves a cop from exsanguination before stealing the cop's gun and car. He will risk it all to save Sherry and be her superhero. However, detectives Mincy and Coltraine believe Nate is working with the robbers. Can Nate save Sherry before the police arrest him?<br/><br/>Viewers should note that the movie states the seriousness of this rare condition after the credits. The film doesn't want to make light of a complex situation while using it for a plot point. This high-octane picture is similar to Crank. The film relies heavily on dark humor and grotesque violence to engage the audience, but it's fun. Viewers can figure out the twist, but the film offers more for the ending. Nate's condition separates this movie from others in its genre. Otherwise, this film is a mindless good time for anyone who loves action, dark humor, and gore and could grow into a franchise with the correct script.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Paddington in Peru",
    "review": "Paddington celebrates becoming a British citizen and can travel the world with his new passport. While Paddington's life has changed, so has the Brown's. Judy Brown applies to university while her mother, Mary, cries over Judy leaving the nest. Jonathan Brown invents ways to make chilling easier while gaming, and his dad, Henry, creates new risk manuals to impress his American boss, Madison. During the meeting, Madison wants Henry to embrace risk.<br/><br/>Paddington writes to his Aunt Lucy at the Home for Retired Bears. She rescued him in the Peruvian Amazon years ago and cared for him until he arrived in London. Then, he receives a letter from Reverend Mother at the home. She states that Lucy is sad and only speaks of him. She worries Lucy's condition will worsen and advises Paddington to visit.<br/><br/>Paddington tells the Browns he wants to go to Peru. Mary thinks this will entice much-needed family time before Judy leaves. And Henry believes this calculated risk will impress Madison. The Browns pack up and travel to Peru.<br/><br/>Paddington runs to Aunt Lucy's cabin when they arrive at the retirement home. Sadly, Reverend Mother reports that Aunt Lucy is missing. He searches her room and stumbles upon a map with an X over the Rumi Rocks. The Browns refuse to let Paddington travel alone and volunteer to go with him.<br/><br/>Paddington and the Browns consider ways to travel through the jungle. Then, a man on a boat floats downstream. He introduces himself, Captain Hunter, and his daughter, Skipper Gina. He knows the Rumi Rocks because of the myth. Many believe the rocks are the doorway to El Dorado, the lost city of gold. The Browns travel to find Aunt Lucy, but others have ill intentions.<br/><br/>Based on the heartwarming series, this movie is an adventurous comedy for the whole family. The graphics are seamless and keep the viewer grounded in the Paddington world. The actors gave a stellar performance while acting with the stand-in. The script doesn't rely on sneaky adult jokes or toilet humor for a laugh. This movie focuses on two morals: what do you treasure and where do you belong. This adventure answers those questions beautifully and lovingly with several twists and turns. You don't need to see the first two films to enjoy this beautiful installment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

She invites Mary-Anne, Jodie, and their producer, Eddie.<br/><br/>Everyone enjoys Shelly's cooking until Eddie drops by with sad news. He heard they are ending The Razzle Dazzle show.

The actors did an amazing job of highlighting these performers and the pitfalls of their work. This movie has an independent film conclusion but will make you think about your career. You won't buy the film, but it's wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Red One",
    "review": "Cal surveys the area while Santa Claus talks to children at the mall. Christmas is in less than 48 hours, and Santa wants to prep with exercise. Mrs. Claus counts his reps and gingerly walks towards the door when Cal enters, holding an envelope. Cal is the Captain of Santa's security team, ELF, but wants to resign. Santa sadly accepts Cal's resignation and asks Cal to stay on until the final run. Cal agrees. He reminisces on a bridge and sees lights flicker in the distance. When the anomaly continues, Cal questions if anyone has eyes on Santa. He runs to Santa's bedroom when no one sees him. Cal sees someone driving away with Santa. Cal chases them but loses Santa.<br/><br/>The director of MORA, Zoe, has a video call to get an update from Cal. Cal informs Zoe that a team broke through the North Pole cloaking device and kidnapped Santa. Agent Garcia checked the dark web and discovered someone stole equipment to test seismic activity. People in the underworld call the person The Wolf. The Wolf's real name is Jack.<br/><br/>They find Jack in his apartment, but he fights back. Zoe stuns Jack and ties him to a chair. She orders her soldiers to box Jack up and take him to the North Pole. Zoe will double Jack's fee if he tracks the client. Jack accepts.<br/><br/>Cal and Jack locate the client, Tim, a mercenary. Tim is too afraid to say the name and writes it in the sand. Jack reads the name Grýla out loud, and Grýla hears it. She possesses Tim's body to deliver a warning. Grýla believes naughty people don't fear Santa. She wants the world to be kinder. So, Grýla will go through the naughty list and punish anyone listed, no matter the offense. Grýla needs Santa's magic to complete her mission to force the world to be nice or else. Can Cal and Jack stop Grýla in time to save Christmas?<br/><br/>The visual effects are fun, but the humor falls flat. The script describes Jack as a level 4 naughty lister. He is a degenerate gambler with a stealing habit. Also, he's neglecting his son, Dylan. Cal surveys the world and sees angry, mean, and ungrateful adults. He's lost his wonder and doesn't think it will return. Cal and Jack must grow to save Santa, but it becomes boring. This film could be 30 minutes shorter and make the same point.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
