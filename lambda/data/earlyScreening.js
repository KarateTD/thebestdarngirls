    "mtitle":"Don't Worry Darling",
    "review":"Alice and Jack reside in a town called Victory, created by Frank and assisted by a psychologist, Dr. Collins. Every day the city's men leave to work on the Victory Project. In ballet practice, Alice shares her concerns with the other wives, Bunny and Peg. And Shelley, Frank's wife, introduces a new wife, Violet, to the students.<br/><br/>Jack comes home with some fantastic news. Frank invited them over to his home for a party. After Shelley introduces Jack, Margaret starts to babble about 'everything being a lie.' Margaret's husband pulls her away. Alice can't find Jack after Frank's speech and looks for him. She sees Margaret's husband trying to make Margaret take a pill, but Margaret refuses.<br/><br/>During a shopping trip, Bunny tells everyone that Margaret walked past the city limits with her son after seeing something. Margaret came back without her son. While everyone says the boy died, Margaret says they took her son from her to punish her. Bunny tells the wives that Margaret should've stayed in Victory, where it was safe.<br/><br/>Instead of shopping again, Alice decides to stay on the bus and ride. She looks at the sky and sees a plane crash into the mountains. Alice gets off and walks into the desert, up to the peak. She discovers the Victory headquarters at the top. She touches the glass window and wakes up in bed. She has no idea how she got home or when.<br/><br/>Later, Alice gets a call from Margaret saying they saw the same thing and begging to leave together. Alice goes through her yard and sees Margaret standing on the roof. Margaret slits her throat and falls off the house. Alice tries to run to her, but two men in red jumpsuits pull Alice away. When Jack comes home, Alice tries to explain, but he says Margaret is fine and has a few stitches. Alice knows that's a lie and blames herself for disregarding Margaret. Alice will stop at nothing to find out what's happening with the Victory Project.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an innocent 1950s party with happy housewives and working husbands. After the women cook breakfast, their husbands leave the cul-de-sac simultaneously. This community feels straight out of Stepford. However, something feels darker as the women clean the home while listening to Frank on the radio and watching him on TV. Now it feels like a cult brainwashing tactic. The audience needs to understand that this movie builds up but leaves you with more questions than answers. You are left to draw your own conclusions about the characters and their future. Alice and Jack's core problem is their relationship. And it leads them to Victory.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
