  "mtitle":"Are You There God? It's Me Margaret",
  "review":"Eleven-year-old Margaret Simon returns from summer camp to the open arms of her mother, Barbara, and grandmother, Sylvia. Margaret notices boxes sprawled across her parents' New York apartment. Sylvia blurts out the truth. Margaret and her family are moving to New Jersey. Margaret's dad, Herb, got a promotion. Barbara will be home more and help at PTA meetings like all the other moms. Margaret sighs and prepares for New Jersey by praying to God.<br/><br/>As the Simons move into their new home, a young girl, Nancy, knocks on the door. She invites Margaret to run through the sprinklers outside her home. Margaret can't find her bathing suit, so Nancy offers to let Margaret borrow one of hers. Nancy brings Margaret to her house to change and notices that Margaret hasn't started wearing a bra yet. Nancy tells Margaret to come to school without socks to meet her friends.<br/><br/>With her Achilles tendons covered in blisters, Margaret walks into her class and sits with Nancy and Nancy's friends, Gretchen and Janine. Nancy invites Margaret to their secret meeting after school, and Margaret is ecstatic. Nancy, Janine, Margaret, and Gretchen sit at a tea party and discuss the club's rules. First, everyone must wear a bra. Second, they have to tell the group when they get their period. Third, they have to keep a boy book with the name of the boys they like. Finally, they have to share the boys' names. They all agree to the terms.<br/><br/>Margaret begs Barbara to take her bra shopping and wears it to the first meeting. Nancy says they will get their period soon because they are wearing bras. Margaret runs home, gets on her knees, and prays to God to get her period. Margaret's year of womanhood will bring family strife, religious insecurities, and two minutes in heaven.<br/><br/>Based on Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret by Judy Blume, this movie makes a confusing time funny, heartfelt, and charming. Margaret's womanhood isn't her only struggle. She grows up in an interfaith family without religion because her maternal grandparents disowned Barbara for marrying a Jewish man. Margaret doesn't know what she believes but prays with joy, love, and frustration. Margaret learns about frienemies, bullying, and cute jerks within a year. If you haven't read the book, this movie will have you running for a copy. If you have read the book, this movie was long overdue and worth the wait.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",
    "review":"Edgin and Holga ask the parole board when Jonathan will come. They got arrested for grand theft and other crimes. Edgin stands before them and explains his position in life. He started with the Harpers. They were a group of spies who collected information but never stole anything. After years with the Harpers, Edgin gained enemies, including the Red Wizards. A Red Wizard killed his wife with a Red Wizard's blade. But not before she hid their daughter, Kira, from them.<br/><br/>Holga became an outcast after falling in love with an outsider. She took pity on Kira and helped Edgin raise the girl. Holga assisted Edgin's change from spy to a thief, and Edgin enjoyed the spoils with Kira by his side. During their crime spree, they met a young and inexperienced sorcerer, Simon. Later, they add Forge, a con man, to their fold. Forge met a woman named Sofina. Sofina heard about a massive treasure containing the Tablet of Resurrection. It can bring anyone back from the dead, including people killed with a Red Wizard's Blade.<br/><br/>They have a successful heist until Sofina hurts one of the guards. She releases a time spell, but Simon and Forge escape. Edgin begs Forge to take care of Kira before freezing in place. Now, they are pleading for parole. Jonathan walks into the room, and Holga and Edgin jump on him and push them out of the window. Jonathan spreads his wings and flies to avoid death. Holga and Edgin are free and head to Kira and Forge.<br/><br/>Forge conned his way to Lord of Neverwinter. Edgin and Holga are happy Forge is in a commanding position, but Edgin is there for Kira and the tablet. Forge will not return either and introduces them to his advisor, Sofina. Sofina tells her guards to kill Edgin and Holga.<br/><br/>Edgin and Holga defeat the executioner and find Simon performing a magic show while robbing his audience. They convince him to rejoin their team to rob Forge of his tablet, treasures, and Kira. But Simon thinks they should add Doric, a tiefling druid. Doric shapeshifts into a bug and flies into Forge's fortress. Doric finds Forge's vault, but Sofina enchants the vault with an impenetrable field. Simon knows of a relic that can undo Sofina's spell but doesn't know where to find it. The team goes on a quest and discovers Xenk has the item. They must find Xenk, get the relic, take down the enchantment, and get Kira and the tablet. Then, they will get revenge against Forge and Sofina and resurrect Edgin's wife.<br/><br/>Like the game, this movie has quests, magic, and humor. The jokes, like the CGI, are clean. So the whole family can enjoy this movie. You don't have to know anything about the game to see the film. Watch this movie on the big screen because the graphics are stellar. Each main character got an enriched backstory that flowed nicely with the plot. And there were zero fluff scenes. The fight scenes were elegant in tight spaces and explosive in open areas. Be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene. It's worth the wait.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Creed III",
    "review":"Adonis Creed steps in the ropes for the last time against Pretty Ricky Conlan in South Africa to defend his heavyweight title. And Adonis wins and retires. Now, Adonis focuses on being a husband to Bianca, father to Amara, and promoter for Duke's fighters. Three years later, Felix Chavez, a Duke boxer, is the undisputed heavyweight champion. Felix is an extraordinary boxer but keeps knocking out his sparring partners. No one wants to help Felix train for his next fight. But he needs it because Adonis booked Felix versus Drago for the championship. Adonis leaves the gym to find a man leaning on his car. Adonis recognizes the man, Damian, from his past. In 2002, Adonis snuck out of the house to hold Damian's gear while Damian boxed in underground fights. Adonis and Damian lost touch when Damian went to jail for 18 years.<br/><br/>Adonis and Damian laugh about the past, and Adonis apologizes for not connecting sooner. Damian wants an opportunity to get back in the ring and fight for the title. Adonis tells Damian to come to the gym and start at the bottom. During a sparring match, Damian attacks Felix and Duke kicks Damian and Adonis out of the gym. He tells Adonis that Damian is a problem because he only wants to hurt people.<br/><br/>Damian comes to Adonis's home later and meets Bianca and Amara. Damian asks Adonis to give him a match with Felix, but Adonis says no. Instead, Adonis invites Damian to a listening party for one of Bianca's artists. Drago and Felix attend, so Adonis uses this opportunity to network and entice more sponsors. Then, someone attacks Drago with a pipe, breaking Drago's arm and hand. Adonis knows Drago won't heal in time and wants to put Damian in Drago's place. Duke rejects it, but Felix says yes. After an unforeseen double cross, Adonis will come out of retirement, get back in the ring, and set the past straight.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut is a cinematic smash. The first sports movie filmed with an IMAX camera brings every punch, dab, and dirty blow into crystal clear view. In the opening sequence, the tracking shot follows Adonis's point of view as he looks around the underground boxing venue. Then, the audience sees Adonis retire to become a businessman and family man. While Rocky isn't in this movie, his training and words of wisdom make a comeback. The final fight scene will stay with you because the crowd melts away. It's just the ring, the boxers, and their demons. This third installment is a pure Creed movie and a welcome and well-needed addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Magic Mike's Last Dance",
    "review":"Mike lost his furniture business during the pandemic and stopped dancing. Now, he works as a bartender at private parties. Mike's latest job is at a charity pool party thrown by Maxandra Mendoza, formerly Rattigan. Kim, a former client, remembers Mike as he serves her a drink and tells Max about him. Max calls Mike into her home and asks how much for a dance. As a joke, Mike says $60,000. She calls his dance silly and offers $6,000 instead. To prove his dance isn't a joke, Mike pours Max a drink, rearranges the furniture, and gives her the wildest dance of her dreams. She tells him to come to London on her private plane but won't tell him why. She will pay him the $60,000 he quoted earlier if he does.<br/><br/>After a shopping trip, Max brings Mike to The Rattigan Theater. The theater's running play is Isabel Ascendant, but Max hates it because it gives an overused premise: will a woman choose love or money? Max announces the play is on hiatus for four weeks while she creates a new show with her new director, Mike. She wants something new and revolutionary.<br/><br/>As Mike and Max iron out the details, Zadie, Max's daughter, curtly walks up to them. Zadie rolls her eyes and tells Mike that Max's therapist described Max as the 'Queen of the 1st Act.' She has big ideas and loves to start them but never finishes them. Later Mike uncovers that Max is under the thumb of her soon-to-be ex-husband, Roger. He bought the theater for her when they married. She must stay on Roger's good side to keep it. Mike will direct his first play with an exotic show under Max while staying in Roger's good graces.<br/><br/>The third installment of the franchise makes fun of the factitious play while being the play. Like Isabel, Max has to decide between her estranged husband, Roger, or Mike. So, labeling the play as shallow and sexist but having the movie follow the same plot is contradicting. The final dance is entertaining, and the sexy dancers are immensely talented. And there is a sweet 10-second intermission and a cameo from your favorites. If you enjoyed the first two, see this one at the matinee price on a regular screen with simple surround sound. Anything else is a waste.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
