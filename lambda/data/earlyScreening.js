    "review":"Newt finds a Qilin about to give birth.  In the magical world, the Qilin can see into someone's soul, and they use it to pick their next leader.  After the creature gives birth, Credence attacks Newt, kills the mother Qilin, and steals the newborn calf.  When Newt wakes up, he realizes that the Qilin gave birth to twins.  He vows to keep this one safe until the Supreme Mugwump election.<br/><br/>At Grindelwald's fortress, he delights in Credence's find and praises Credence.  Queenie stands in the doorway and watches in horror as Grindelwald slits the baby Qilin's throat.  He looks into the pool of blood and sees into the future.  He gathers his allies and heads to Germany.<br/><br/>Dumbledore requested that Newt bring Theseus to him because he needs to explain something to Theseus.  Dumbledore tells Newt and Theseus that Grindelwald wants to make a power play and take over the magical world.  Dumbledore can't fight Grindelwald because they made a blood pact years ago.  Newt asks Professor Eulalie HIcks to find Jacob and bring Jacob to their train.<br/><br/>On the train, Newt lays out Dumbledore's plan.  Dumbledore knows Grindelwald can see into the future.  So Dumbledore wants to confuse Grindelwald by creating multiple ploys to bewilder Grindelwald's visions.  Each member of the team has a different mission and proceeds to Germany.<br/><br/>In Germany, the magical world prepares to vote for its next leader.  However, the Supreme Head of the International Confederation of Wizards, Anton Vogel, has an announcement.  He decided to clear Grindelwald of all charges, stating a lack of evidence.  Grindelwald can roam the world as a free man.  But that's not enough, and Dumbledore knows it.  Dumbledore will need Newt and his friends to stop Grindelwald's climb to power.<br/><br/>The third installment of The Fantastic Series doesn't offer fans new magic.  However, this film has more drama than a daytime soap opera and new beasts.  And if you haven't seen the first two films, don't worry.  Eulalie gives a 30-second synopsis of Jacob and Queenie's relationship that explains the first two plots.  And be prepared for the scariest and funniest prison break of the year.  And yes, you will get plenty of scenes with Niffler and Pickett.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2",
    "review":"On the Mushroom Planet, Dr. Robotnik created a device with Sonic's quill to open a portal.  The portal knocks Robotnik to the ground, and aliens come through.  Before he can enter, a red Echidna warrior named Knuckles stops him.  Knuckles sees the quill and wants to know where Robotnik obtained it.  Robotnik tells Knuckles that Sonic is on Earth, and he will show Knuckles the way.<br/><br/>On Earth, Sonic wants to be the hero.  Tom tells Sonic that being responsible makes you a hero.  So they decide to give Sonic some responsibility.  While Tom and Maddie go to Hawaii for Rachel's wedding, they will leave Sonic home alone for 48 hours.<br/><br/>Sonic makes the most of his time alone but gets scared when the lights flicker.  Instead of an unprofessional pizza man, Robotnik kicks down the door.  Before Sonic lays a punch, Robotnik steps out of the way, and Knuckles lets Sonic know who is in charge.  During their battle, a cop car pulls next to Sonic.  It's Tails driving.  He believes Sonic is the key to finding the ultimate power.  It's an emerald that allows someone's thoughts to become real.  Robotnik wants the emerald, and he plans to use Knuckles to find it.  But Knuckles needs it to exact his revenge on Sonic and Longclaw.<br/><br/>Tails and Sonic look at the map Longclaw gave him.  Longclaw protected the emerald and chose Sonic to take the mantle after dying.  Sonic gladly takes the mission to find and guard the emerald.  Tails and Sonic must save the world from Robotnik and Knuckles, and they must do it before Maddie and Tom come home from Hawaii.  It will take one goat's milk latte, a dance battle, an avalanche, and a catfish to finish the mission.<br/><br/>Based on the video game, Sonic the Hedgehog and the movie of the same name, this film surpasses its prequel.  Adults and children will laugh and dance to these lovable characters that span generations.  The computer animators allowed Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to look less realistic while not making the non-CGI characters and action look too cartoonish.  This balance lets viewers stay focused on the movie and the storyline.  Stay past the first set of credits to get a glimpse at Sonic 3.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent",
    "review":"Nicolas Cage desperately auditioned for a role because he believed it was a once-in-a-lifetime part.  And he needs the money.  His agent, Richard Fink, got a call from Nick's accountant.  Nick owes his hotel $600,000. While Nick didn't get the part, Fink has an offer for Nick.  A billionaire wants Nick to come to his birthday party for $1 million.  Nick says no and goes to therapy with his daughter, Abby.  Nick drops off Abby at the home of his ex-wife, Olivia.  Olivia reminds Nick that Abby's Sweet 16 party is tonight.  Nick promises to make it and heads back to his hotel; only his keycard doesn't work.  Feeling at his lowest, Nick calls Fink and says yes to Javi Gutierrez's birthday party.<br/><br/>When Nick lands in Mallorca, a fan, Vivian, approaches him for a picture.  But she has another motive.  Vivian is a CIA agent investigating Javi.  She and her partner, Martin, think Javi is a drug lord who kidnapped the daughter, Maria, of a president to make the president drop out of the election.  So, they must save Maria by putting a tracker in Nick's pocket.<br/><br/>At Javi's compound, Javi welcomes Nick with open arms. Javi sent his screenplay to Fink because he wants Nick to star in it.  After Javi works up the nerve to ask, Nick gives Javi disappointing information: Nick is retiring from acting.  Vivian and Martin grab Nick off the street and give Nick details about Javi.  They need Nick to stay at Javi's and look for Maria.  So, Nick tells Javi he will help Javi write a new screenplay to give Nick the time he needs to find Maria.  When Javi discovers Nick's intentions, will Nick be able to use his acting skills to get out of the situation?<br/><br/>This buddy-comedy movie allows Nick to laugh at himself and the movie's wild plot.  At certain moments, the conversation is so in-line with the action that you feel like Nick and Javi are narrating it.  One thing for sure: Nick gets the joke.  It allows viewers to see fandom at its best and worst.  This movie is a guaranteed laugh, but it doesn't spark an interest to buy.  But don't be surprised if you have a newfound respect for Nicolas Cage, Face-Off, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and Paddington 2.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story",
    "review":"Kurt Warner watched Super Bowl 19, and Joe Montana inspired him to play.  With the odds stacked against him, Kurt joined the University of Northern Iowa football team.  He wants to make a highlight reel for agents and the NFL draft.  So, Kurt asks Coach Allen to give him a chance.  After a grueling practice, Kurt gets to start and make enough plays for his reel.<br/><br/>One night, Mike Hudnutt invites Kurt to go line dancing.  He sees a beautiful woman on the dance floor, and she gives him a look.  The next day, Kurt begs Mike to teach him how to dance.  Later, Kurt asks the woman for a dance.  Before their final dance, she tells Kurt that she's Brenda and leaves.  Brenda tells Kurt it won't work because she is a divorced mom with two kids.  To Brenda's surprise, Kurt shows up at her door the next day with a rose.  Her oldest son, Zack, lets Kurt into the house, and they bond instantly.<br/><br/>After a successful string of games, Kurt finds an agent and waits on the NFL draft picks.  Though the NFL didn't draft him, the Green Bay Packers hired him with a $5,000 signing bonus.  After two days, the Packers cut him.  Jim Foster sits at their table and offers Kurt a position with the Arena Football League during a rare date night for Kurt and Brenda.  Kurt laughs and calls it a place for players going down the drain.  Kurt doesn't plan on joining unless heck freezes over.  Well, Kurt will get his wish and his first step into the NFL.<br/><br/>Based on All Things Possible: My Story of Faith, Football, and the First Miracle Season by Kurt Warner, this movie proves perseverance wins overall.  As the film begins, viewers get the stats of high school players moving to college and then to the NFL.  Hearing these stats allows you to understand the odds Kurt faced on his way to becoming MVP in Super Bowl 34.  From learning how to dance, risking life and limb for his family, and staying in the pocket, Kurt's difficult moments prepared him for the next step in life and the game.  But, it's what Kurt does off the field that gives him joy.  His work with Treasure House brings him and Brenda more pride than his football career.  Also, the film does a great job of blending old footage with today's filming.  While the story is encouraging and gives you a sense of faith, you won't have an urge to buy or watch again.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Clifford the Big Red Dog",
    "review":"Emily feels like the odd girl out because she is a scholarship student at an elite private school.  While her mother, Maggie, wants to help, Emily decides to deal with it on her terms.  Maggie has to go out of town for work, and much to Emily's chagrin, her uncle Casey is the only available babysitter.  As Casey walks Emily to school, Emily sees Mr. Bridwell's Animal Rescue tent at school.  Mr. Bridwell takes them to an empty part of the tent and directs Emily to go up the stairs.  Up there, Emily finds a bright red dog.  Emily questions Mr. Bridwell about the dog.  Mr. Bridwell says that someone abandoned the dog, and it will grow to the size of the love in her heart.  However, they leave the dog behind.  As she lays on the bed, Emily sees her bookbag move.  Emily opens the bookbag to find the red dog inside.  She names the dog Clifford and attempts to hide it from Casey.  The plan fails in an instant when Clifford steals Casey's lunch.<br/><br/>He lets Emily have Clifford for the night, but they will return the dog in the morning.  Casey wants to return the large dog to Mr. Bridwell, but they can't find him on the internet.  So they decide to take Clifford to the vet instead.  A few of the neighbors film Clifford, and it goes viral.  The video catches the attention of Life Grow's CEO, Zack Tieran.  His company spent $400 million attempting to reduce hunger by creating genetically-engineered enormous food.  He thinks Clifford will be the key, and nothing will stop Zack from getting the big red dog.<br/><br/>Based on Clifford the Big Red Dog by Norman Bridwell, this movie teaches as it entertains.  And Emily learns two lessons.  First, being unique is good.  Second, you must speak up for yourself.  There are a lot of high jinxes and a Three Stooges fight, but it's the sense of community that warms your heart.  While Emily's neighbors gripe at each other, they stand together for this little girl and her big dog.  Your children will love the story, but adults may get too focused on the choppy graphics.  Just remind yourself that this movie is for children, so it tells a story and doesn't try to be a cinematic marvel.  With that, the film is enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
