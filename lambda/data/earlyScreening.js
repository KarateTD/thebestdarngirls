    "mtitle": "The Life of Chuck",
    "review": "Marty has a young man read Walt Whitman's Songs of Myself to the class, but no one pays attention because a part of California sank into the ocean after a 9.1 earthquake. Marty calls his ex-wife, nurse Felicia. Over the past few days, Marty has noticed signs around town thanking Chuck Krantz for his 39 years of service. Felicia heard Chuck's commercial on the radio. Neither of them knows who this man is or what he means to the town. Marty and Felicia discuss the cosmic calendar as they wait for the world's inevitable doom.<br/><br/>Taylor left Juilliard and now works in a record store. She plays drums on the street for spare change. One day, she sees Chuck walking down the street. She matches the beat to his stride. Chuck puts down his briefcase and starts to groove. After a profitable show, Taylor questions why Chuck stopped. He doesn't have an answer.<br/><br/>Chuck moved in with his grandparents after his parents and unborn sister died in a car crash. Three years later, Chuck's grandmother starts cooking again. She loves dancing to rock and roll while cooking. One day, she asks Chuck to join her. Chuck's grandparents have one rule: stay out of the conical. However, Chuck's curiosity gets the better of him, and he tries to open the door. His grandfather yells at Chuck, accidentally pushes Chuck down the steps, freezes in the doorway, grabs his arm, and shuts the door. He apologizes to Chuck and demands that Chuck take heed. Chuck has no idea what life has in store for him and the impact every person will make. It's time to witness Chuck.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by Steven King, this movie won't make sense until the end. The narrator tells the story of Chuck's life in three acts in reverse. In Act 3, the world is slowly falling apart. Pay attention to the poem, commercial, characters' speeches, and TV. The plot will revisit these themes during the first and second acts. Act two is the most lighthearted. Accountant Chuck chooses to enjoy the world around him and dance. Act one is the most honest and will connect the viewers with young Chuck. These formidable years have the most profound impact on Acts 2 and 3. This film is a mystical enigma surrounding an ordinary life. The Life of Chuck shows how beautiful yours can be when you choose to live it to the fullest.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Abel goes through vocal exercises, lifts weights, and throws a few punches before going on stage. His manager, Lee, feeds his ego. Abel performs in front of a sold-out stadium. Later, Lee takes Abel to an otolaryngologist because Abel lost his ability to sing multiple times. The doctor doesn't see nodules and suspects Abel has Muscle Tension Dysphonia. Abel summarizes that his MTD started after his breakup and begs Lee to call his ex-girlfriend. Lee caves and puts the call on speaker. She never picks up.<br/><br/>Abel breaks down backstage and repeatedly calls his ex-girlfriend. Abel tells Lee to cancel his concert as he cries. Lee pumps Abel up with aggressive words of encouragement, reminders of their past, and drugs. Abel steps on stage and performs. However, his voice starts to crack. Abel looks in the crowd, locks eyes with Anima, and runs off stage. Abel packs his backpack and slips out to escape Lee.<br/><br/>Anima exits her house in tears and lights it on fire. She travels to see Abel in concert and watches him falter in front of fans. Out of concern, she jumps the barricade and sneaks backstage. He remembers her from the crowd and invites Anima to spend the evening with him. She says yes. Abel believes this moment is for the night and will continue his tour tomorrow. However, Anima has other plans. She will force him to come to terms with his life, choices, and music. She will make him pay if he doesn't.<br/><br/>Inspired by Hurry Up Tomorrow by The Weeknd, this movie symbolizes The Weeknd's music career and personal life. The film starts in a 4:3 ratio with a long tracking shot. This dynamic gives the audience a feeling of rationality. Opposed to Anima's following scenes with the burning house. The ratio changes to 16:9 with several cuts. Then, the ratio switches when Abel reaches a realization during his torture. Viewers must enter this movie with the understanding that they are entering The Weeknd's mind. Without that understanding, you will spend the entire movie asking for the plot with an urge to buy the album.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Fight or Flight",
    "review": "Agent Aaron Hunter curses as he enters headquarters. Someone slaughtered their team in Bangkok and escaped. They unveiled that the killer was The Ghost, a legendary black hat hacker. Hunter chastises his subordinates as his boss, Agent Katherine Brunt, enters. Before Hunter speaks, a team member discovers altered video footage hiding The Ghost's identity. The Ghost will board a flight to San Francisco. However, they don't have any mercenaries close enough to Bangkok to board a plane to identify and apprehend The Ghost. Brunt dials her only option.<br/><br/>Lucas Reyes stumbles into a bar and asks for another drink. His phone rings, and he immediately hangs up. Brunt calls again and pleads with Lucas to listen. She promises to reinstate him if he completes the mission. Lucas agrees with a few fists and dead bodies.<br/><br/>Before the flight, flight attendant Garrett briefs the team on today's passengers. Flight attendants Isha and Royce share a quip before boarding the passengers. Lucas makes pleasantries with the crew, sits, and updates Brunt in a text.<br/><br/>Agent Kyle Robinson requests to speak privately to Brunt and Hunter at headquarters. They enter a secure office, and Robinson tells them an unfortunate update. Someone alerted the world's most violent criminals that The Ghost was on that plane. The plane is littered with killers hunting the Ghost. They alert Lucas. Can Lucas unmask and apprehend the Ghost before someone kills them?<br/><br/>This movie, like Love Hurts and Novocaine, is funny and action-packed from the beginning to the end. The writers created an unserious action film. The weapons, battles, and alliances are outlandish. The film does have a strong lesson, but the writers didn't wallow in the message. The choreography focused on new fight elements, blood, and drugs to keep the audience engaged. However, the editing is clumsy. The ending invites a potential part two. However, one is enough for this future cult classic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Accountant 2",
    "review": "Former Treasury Director Raymond King meets Ana√Øs in a pub. Ray shows her a picture of a family and points to the boy. Ray tells her that a man, Emiliano, hired him to find his daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, Alberto. He warns her to be careful, but she tells Ray that people are following him. Ray looks around the room and sees several men moving in the shadows. He runs to the bathroom, but the window won't budge. He hides in the stall while writing a message on his arm. He manages to escape the pub, but a sniper shoots him in the street.<br/><br/>Newly appointed Treasury Director Marybeth enters her office at FinCEN and answers the phone. It's the medical examiner's office. A detective on Ray's case asks Marybeth if Ray has financial issues. Marybeth doesn't recall and wonders what caused the detective to question Ray's spending habits. The detective pulls down the sheet covering Ray's body and exposes his arm. He has 'Find the Accountant' scrolled on it.<br/><br/>Marybeth travels to Ray's rented home and finds marks on a blank wall. The owners removed the gruesome photos he displayed. She pays the rent and makes a murder board. She can't decipher the information and finds a business card for Harbor Neuroscience Academy. She calls the number and assumes the British voice, Justine, is eavesdropping. Marybeth informs the receiver that Ray is dead and that she needs the accountant, Christian Wolff.<br/><br/>Christian arrives at Marybeth's location and watches her review the evidence. He uncovered that each murder follows the family in the photo. If they want to discover who killed the victims, they must find the family. However, they will need more boots on the ground because Marybeth refuses to do anything illegal. So, Christian calls his brother Braxton.<br/><br/>Braxton is finishing a job overseas when his phone rings. Christian wants to know if Braxton can be in Los Angeles in 24 hours. They will use their talents to uncover a dark world ruled by greed and find a missing family.<br/><br/>This sequel was worth the wait. It expands the world while allowing Christian Wolff to grow. He and Braxton have a loving bond, but Braxton wants a deeper connection to his big brother. The hand-to-hand combat is perfectly choreographed, framed, and edited. The shootouts are more elaborate and farfetched, but the film is so good you won't care. Also, the audience gets to see what happens at the Academy. It's fun, brilliant, and shocking. This series will be the next John Wick if writing and action rise steadily.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Violet ends her counseling session with her client on a high note. She dresses for her date, Henry, and lets her sister, Jen, inside to watch her son, Toby. Violet changes and drives to Palate Restaurant.<br/><br/>Violet arrives before Henry, who texted that he will be 10 minutes late, and asks the hostess to seat her at the bar. Violet bumps into a man, Connor, and she drops her phone. The bartender, Cara, takes Violet's order while a man, Richard, calls Violet Diane. Violet corrects him, and he flusters. Violet and Richard converse until Phil steps between them. Cara apologizes because Phil is their new piano player. Then, someone airdrops Violet a weird image, warning that she will have the worst date of her life. Violet ignores the images when Henry arrives with his camera bag because he doesn't want to leave it in the car. The hostess takes Henry and Violet to their table.<br/><br/>As their waiter, Matt, introduces himself, Violet gets more airdrops from someone called 'Let's Play.' She tells Henry, and he recalls that you must be within 50 feet to send a drop. He deduces that the prankster has to be in the restaurant. Violet gets a text that tells her to check her home's security camera. She sees a masked man holding a gun in her house. Then, 'Let's Play' warns Violet to keep calm. Violet plays along until the culprit wants her to do the unthinkable: kill Henry. Can Violet find who's 'Let's Play' and save Toby before she has to murder Henry?<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery wrapped in a thriller. The writer has to create suspense within the confines of the restaurant. And using Airdrop technology allows 'Let's Play' to be nearby. Anyone could be 'Let's Play.' The director shoots Violet at an angle where her world slips away anytime the culprit traps her in a corner. It's a visual representation of a trauma response. Moviegoers should sit closer to the screen if they have issues with their eyesight. A subplot is at play, but viewers won't care because the mystery steals their attention. This movie is for fans of Breaking In, Panic Room, or Phone Booth.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
