    "review":"Connor stares at Olivia from the bar. Connor's friend, Greg, warns Connor that there is a small difference between lurking and stalking. Connor and Olivia have always been friends, but they had sex one time. Since then, Greg can feel the attraction between them, but Olivia denies it. Greg encourages him to talk to a girl, Jenny, sitting at a few tables over. It will make Olivia jealous. Olivia sees her ex-romantic partner, Kevin, with his wife. He's upset that she ghosted him, and Olivia's upset that Kevin is married. She walks away and sees Connor with Jenny. She convinces Jenny to go dancing with him. Olivia tells Connor that Jenny would be okay with a threesome, and they go back to his place. To Connor's surprise, Olivia is right.<br/><br/>Connor wakes up to Jenny in his bed, but Olivia is gone. Jenny and Connor spend time in the shower before she leaves. Connor walks to Olivia's favorite caf√©. They decide to have their first date. Weeks later, Connor and Olivia are a happy couple. Connor enters the bathroom to brush his teeth and finds a positive pregnancy test in the trash can. They decide to have the baby.<br/><br/>Connor and Olivia return home and find Jenny on their doorstep. She sullenly informs them that she's pregnant with Connor's baby too. She will keep her baby and is determined to do it alone if necessary. Olivia leaves. She refused to involve herself in Connor's drama. Olivia ends their blossoming relationship. She chooses not to keep her baby and runs to Kevin's home. Can Connor handle this wild circumstance when Olivia decides to keep their baby?<br/><br/>These three characters, Olivia, Connor, and Jenny, are some of the most insufferable people ever written. Connor is a masochist who caves at the slightest whimper from Olivia and Jenny. Olivia is a narcissistic, indecisive, bottomless pit of need. Jenny, the youngest of the bunch, is the most mature. She lies to her parents about the situation and keeps waiting for the 'right time' to come clean. The saving grace of this movie is the comedic relief of Greg. He is the audience's reaction and happily inserts himself in any situation. He loves the tea. Two camera angles stick out. First, Connor and Olivia discuss the pregnancy test. Connor faces the camera, while you can see Olivia in a reflection of the mirror. They are in the same room but with different perspectives. The next is when Connor learns a devastating secret. The angle slightly turns as he processes the information. This film is uncomfortably funny and charming. However, you may strongly dislike the conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Architect Theo Rose sulks as his colleagues celebrate their new building. They didn't incorporate his ideas, and he can't contain his irritation. He escapes the dinner and runs into the kitchen. There, Theo sees Prep Cook Ivy preparing food. She gives him a bite, and he gushes at the culinary delight. Ivy informs Theo that she's leaving to become a chef in America, and he jokingly says he will follow. They touch and shag in the walk-in freezer.<br/><br/>Ten years later, Theo and Ivy Rose are living in Mendocino, California, with two children, Roy and Hattie. Theo works for an architecture firm and receives his first high-profile client, the East Bay Maritime Museum. He creates a unique design that looks like a sailboat. Theo wants to use their dream home money to buy Ivy a restaurant. She's giddy and names it 'We Got Crabs.' The business has a slow start, so it's open 3 nights a week, leaving Ivy with the kids most days.<br/><br/>Months later, a horrific storm rolls into town. The city closes a major highway and pushes travelers to the road outside Ivy's establishment. One of those customers is a highly respected food critic. On the other side of town, Theo watches his building sway from the Museum store. As the sails screech, he eases patrons by saying the building is fine. Then, it collapses.<br/><br/>Theo's wild actions outside of the museum make him internet famous, while the critic praises Ivy's food, and the customers swarm. Theo loses his job while Ivy thrives. They decide to switch roles until Theo finds a job. This decision leads to bitterness, resentment, and ultimately, divorce for the couple. The Roses declare war when they both refuse to give up the house. He built it and she paid for it. Who will win this war of the Roses?<br/><br/>This classic film remake lives up to the hype with witty, dry humor from two phenomenal actors. Based on the novel, this movie offers something new for original fans while it attracts today's audience. The war is over the same issue, but includes a comical deep fake, a smart house, and Julia Child. When the couple is in love, they make snide comments to each other but laugh. As their marriage collapses, the actors add an edge to their biting comments that make the audience cringe, ooh, and ahh. When the arguement reaches its climax, the camera pans away from both actors. It's like their reasoning is leaving their body, only leaving room for rage. And the conclusion will leave you in total shock. This update to your favorite classic is perfect for the time, flawless, and a great date movie.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
