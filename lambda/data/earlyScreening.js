    "review":"A SWAT team must extract a CIA operative before the enemy can eliminate him.  On the way out, the protagonist finds a unique artifact and grabs it.  He puts the CIA operative in a van, but the enemy is inside and knocks them both out. He wakes up in a ship's medical bay.  He has been in a coma for months, and they fixed his teeth.  However, his SWAT team died.  The operative and the artifact they wanted to save is gone.  They want to invite the protagonist to a program called Tenet.  Tenet's mission is to stop World War three.  Not a nuclear war, but a temporal war. Laura shows the protagonist an inverted bullet.  Instead of shooting a bullet from his gun, the protagonist is catching the bullet fired in the future.  This inverted technology blows the protagonist's mind.  The protagonist doesn't who designed the technology, but the knows who to ask.  An arms dealer in Mumbai, on the top floor of a highly guarded fortress.  The protagonist calls his boss and tells the boss he will need help.  The boss sends Neil.  This temporal war will have the protagonist and Neil face to face with a controlling husband, a plane crash, and the inverted.<br/><br/>Tenet is a movie you will need to see twice.  Not just for the stunning cinematography, but to keep up with the storyline.  With time moving forwards and backward, you see the same scene but from a different angle.  It's captivating to see how the inverted and the non-inverted interact in the same space.  At one moment, a building is being put back together and destroyed at the same time.  The scene will leave you wonderstruck.  See it in IMAX to take it all in and pay attention to every detail.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"After killing everyone but Azar, before the C.I.A could obtain pertinent information about the plans for using stolen plutonium, J.J. is in the hot seat.  His boss, David Kim, doesn't believe J.J. is cut out for the C.I.A..  J.J. has one more chance to prove him wrong.  Victor's brother created a miniature nuclear bomb and Victor killed him for the plans.  However, Victor's brother hid the plans before Victor could find them. Victor's sister-in-law and his niece left Paris and moved to Chicago, J.J. and Bobbi - the tech - have to watch the widow and her child, in case Victor comes for them.  In Chicago, Sophie is a 9-year-old girl who is too smart for her own good. One day, her dog gives her a weird ball.  Sophie opens the ball and finds a computer chip.  She uses the internet to discover the ball is a wireless camera.  She traces the wireless connection to an apartment and finds Bobbi and J.J. arguing.  She starts to record them and sees their monitors spying on their department. Sophie's father was Victor's brother.  Sophie offers to keep their secret if J.J. helps her gain popularity in school.  If J.J. doesn't do it, she will upload the video of them and their surveillance to the internet.  This will end J.J. and Bobbi's career in the C.I.A.. Over time, he will become her tutor, mentor, confidant, and protector.  And she will show J.J. there is more to life than working alone.<br/><br/>J.J. gives the strong tough-guy image but he loves his fish Blueberry, sings Britney Spears, and wants soothing music to go to sleep.  Sophie is 9-years-old but she is a 2020's 9-year-old girl.  She can track WIFI connections, pass lie detectors, and use her street smarts to get in anywhere.  These two create a new buddy-kid-cop movie for this generation. Sophie isn't a helpless child. Her intelligence and acceptance is a refreshing twist on this genre.  Because of the violence - albeit mild - this movie is better suited for ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Mel and Mia achieved their childhood dream of owning a cosmetics line.  Mia is the creative side and Mel the finance side.  When Claire Luna asks to see them for a partnership, Mia says no.  But Mel tells Mia they are $437,000 in debt and can only keep their store open for 6 more months.  Mia agrees to see Claire.  Claire offers to pay their debt for 51% of the company.  If their launch goes well, Claire will give them 1.7 million dollars.  Mia says no.  She wants to be the boss.  Mel and Mia argue about the deal but Claire gives them another offer.  She will pay the debt for 49% of the company.  Giving Mia and Mel controlling interest.  If either of them quit, she will give 51%.  They agree.  While they are working for Claire, Claire is working them against each other.  Mel and Mia will have to get honest and use friendship to rise above the corporate world to be a boss.<br/><br/>This movie is a mix of The Boss and Girls Trip.  But with less business sense and less humor.  It does equally flush out the flaws in both characters and lays out their strengths.  You just don't get to see Mel have her greater moments.  Only her moments of weakness and being manipulated.  It would have been great to see her cultivate the ultimate plan and explain it to each member.  If you like a quick, easy laugh with a business 101 lesson added, see this movie matinee.  Otherwise, wait for Vudu.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",
