    "review":"Pulitzer Prize Winner Isabel Wilkerson stands in front of an image of August Landmesser. She explains his heroic act of defiance and how it came to be. Isabel leaves the stage, and her editor, Amari, congratulates her. Then, he asks her to write about the Trayvon Martin case. Amari points at racism, but Isabel believes that is a default and easy answer.<br/><br/>Isabel returns home and settles into bed with her husband, Brett, but something won't let her sleep. Later, Isabel talks to friends about Heather Heyer. Isabel believes both murders are somehow linked, and race is not the common denominator. The linking factor for generational atrocities is a caste system. Isabel doesn't want to explain the caste system but uncover the pillars of it. She will find links between American Slavery, the Holocaust, and the Dalit, and then create a groundbreaking book.<br/><br/>This movie describes the origin of Isabel's extraordinary novel Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent. She travels to the Southern U.S., Germany, and India to uncover the truth behind hatred, how it starts, and our responsibility. As Isabel works to heal and teach, she loses her foundation. Isabel asks the hard questions and doesn't accept the easy answer. She is the definition of a journalist. It's impossible to leave this film without learning something and thinking about the caste system and your place in it. Be prepared to cry, think, and change.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Book of Clarence",
    "review":"Clarence and Elijah lose a chariot race against Mary Magdalene after a gypsy shoots Clarence in the neck with a dart. A gypsy steals their horses and chariot. Clarence must create a plan because the horses, chariot, and wager money belong to Jebediah the Terrible. He will kill them for losing it. Then, Clarence sees his identical twin brother, Thomas, with Jesus and his apostles. He asks Thomas to introduce him to Jesus, but Thomas says no.<br/><br/>Clarence returns home and promises to give his mother a better life in a larger home. She wants Clarence to be happy with his crush, Varinia. Clarence and Elijah face Jebediah and alert him about their losses. Jebediah gives Clarence 29 days to come up with the rest of the money, or Jebediah will kill Clarence. Clarence runs to Varinia's workplace and begs for help. Jebediah is her brother, but she can't. She warns him to pay Jebediah soon.<br/><br/>Clarence and Elijah relax at a smoke shop. Clarence gets a bright idea after the first puff. He will become the 13th apostle. With the Messiah by his side, Clarence can convince Jebediah to forgive his debt and spare his life. Clarence meets with the apostles and gets a challenge from Judas. Clarence completes the mission, but Judas refuses to let Clarence join them. So, Clarence decides to think bigger. Clarence will declare himself the one and only Messiah. Sadly, Clarence doesn't know Rome wants to kill anyone who calls themselves the Messiah.<br/><br/>This movie is The Lion King 1 1/2 for the bible. Clarence lives in parallel to famous events in the bible while conning believers. The writers set the film in 33 A.D., but it has themes reminiscent of today, like police harassment, drug use, and miseducation. The writers use the era to handle these heavy topics satirically. Also, the film explains why people disagree about Jesus's outward appearance. While the movie starts funny, it concludes on a serious note, like Passion of the Christ. Be prepared to laugh and cringe at the theater, but you won't need to buy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Blackening",
    "review":"Morgan and Shawn rented a cabin in the woods for a Juneteenth celebration. Shawn finds a game room as Morgan decorates for the festivities. He gets Morgan to follow him to the room, and they find a game called The Blackening. It tells them to name one black character in a horror movie that lived. If they can't in 60 seconds, one of them will die. They say the wrong answer, and Shawn gets shot with an arrow. Morgan runs, but the killer grabs her.<br/><br/>Dewayne, Allison, and Lisa travel to the cabin, but Allison and Lisa have a secret. Dewayne doesn't care about their secret as long as Lisa's ex-boyfriend, Nnamdi, doesn't come. King and Nnamdi greet them when they arrive, much to Dewayne's chagrin.<br/><br/>Shanika pulls over for gas and gets Rap Snacks from the market. She bumps into Clifton but chooses not to remember his name. He explains that his phone died on the way to the cabin, and he doesn't have his charger. Shanika begrudgingly invites Clifton to follow her. They arrive late and find the group settling into a game of spades. The lights cut off, and the seven friends look for a fuse box. They find The Blackening. Believing it's a joke, they start to play. The game tells them to answer all the questions correctly, or Morgan dies. A TV turns on to show Morgan begging for her life. They must play, but will they all survive?<br/><br/>This movie is funny from beginning to end, but don't forget the profound questions it asks. First, what does it mean to be black? And next, is there a way to be black enough? This film is the fly on the wall. However, it plays up the laughs to ease a complex conversation. While it provides a few jump scares, this movie won't give you nightmares. And there is one mid-credit scene. This movie is for you if you enjoy M3GAN and Scary Movie.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
