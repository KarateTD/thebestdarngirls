    "mtitle":"The Threesome",
    "review":"Connor stares at Olivia from the bar. Connor's friend, Greg, warns Connor that there is a small difference between lurking and stalking. Connor and Olivia have always been friends, but they had sex one time. Since then, Greg can feel the attraction between them, but Olivia denies it. Greg encourages him to talk to a girl, Jenny, sitting at a few tables over. It will make Olivia jealous. Olivia sees her ex-romantic partner, Kevin, with his wife. He's upset that she ghosted him, and Olivia's upset that Kevin is married. She walks away and sees Connor with Jenny. She convinces Jenny to go dancing with him. Olivia tells Connor that Jenny would be okay with a threesome, and they go back to his place. To Connor's surprise, Olivia is right.<br/><br/>Connor wakes up to Jenny in his bed, but Olivia is gone. Jenny and Connor spend time in the shower before she leaves. Connor walks to Olivia's favorite caf√©. They decide to have their first date. Weeks later, Connor and Olivia are a happy couple. Connor enters the bathroom to brush his teeth and finds a positive pregnancy test in the trash can. They decide to have the baby.<br/><br/>Connor and Olivia return home and find Jenny on their doorstep. She sullenly informs them that she's pregnant with Connor's baby too. She will keep her baby and is determined to do it alone if necessary. Olivia leaves. She refused to involve herself in Connor's drama. Olivia ends their blossoming relationship. She chooses not to keep her baby and runs to Kevin's home. Can Connor handle this wild circumstance when Olivia decides to keep their baby?<br/><br/>These three characters, Olivia, Connor, and Jenny, are some of the most insufferable people ever written. Connor is a masochist who caves at the slightest whimper from Olivia and Jenny. Olivia is a narcissistic, indecisive, bottomless pit of need. Jenny, the youngest of the bunch, is the most mature. She lies to her parents about the situation and keeps waiting for the 'right time' to come clean. The saving grace of this movie is the comedic relief of Greg. He is the audience's reaction and happily inserts himself in any situation. He loves the tea. Two camera angles stick out. First, Connor and Olivia discuss the pregnancy test. Connor faces the camera, while you can see Olivia in a reflection of the mirror. They are in the same room but with different perspectives. The next is when Connor learns a devastating secret. The angle slightly turns as he processes the information. This film is uncomfortably funny and charming. However, you may strongly dislike the conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Roses",
    "review": "Architect Theo Rose sulks as his colleagues celebrate their new building. They didn't incorporate his ideas, and he can't contain his irritation. He escapes the dinner and runs into the kitchen. There, Theo sees Prep Cook Ivy preparing food. She gives him a bite, and he gushes at the culinary delight. Ivy informs Theo that she's leaving to become a chef in America, and he jokingly says he will follow. They touch and shag in the walk-in freezer.<br/><br/>Ten years later, Theo and Ivy Rose are living in Mendocino, California, with two children, Roy and Hattie. Theo works for an architecture firm and receives his first high-profile client, the East Bay Maritime Museum. He creates a unique design that looks like a sailboat. Theo wants to use their dream home money to buy Ivy a restaurant. She's giddy and names it 'We Got Crabs.' The business has a slow start, so it's open 3 nights a week, leaving Ivy with the kids most days.<br/><br/>Months later, a horrific storm rolls into town. The city closes a major highway and pushes travelers to the road outside Ivy's establishment. One of those customers is a highly respected food critic. On the other side of town, Theo watches his building sway from the Museum store. As the sails screech, he eases patrons by saying the building is fine. Then, it collapses.<br/><br/>Theo's wild actions outside of the museum make him internet famous, while the critic praises Ivy's food, and the customers swarm. Theo loses his job while Ivy thrives. They decide to switch roles until Theo finds a job. This decision leads to bitterness, resentment, and ultimately, divorce for the couple. The Roses declare war when they both refuse to give up the house. He built it and she paid for it. Who will win this war of the Roses?<br/><br/>This classic film remake lives up to the hype with witty, dry humor from two phenomenal actors. Based on the novel, this movie offers something new for original fans while it attracts today's audience. The war is over the same issue, but includes a comical deep fake, a smart house, and Julia Child. When the couple is in love, they make snide comments to each other but laugh. As their marriage collapses, the actors add an edge to their biting comments that make the audience cringe, ooh, and ahh. When the arguement reaches its climax, the camera pans away from both actors. It's like their reasoning is leaving their body, only leaving room for rage. And the conclusion will leave you in total shock. This update to your favorite classic is perfect for the time, flawless, and a great date movie.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Superman",
    "review": "Three minutes ago, Superman lost his first fight to the Hammer of Boravia. Superman crash-lands in Antarctica and summons Krypto. Krypto pulls Superman to his Fortress of Solitude. His robots scan him and find a slew of injuries. They play a video message from Superman's parents, Jor-El and Lara, before the treatment to soothe him. Superman can only hear half of the message. His Earth landing corrupted the other half. Superman heals and returns to Metropolis to defeat the Hammer. He doesn't see that Angela followed him. She spots Superman's hideout and runs towards it, but it disappears. Lex Luthor tells Angela to return to headquarters because he can find the Fortress later.<br/><br/>Clark Kent, Superman's mild-mannered alter ego, returns to The Daily Planet with a smile because his interview with Superman made the front page. His co-worker, reporter Lois Lane, asks how he got another exclusive with the local hero, and Clark responds that they are friends.<br/><br/>Lex Luthor meets with U.S. leaders and requests that they use his technology, Planetwatch, to guard the U.S., not Superman. Lex doesn't believe the alien metahuman is trustworthy. While a few agree with him, the rest disagree because Lex lacks evidence. He flies to Antarctica with his crew and forces the Fortress to reveal itself. Then, Angela hacks into the computer system and finds the message from Superman's parents. She uses her enhanced skills to retrieve the other half of the message. Angela decodes it while Lex can't contain his grin.<br/><br/>After saving Metropolis with the Justice Gang - Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Mr. Terrific, Superman doesn't get the expected applause. The news outlets are playing Jor-El and Lara's message in its entirety. They wanted Kal-El to come to Earth, conquer humans, start a harem, and conceive many children to restart their bloodline. The Earth turns against Superman, and the U.S. government serves Superman with a warrant. He turns himself in after saying goodbye to Lois. The government determined that their jail system couldn't hold him. So, they turn Superman over to Lex's Planetwatch. Can Superman escape and save his reputation?<br/><br/>Director James Gunn has saved the D C E U.. This film isn't an origin story. The opening sequence updates viewers with a one-sentence statement about 3 million years ago, 3 decades ago, 3 months ago, 3 weeks ago, and 3 minutes ago. It prepares the audience to enter Superman's world at a specific place in time. Lois's interview with Superman has been a heated debate among comic book fans for years. This film has a delightful dose of comedy. With any Gunn film, you must keep an eye on the background. Even the robots have great one-liners. This picture is visually beautiful. Yes, there's a lot of CGI, but it doesn't distract from the story. There is one mid-credit and one post-credit scene. The best description of this film is the fall of Lex Luthor. One thing is for sure: you will laugh out loud at Krypto, feel fear for Jimmy, and cringe in disgust at nanobots. And it's worth it. Don't let the genre fool you; this picture is a must-see.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina",
    "review": "Eve listens to her ballerina music globe when her father, Javier, tells her to hide as they practice. She opens a secret door in the wall and looks through a slat to watch Javier. They put Javier on his knees as the Chancellor enters. He gives Javier two options. First, Javier can end his life, and they will take Eve. Or Javier can shoot the Chancellor, and the assassins will kill Javier and Eve. When Eve sees that Javier is losing, she comes from her hiding place, grabs the gun, notices the X etched in the killer's ankle, and shoots him. Javier and Eve make it out of their home alive, but Javier succumbs to his injuries.<br/><br/>Winston finds Eve and offers to take her to her family, the Ruska Roma. Eve meets the Director, and the Director sees Eve's pain. She allows Eve to stay, but Eve must follow the rules and train. Twelve years later, Eve dances with bloody feet, spars, and shoots under the tutelage of Nogi. One day, Eve hears fellow ballerinas whispering about the Baba Yaga, and she runs to the hallway to catch a glimpse of the legend. She wants to get out of training and into killing. John tells her to train harder but warns her to get out while she still can.<br/><br/>Eve impresses the Director and gets her first assignment. She succeeds and becomes a full-fledged member of the family. After finishing her latest contract, Eve collects her bounty, gathers her knives from corpses, and calmly exits the club. She gets in her car and drives away, but an assassin slams into her vehicle. Eve battles the killer and spots the X etched into his wrist. She cuts off his hand and brings it to the Director. The Director tells Eve that she will cause chaos by seeking revenge.<br/><br/>Eve travels to the Continental and gives Charon her gold coin. She wants to talk to Winston. The assassins aren't a tribe like the Ruska Roma. They are a cult. Eve demands their location, but Winston doesn't know where they are. He knows a member of the cult, Daniel Pine, is staying at another Continental. He gives Eve the location. Eve is on a mission to kill the man who murdered her father, and she will go against the Ruska Roma to do it.<br/><br/>This movie epitomizes cinematic beauty while following the John Wick format. The combat scenes have magnificent choreography. However, the editing is too jittery. Nonetheless, the enjoyable and unique battles play into Eve's strengths. You won't forget the flamethrower showdown. The film never sexualizes Eve. It's refreshing to see a dangerous woman complete a mission without secondary nonsense. This installment can grow, but it needs the proper writers, costume and set designers, and choreography. This film is better in IMAX.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Life of Chuck",
    "review": "Marty has a young man read Walt Whitman's Songs of Myself to the class, but no one pays attention because a part of California sank into the ocean after a 9.1 earthquake. Marty calls his ex-wife, nurse Felicia. Over the past few days, Marty has noticed signs around town thanking Chuck Krantz for his 39 years of service. Felicia heard Chuck's commercial on the radio. Neither of them knows who this man is or what he means to the town. Marty and Felicia discuss the cosmic calendar as they wait for the world's inevitable doom.<br/><br/>Taylor left Juilliard and now works in a record store. She plays drums on the street for spare change. One day, she sees Chuck walking down the street. She matches the beat to his stride. Chuck puts down his briefcase and starts to groove. After a profitable show, Taylor questions why Chuck stopped. He doesn't have an answer.<br/><br/>Chuck moved in with his grandparents after his parents and unborn sister died in a car crash. Three years later, Chuck's grandmother starts cooking again. She loves dancing to rock and roll while cooking. One day, she asks Chuck to join her. Chuck's grandparents have one rule: stay out of the conical. However, Chuck's curiosity gets the better of him, and he tries to open the door. His grandfather yells at Chuck, accidentally pushes Chuck down the steps, freezes in the doorway, grabs his arm, and shuts the door. He apologizes to Chuck and demands that Chuck take heed. Chuck has no idea what life has in store for him and the impact every person will make. It's time to witness Chuck.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by Steven King, this movie won't make sense until the end. The narrator tells the story of Chuck's life in three acts in reverse. In Act 3, the world is slowly falling apart. Pay attention to the poem, commercial, characters' speeches, and TV. The plot will revisit these themes during the first and second acts. Act two is the most lighthearted. Accountant Chuck chooses to enjoy the world around him and dance. Act one is the most honest and will connect the viewers with young Chuck. These formidable years have the most profound impact on Acts 2 and 3. This film is a mystical enigma surrounding an ordinary life. The Life of Chuck shows how beautiful yours can be when you choose to live it to the fullest.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
