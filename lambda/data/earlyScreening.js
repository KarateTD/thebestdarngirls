    "mtitle": "Paddington in Peru",
    "review": "Paddington celebrates becoming a British citizen and can travel the world with his new passport. While Paddington's life has changed, so has the Brown's. Judy Brown applies to university while her mother, Mary, cries over Judy leaving the nest. Jonathan Brown invents ways to make chilling easier while gaming, and his dad, Henry, creates new risk manuals to impress his American boss, Madison. During the meeting, Madison wants Henry to embrace risk.<br/><br/>Paddington writes to his Aunt Lucy at the Home for Retired Bears. She rescued him in the Peruvian Amazon years ago and cared for him until he arrived in London. Then, he receives a letter from Reverend Mother at the home. She states that Lucy is sad and only speaks of him. She worries Lucy's condition will worsen and advises Paddington to visit.<br/><br/>Paddington tells the Browns he wants to go to Peru. Mary thinks this will entice much-needed family time before Judy leaves. And Henry believes this calculated risk will impress Madison. The Browns pack up and travel to Peru.<br/><br/>Paddington runs to Aunt Lucy's cabin when they arrive at the retirement home. Sadly, Reverend Mother reports that Aunt Lucy is missing. He searches her room and stumbles upon a map with an X over the Rumi Rocks. The Browns refuse to let Paddington travel alone and volunteer to go with him.<br/><br/>Paddington and the Browns consider ways to travel through the jungle. Then, a man on a boat floats downstream. He introduces himself, Captain Hunter, and his daughter, Skipper Gina. He knows the Rumi Rocks because of the myth. Many believe the rocks are the doorway to El Dorado, the lost city of gold. The Browns travel to find Aunt Lucy, but others have ill intentions.<br/><br/>Based on the heartwarming series, this movie is an adventurous comedy for the whole family. The graphics are seamless and keep the viewer grounded in the Paddington world. The actors gave a stellar performance while acting with the stand-in. The script doesn't rely on sneaky adult jokes or toilet humor for a laugh. This movie focuses on two morals: what do you treasure and where do you belong. This adventure answers those questions beautifully and lovingly with several twists and turns. You don't need to see the first two films to enjoy this beautiful installment.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "One of Them Days",
    "review": "Dreux finishes the night shift at Norm's Diner and waits for her best friend, Alyssa, to pick her up. Alyssa arrives with a list of excuses because she assumes she's late. However, Dreux lied about the pick-up time. Dreux looks forward to resting at home because she has an interview at 4 p.m. today to become a franchise manager. Dreux remembers it's the first of the month and asks if Alyssa paid their landlord, Uche. Alyssa says yes.<br/><br/>Dreux enters her apartment and trips over Keshawn's sneakers. She's furious because Alyssa's boyfriend asked to stay for six days six months ago. He hasn't helped pay for anything and puts his shoes everywhere, including on Alyssa's paintings. Dreux thinks Keshawn is disrespectful, but Alyssa says her paintings aren't good enough.<br/><br/>Dreux lays in bed and puts on her eye mask to sleep. Then, she hears banging on the door. It's Uche demanding the rent. He says Alyssa didn't pay him. They must pay him by 6 p.m., or he will evict them. Dreux bangs on Alyssa's bedroom door. She admits that she gave the money to Keshawn to pay Uche. They turn to face Keshawn, but he and his sneakers are gone. They unlock his phone and find text messages from a girl named Berniece.<br/><br/>Dreux and Alyssa scam their way into Berniece's home. Alyssa finds Keshawn asleep with his wallet between his knees. She looks inside, and it's empty. Alyssa wakes Keshawn, and he admits he used their rent money to make fake Gucci t-shirts. Berniece chases them out of her home but stops when she hits a parked car. Alyssa and Dreux escape. Berniece stands and sees people in the neighborhood laughing and filming her. She vows to find Alyssa and Dreux and attack them. Dreux and Alyssa, thinking Berniece will forget about them, must create a plan to make $1500 in 9 hours and get Dreux to her interview in 7 hours. They will fight, deal, bleed, and test their friendship before the day ends.<br/><br/>Alyssa and Dreux considered every possible option to obtain their rent money. They try applying for payday loans, donating blood, and selling things online. However, two steps forward bring them one step back. It's all for a reason. Unlike some comedies, every scene has a purpose and comes full circle. This day brings their friendship to the ultimate test. The plot interjects heart, life lessons, comedy, and perseverance at the proper moments. The script allows itself to be serious but doesn't become preachy. This film is not for the whole family but an entertaining night out for the adults.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Last Showgirl",

She invites Mary-Anne, Jodie, and their producer, Eddie.<br/><br/>Everyone enjoys Shelly's cooking until Eddie drops by with sad news. He heard they are ending The Razzle Dazzle show. Shelly can't believe it because The Razzle Dazzle has been on the Las Vegas strip for 30 years. None of the women believe Eddie until they go to work in the morning. Eddie announces over the loudspeaker as they get dressed. The Razzle Dazzle will end in two weeks. Now, Shelly has to determine how to live out of the spotlight.<br/><br/>Shelly spins out of control as her world crashes around her. She fears the future while clinging on to the past. Shelly attempts to reconnect with her ex-boyfriend and daughter. They give her the same advice: move on. However, Shelly pushes them away and praises the show's heyday. Also, Shelly contemplates and faces everything she gave up to be on stage. It's sad to watch her spiral and get hit with a harsh dose of reality, but she needs it. The actors did an amazing job of highlighting these performers and the pitfalls of their work. This movie has an independent film conclusion but will make you think about your career. You won't buy the film, but it's wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Red One",
    "review": "Cal surveys the area while Santa Claus talks to children at the mall. Christmas is in less than 48 hours, and Santa wants to prep with exercise. Mrs. Claus counts his reps and gingerly walks towards the door when Cal enters, holding an envelope. Cal is the Captain of Santa's security team, ELF, but wants to resign. Santa sadly accepts Cal's resignation and asks Cal to stay on until the final run. Cal agrees. He reminisces on a bridge and sees lights flicker in the distance. When the anomaly continues, Cal questions if anyone has eyes on Santa. He runs to Santa's bedroom when no one sees him. Cal sees someone driving away with Santa. Cal chases them but loses Santa.<br/><br/>The director of MORA, Zoe, has a video call to get an update from Cal. Cal informs Zoe that a team broke through the North Pole cloaking device and kidnapped Santa. Agent Garcia checked the dark web and discovered someone stole equipment to test seismic activity. People in the underworld call the person The Wolf. The Wolf's real name is Jack.<br/><br/>They find Jack in his apartment, but he fights back. Zoe stuns Jack and ties him to a chair. She orders her soldiers to box Jack up and take him to the North Pole. Zoe will double Jack's fee if he tracks the client. Jack accepts.<br/><br/>Cal and Jack locate the client, Tim, a mercenary. Tim is too afraid to say the name and writes it in the sand. Jack reads the name Grýla out loud, and Grýla hears it. She possesses Tim's body to deliver a warning. Grýla believes naughty people don't fear Santa. She wants the world to be kinder. So, Grýla will go through the naughty list and punish anyone listed, no matter the offense. Grýla needs Santa's magic to complete her mission to force the world to be nice or else. Can Cal and Jack stop Grýla in time to save Christmas?<br/><br/>The visual effects are fun, but the humor falls flat. The script describes Jack as a level 4 naughty lister. He is a degenerate gambler with a stealing habit. Also, he's neglecting his son, Dylan. Cal surveys the world and sees angry, mean, and ungrateful adults. He's lost his wonder and doesn't think it will return. Cal and Jack must grow to save Santa, but it becomes boring. This film could be 30 minutes shorter and make the same point.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever",
    "review": "The small town of Emmanuel is abuzz because their 75th Annual Christmas Pageant is falling on Christmas Eve. But Beth Bradley doesn't feel the joy because the pageant hasn't changed. She attends Sunday school with her brother, Charlie. Their topic is 'why I love church.' Charlie tells the members he loves attending church because the Herdmans aren't there. The Herdmans are a family of kids that steal, smoke, start fires, and fight. The eldest, Imogene, leads her younger siblings - Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - as they terrorize the town.<br/><br/>Bob and Grace prepare their home for the holidays when they see flashing lights across the street. Grace and Beth spy the paramedics wheeling Mrs. Armstrong out because she broke her legs. Beth's friend, Alice, and Alice's mother, Rebecca, check on Mrs. Armstrong too. Grace mentions becoming acting director, but Rachel hints that Grace isn't up to Mrs. Armstrong's standards. Grace takes the job.<br/><br/>Two days in a row, the Herdmans stole Charlie's lunch. On the third day, Charlie gave it to them. Then, he bragged about receiving free food and snacks at church. When the Herdmans arrive at church, everyone stops and stares. The Herdmans sit with the students as Grace tells them about the play. Imogene wants to be Mary, her sister the Angel, and her brothers will be Joseph and the wise men. They threaten the other children to dominate the parts.<br/><br/>The parents meet Grace at Mrs. Armstrong's home. They demand Grace pull the Herdmans out of the play. Grace reminds them their kids didn't volunteer. She refuses to exclude the Herdmans and vows it will be the best pageant ever. But can she deliver?<br/><br/>Based on The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson, this film brings the children's classic to life. Fans of the book will recognize passages from the beloved tale and memorable scenes they imagined. The Herdman children are wild and have a tainted past with the townspeople. However, the Bradleys slowly see the changes in the children and the non-Christian behavior in the community. The same joy and faith you get from the book will ignite in the theater. The Herdmans aren't lost children. The community ignored them. This film is the perfect start to the holiday season and will become a classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
