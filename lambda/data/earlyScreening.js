"review": "Ms. Morrible announces to the Ozians that Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, still has the Glimmerie. She warns them not to trust Elphaba or the animals. They want to harm the Wizard. She enters Glinda's home with a new mode of transportation from the Wizard. Since Elphaba can fly, they need their symbol of good to be airborne also. Morrible tells Glinda to be ready to become a beacon of encouragement for the Ozians.<br/><br/>Glinda floats as Morrible tells the crowd that she is Glinda the Good Witch. Then, the Chief of the Gale Force, Prince Fiyero, enters with his men. Morrible tells the Ozians that they are engaged. He sighs and agrees to wed her. Then, Elphaba flies through the sky and writes, 'Our Wizard Lies.' Before the people can see it, Morrible changes it to 'Wizard Dies.' She tells them that Elphaba wants to kill the Wizard. To Glinda's regret, the Ozians hate Elphaba.<br/><br/>Nessarose took over her father's role as governor after his passing. The Wizard wants her to sign a decree to ban all animals. However, Boq begs her not to do it. Later, he sees the flyer advertising Glinda's wedding. He ends his relationship with Nessarose and runs for the train. However, it's too late. Nessarose signed a law banning animals and Munchkins from leaving Munchkinland. She forces Boq to work for her.<br/><br/>Elphaba finds the remaining animals in the forest. They found an underground passage, under the yellow brick road that leads them outside of Oz. She begs them to stay because the area outside is vastly empty. She promises to make Oz safe for them again. They will only feel secure when she dies. This truth breaks Elphaba's heart as they leave.<br/><br/>Glinda cries after a betrayal. Morrible fumes at Elphaba for ruining her spectacle. She and the Wizard consider ways of making Elphaba pay. Glinda tells them to create a rumor about Nessarose. Elphaba will come to her rescue. Morrible says Elphaba is too smart to fall for a rumor. They need a change of weather. One cyclone will create the legend of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good. Now, you will know the truth behind it all.<br/><br/>This remarkable feat of music, lighting, acting, fun, and drama will leave you stunned and thoroughly entertained. The director used the first movie to introduce the audience to the characters and their backstory. This next film contains passion, rage, propaganda, and a twist. The colors jump off the screen, and the vanity department finds new ways to incorporate the leads' signature hues. The juxtaposition of Elphaba walking down an aisle of cages with Glinda walking down the aisle will amaze you and break your heart. And let's not forget the slaps heard around the world. Without dominating the plot, the writers seamlessly wove the Wizard of Oz film with this story. This picture is a must-see on the biggest screen and the best sound.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Threesome",
    "review":"Connor stares at Olivia from the bar. Connor's friend, Greg, warns Connor that there is a small difference between lurking and stalking. Connor and Olivia have always been friends, but they had sex one time. Since then, Greg can feel the attraction between them, but Olivia denies it. Greg encourages him to talk to a girl, Jenny, sitting at a few tables over. It will make Olivia jealous. Olivia sees her ex-romantic partner, Kevin, with his wife. He's upset that she ghosted him, and Olivia's upset that Kevin is married. She walks away and sees Connor with Jenny. She convinces Jenny to go dancing with him. Olivia tells Connor that Jenny would be okay with a threesome, and they go back to his place. To Connor's surprise, Olivia is right.<br/><br/>Connor wakes up to Jenny in his bed, but Olivia is gone. Jenny and Connor spend time in the shower before she leaves. Connor walks to Olivia's favorite café. They decide to have their first date. Weeks later, Connor and Olivia are a happy couple. Connor enters the bathroom to brush his teeth and finds a positive pregnancy test in the trash can. They decide to have the baby.<br/><br/>Connor and Olivia return home and find Jenny on their doorstep. She sullenly informs them that she's pregnant with Connor's baby too. She will keep her baby and is determined to do it alone if necessary. Olivia leaves. She refused to involve herself in Connor's drama. Olivia ends their blossoming relationship. She chooses not to keep her baby and runs to Kevin's home. Can Connor handle this wild circumstance when Olivia decides to keep their baby?<br/><br/>These three characters, Olivia, Connor, and Jenny, are some of the most insufferable people ever written. Connor is a masochist who caves at the slightest whimper from Olivia and Jenny. Olivia is a narcissistic, indecisive, bottomless pit of need. Jenny, the youngest of the bunch, is the most mature. She lies to her parents about the situation and keeps waiting for the 'right time' to come clean. The saving grace of this movie is the comedic relief of Greg. He is the audience's reaction and happily inserts himself in any situation. He loves the tea. Two camera angles stick out. First, Connor and Olivia discuss the pregnancy test. Connor faces the camera, while you can see Olivia in a reflection of the mirror. They are in the same room but with different perspectives. The next is when Connor learns a devastating secret. The angle slightly turns as he processes the information. This film is uncomfortably funny and charming. However, you may strongly dislike the conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
