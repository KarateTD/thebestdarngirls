    "mtitle":"American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story",
    "review":"Kurt Warner watched Super Bowl 19, and Joe Montana inspired him to play.  With the odds stacked against him, Kurt joined the University of Northern Iowa football team.  He wants to make a highlight reel for agents and the NFL draft.  So, Kurt asks Coach Allen to give him a chance.  After a grueling practice, Kurt gets to start and make enough plays for his reel.<br/><br/>One night, Mike Hudnutt invites Kurt to go line dancing.  He sees a beautiful woman on the dance floor, and she gives him a look.  The next day, Kurt begs Mike to teach him how to dance.  Later, Kurt asks the woman for a dance.  Before their final dance, she tells Kurt that she's Brenda and leaves.  Brenda tells Kurt it won't work because she is a divorced mom with two kids.  To Brenda's surprise, Kurt shows up at her door the next day with a rose.  Her oldest son, Zack, lets Kurt into the house, and they bond instantly.<br/><br/>After a successful string of games, Kurt finds an agent and waits on the NFL draft picks.  Though the NFL didn't draft him, the Green Bay Packers hired him with a $5,000 signing bonus.  After two days, the Packers cut him.  Jim Foster sits at their table and offers Kurt a position with the Arena Football League during a rare date night for Kurt and Brenda.  Kurt laughs and calls it a place for players going down the drain.  Kurt doesn't plan on joining unless heck freezes over.  Well, Kurt will get his wish and his first step into the NFL.<br/><br/>Based on All Things Possible: My Story of Faith, Football, and the First Miracle Season by Kurt Warner, this movie proves perseverance wins overall.  As the film begins, viewers get the stats of high school players moving to college and then to the NFL.  Hearing these stats allows you to understand the odds Kurt faced on his way to becoming MVP in Super Bowl 34.  From learning how to dance, risking life and limb for his family, and staying in the pocket, Kurt's difficult moments prepared him for the next step in life and the game.  But, it's what Kurt does off the field that gives him joy.  His work with Treasure House brings him and Brenda more pride than his football career.  Also, the film does a great job of blending old footage with today's filming.  While the story is encouraging and gives you a sense of faith, you won't have an urge to buy or watch again.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"A Journal for Jordan",
    "review":"Dana visits her father for his birthday and walks in to find a stranger.  He introduces himself as 1st Sergeant Charles Monroe King.  Charles tells Dana that her father is on the back porch, and he was hanging a picture that he painted.  Soon they are talking on the phone every day. When Charles gets some leave, he visits Dana in New York.  Then, September 11th brought reality to their relationship.  While Charles is at the range, Dana tells him that she wants to start a family.  He one-ups her and asks to get married, and she says yes.  Soon Dana is pregnant, but he has his orders.  So Dana gives Charles a journal filled with questions for a father to answer for his child.  Years later, Dana will use that journal to guide her son, Jordan, through difficult moments of his life, like dealing with Charles's death.<br/><br/>Based on A Journal for Jordan: A Story of Love and Honor by Dana Canedy, this film is a heartfelt love letter to Jordan about his parents.  Although he doesn't remember his father, Jordan can read the love Charles held in his heart.  Because this movie doesn't have a linear timeline, you can't be late.  The film starts with the spark that made Dana write the book.  While their love was short, their words will exist forever.  FYI, this movie is for adults.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Riff and the Jets go through the Puerto Rican part of town and harass the locals.  After an altercation with a rival Puerto Rican gang, the Sharks, Riff wants to arrange a fight.  But he wants to do it with Tony by his side.  Tony was a Jet until he spent time in prison for nearly beating a man to death.  Now, he works in Doc's pharmacy for Valentina.<br/><br/>María lives with her brother, Bernardo, and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita.  Bernardo picked the perfect guy to bring Maríe to the dance, Chino.  Bernardo tells María to stay away from gringos and only dance with Chino.<br/><br/>At the dance, the Jets take over the dance floor.

Can love conquer all?<br/><br/>Based on the play and the 1961 movie, this film stays true to the original while fixing issues from the past.  This movie covers race, love, gentrification, and gang dynamics using the same dialogue.  Because of larger sets, they can perform awe-inspiring dance numbers with compelling camera angles.  Mr. Spielberg even takes set designs and backdrops from the original play.  If you are not a fan of the musical, this isn't the one for you.  But give it a try.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Clifford the Big Red Dog",
    "review":"Emily feels like the odd girl out because she is a scholarship student at an elite private school. While her mother, Maggie, wants to help, Emily decides to deal with it on her terms.  Maggie has to go out of town for work, and much to Emily's chagrin, her uncle Casey is the only available babysitter. As Casey walks Emily to school, Emily sees Mr. Bridwell's Animal Rescue tent at school. Mr. Bridwell takes them to an empty part of the tent and directs Emily to go up the stairs.  Up there, Emily finds a bright red dog. Emily questions Mr. Bridwell about the dog.  Mr. Bridwell says that someone abandoned the dog, and it will grow to the size of the love in her heart.  However, they leave the dog behind. As she lays on the bed, Emily sees her bookbag move.  Emily opens the bookbag to find the red dog inside.  She names the dog Clifford and attempts to hide it from Casey.  The plan fails in an instant when Clifford steals Casey's lunch.<br/><br/>He lets Emily have Clifford for the night, but they will return the dog in the morning. Casey wants to return the large dog to Mr. Bridwell, but they can't find him on the internet.  So they decide to take Clifford to the vet instead.  A few of the neighbors film Clifford, and it goes viral.  The video catches the attention of Life Grow's CEO, Zack Tieran.  His company spent $400 million attempting to reduce hunger by creating genetically-engineered enormous food.  He thinks Clifford will be the key, and nothing will stop Zack from getting the big red dog.<br/><br/>Based on Clifford the Big Red Dog by Norman Bridwell, this movie teaches as it entertains.  And Emily learns two lessons.  First, being unique is good. Second, you must speak up for yourself. There are a lot of high jinxes and a Three Stooges fight, but it's the sense of community that warms your heart.  While Emily's neighbors gripe at each other, they stand together for this little girl and her big dog.  Your children will love the story, but adults may get too focused on the choppy graphics.  Just remind yourself that this movie is for children, so it tells a story and doesn't try to be a cinematic marvel.  With that, the film is enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"CODA",
    "review":"Ruby and Gretia stand in line to sign up for electives.  When Ruby hears her crush, Miles, signing up for choir, she does too.  On the first day of practice, Mr. Bernardo has each of the kids sing to sort them into their respective ranges.  When Ruby has her turn, she runs out of class.  When she goes home, she sees her parents, Jackie and Frank, arguing about money.  The next day, Ruby summons the courage to sing for Mr. Bernardo.  He believes she has a unique talent that requires nurturing.  And with guidance, she could use her voice to get into Berklee College of Music.  When Ruby comes home to tell Jackie, Ruby gets an unexpected response.<br/><br/>Jackie believes Ruby joined the choir as a sign of teenage rebellion against Jackie, Frank, and Ruby's brother, Leo.  Ruby is a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults, and is the only hearing-abled person in her family.  When she works on the fishing boat with Leo and Frank, she fishes and interprets radio calls.  She has translated for them since she was a young child, and they enormously depend on her to help them communicate with other fisherpeople, the townspeople, fish auctioneers, and doctors.  When Ruby and Leo feel like the auctioneers cheat them, Leo tries to persuade Frank to start a co-op, but he won't do it. But as the government steps in, it's too much for Frank to take and afford.  He decides to start the co-op with his family.  As the family needs her more than ever, can Ruby fulfill her singing dreams without destroying the family's new business?<br/><br/>This coming-of-age film is unlike any other because Ruby dealt with adult issues long before she was a teenager.  Leo, the eldest sibling, feels like their parents treat him like a baby because he can't hear.  Jackie and Frank need her because they can't afford an interpreter.  Ruby is a teenager that wants to shake off the adult responsibilities she deals with every day.  Watching Ruby and her family grow will bring a tear to your eye and make you want to learn how to sign.  It will move you as Ruby shows her pride for her family while singing 'Both Sides, Now.'  A poignant song for the turning point in this film and Ruby's family.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
