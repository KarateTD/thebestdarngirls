    "mtitle":"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare",
    "review":"Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to involve the Americans in the Second British World War in the 1940s. Churchill relied on Brigadier Colin Gubbins to devise a strategy and form the covert Special Operations Executive.<br/><br/>Brigadier Gubbins want to cut the Nazi's supply lines but sinking their supply ships. He calls this mission Operation Postmaster. Since this operation is covert, he needs ungentlemanly soldiers to carry out the mission. Gubbins selected actress Marjorie Stewart and club owner Mr. Heron to gain intel. However, his most unattractive selection is a prisoner, Gus March-Phillips. If the British catch him, they will arrest him. But the Nazis will torture and kill him.<br/><br/>Phillips accepts the mission but wants to add four more members to the team. First, Anders 'The Hammer' Lassen is known for his fighting skills and has a grudge against the Nazis. Freddy Alvarez loves to blow things up, while Henry Hayes can sail anything. The final member of Phillips's team is master strategist Geoffery 'Apple' Appleyard. But he is behind heavily-guarded enemy lines. Phillips, Lassen, and Alvarez will break Appleyard out while Heron and Stewart gain intel. Then, they will convene to take down the Nazi supply line. Even the best-laid plan has a few unforeseen obstacles. Can Phillips and his ungentle soldiers change the face of warfare?<br/><br/>Based on Churchill's Secret Warriors by Damien Lewis, this movie has action, espionage, and dark comedy. It uses natural lighting and appropriate technology to put the audience in the period. The scripts give you nail-biting moments as Heron and Stewart gather intel under the enemy's watchful eye. The unlikely troops kill with cat-like precision as they use knives, axes, and guns to subdue their foe. Of course, the plot has glamorized action, but the foundation of the actual events is evident. This film isn't for kids but has mystery, action, and fun for everyone.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Arthur the King",
    "review":"Mikael Linford ran with his team during the 2015 Adventure World Racing Championship. Liam realized the current works against them, but Mikael wanted to continue. After trekking through debris-filled mud, the team knows they lost.<br/><br/>Three years later, Mikael is a married man with a young daughter. Mikael knows it's his last chance to enter the race and win. So, his wife, Helena, encourages him to race. Mikael finds the best team and convinces them to compete with him. He picks Olivia because she has excellent climbing skills and Chik for his navigation abilities under pressure. Before Mikael unveils the third teammate, the sponsors stop him. They want Liam to be the final selection, or they won't help. Mikael promises to persuade Liam to join. The sponsor will only give $50,000. So, Mikael says yes.<br/><br/>Mikael trains with his team and starts the race. Over five days, these teams will race to transition points. At a point, Mikael and his team are behind but take a break to eat. Mikael gets the meatballs and sees a dog watching. He offers the dog some food. It takes a while for the dog to trust Mikael, but the dog eats. Scores of miles later, Mikael's team made significant ground and cut their rest short. Liam and Mikael argue over Chik's health and Mikael's attitude. Then, they hear barking. It's the same dog that Mikael gave meatballs to. The dog growls as they try to proceed. Then, Mikael carefully steps forward and sees the edge of a cliff. They thank the dog and make him a member of the team. Mikael thinks the dog acts like a king, so Mikael names the dog Arthur. Mikael believes he's found the perfect pet to share his pain bucket. But will Mikael's mind change when he has a complex decision: the race or the dog.<br/><br/>Based on Arthur: The Dog Who Crossed the Jungle to Find a Home by Mikael Lindnord, this movie takes liberties with the location and race's name but it's fun to watch. Viewers will see Arthur's struggles to survive before Mikael and their instant bond. And the director didn't speed up the race through dangerous terrain to rush Mikael and Arthur's meeting. It will make the audience appreciate the journey Arthur made to find Mikael. Seeing Mikael's tribulations to keep Arthur will pull at your heartstrings. While the story is entertaining, you won't yearn to purchase it. One viewing on the big screen is enough to make you appreciate the film, the race, and the team, including Arthur.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
