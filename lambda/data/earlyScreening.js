    "review": "Cal surveys the area while Santa Claus talks to children at the mall. Christmas is in less than 48 hours, and Santa wants to prep with exercise. Mrs. Claus counts his reps and gingerly walks towards the door when Cal enters, holding an envelope. Cal is the Captain of Santa's security team, ELF, but wants to resign. Santa sadly accepts Cal's resignation and asks Cal to stay on until the final run. Cal agrees. He reminisces on a bridge and sees lights flicker in the distance. When the anomaly continues, Cal questions if anyone has eyes on Santa. He runs to Santa's bedroom when no one sees him. Cal sees someone driving away with Santa. Cal chases them but loses Santa.<br/><br/>The director of MORA, Zoe, has a video call to get an update from Cal. Cal informs Zoe that a team broke through the North Pole cloaking device and kidnapped Santa. Agent Garcia checked the dark web and discovered someone stole equipment to test seismic activity. People in the underworld call the person The Wolf. The Wolf's real name is Jack.<br/><br/>They find Jack in his apartment, but he fights back. Zoe stuns Jack and ties him to a chair. She orders her soldiers to box Jack up and take him to the North Pole. Zoe will double Jack's fee if he tracks the client. Jack accepts.<br/><br/>Cal and Jack locate the client, Tim, a mercenary. Tim is too afraid to say the name and writes it in the sand. Jack reads the name Grýla out loud, and Grýla hears it. She possesses Tim's body to deliver a warning. Grýla believes naughty people don't fear Santa. She wants the world to be kinder. So, Grýla will go through the naughty list and punish anyone listed, no matter the offense. Grýla needs Santa's magic to complete her mission to force the world to be nice or else. Can Cal and Jack stop Grýla in time to save Christmas?<br/><br/>The visual effects are fun, but the humor falls flat. The script describes Jack as a level 4 naughty lister. He is a degenerate gambler with a stealing habit. Also, he's neglecting his son, Dylan. Cal surveys the world and sees angry, mean, and ungrateful adults. He's lost his wonder and doesn't think it will return. Cal and Jack must grow to save Santa, but it becomes boring. This film could be 30 minutes shorter and make the same point.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever",
    "review": "The small town of Emmanuel is abuzz because their 75th Annual Christmas Pageant is falling on Christmas Eve. But Beth Bradley doesn't feel the joy because the pageant hasn't changed. She attends Sunday school with her brother, Charlie. Their topic is 'why I love church.' Charlie tells the members he loves attending church because the Herdmans aren't there. The Herdmans are a family of kids that steal, smoke, start fires, and fight. The eldest, Imogene, leads her younger siblings - Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - as they terrorize the town.<br/><br/>Bob and Grace prepare their home for the holidays when they see flashing lights across the street. Grace and Beth spy the paramedics wheeling Mrs. Armstrong out because she broke her legs. Beth's friend, Alice, and Alice's mother, Rebecca, check on Mrs. Armstrong too. Grace mentions becoming acting director, but Rachel hints that Grace isn't up to Mrs. Armstrong's standards. Grace takes the job.<br/><br/>Two days in a row, the Herdmans stole Charlie's lunch. On the third day, Charlie gave it to them. Then, he bragged about receiving free food and snacks at church. When the Herdmans arrive at church, everyone stops and stares. The Herdmans sit with the students as Grace tells them about the play. Imogene wants to be Mary, her sister the Angel, and her brothers will be Joseph and the wise men. They threaten the other children to dominate the parts.<br/><br/>The parents meet Grace at Mrs. Armstrong's home. They demand Grace pull the Herdmans out of the play. Grace reminds them their kids didn't volunteer. She refuses to exclude the Herdmans and vows it will be the best pageant ever. But can she deliver?<br/><br/>Based on The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson, this film brings the children's classic to life. Fans of the book will recognize passages from the beloved tale and memorable scenes they imagined. The Herdman children are wild and have a tainted past with the townspeople. However, the Bradleys slowly see the changes in the children and the non-Christian behavior in the community. The same joy and faith you get from the book will ignite in the theater. The Herdmans aren't lost children. The community ignored them. This film is the perfect start to the holiday season and will become a classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Terrell wakes up in a panic from a nightmare. His wife, Aisha, can't take his night terrors. She wants him to work through his issues. Terrell goes into his studio and paints his pain on the canvas. Terrell's son, Jermaine, tells Terrell it's time for breakfast. Then, he calls his mother, Joyce, to check on her progress. Terrell will move Joyce out of her home and pay for a new place in two days. Joyce is unsure because she has good memories of her house, but Terrell convinces her the move will be good.<br/><br/>Terrell, Aisha, and Jermaine drive to Joyce's home, but she hasn't packed. Terrell and Aisha help Joyce box up her things until Terrell hears a looming voice. It's his father, La'Ron. Terrell grabs his family and heads for the door. Joyce stops Terrell and tells him that La'Ron isn't the same man. He's clean. Nevertheless, Terrell refuses to talk to La'Ron.<br/><br/>Terrell screams through another nightmare. He wakes up and punches a hole in the hotel wall. Aisha believes talking to La'Ron will help. He takes advice from Aisha and Joyce and meets with La'Ron. Terrell sets his camera on a tripod and starts recording. He asks La'Ron one question: When did you start using?<br/><br/>This movie displays generational pain and healing by asking one pivotal question. Terrell uses his art to express his torment, but it's not enough. First, La'Ron talks about his father-son relationship. Then, the audience experiences Terrell's horrors with a drug-addicted father and a loving mother. Terrell has difficult conversations and reflects on his parenting style. The movie's conclusion is honest, gut-wrenching, and heartfelt. It has beautiful artwork and emotional music. The title rings true, and this picture is worth seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

But you will re-watch it when it's on streaming.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Hope Goldman breathes while getting her makeup done for her interview on The Brett and Kylie show. Brett and Kylie ask Hope about her spa and upcoming skincare line. Hope gleams as she talks about her time in the business, her reputation, and creating the brand from Italian products.<br/><br/>Hope returns to her spa and pampers her clients while Margaret answers the phone. She looks outside and sees someone roaming the empty shop across the street. Hope packages a bag of her products and introduces herself to the new business owner.<br/><br/>Hope looks around the new shop in shock because it's another aesthetician, Angel. She grabs the goody bag and runs to her landlord, Jeff.<br/><br/>Jeff questions Hope about unpaid rent, but she dodges the question because her backer ran off with her money. Hope tells Jeff to get rid of Angel because it will ruin her business, but Jeff refuses. Furious, Hope leaves and greets her next appointment, Colleen. Colleen shows Hope her latest catch, Jordan.<br/><br/>After talking with a client, Hope sees Jordan sitting outside a coffee shop. She pulls him aside to talk and offers him skincare. Jordan is a life coach and hands Hope his card. Hope takes it and says good night.<br/><br/>Hope wakes up to creepy text messages and phone calls. Then, a client calls Hope and asks why she sent an email begging for money and intercourse to her entire address book. She runs to her shop, walks to the back, and screams. Someone hacked her. Margaret reminds Hope that her segment will be on today. Hope watches anxiously but sits stunned. They aired an interview that they filmed with Angel instead of hers.<br/><br/>Hope's day worsens as clients cancel and take their business to Angel. Hope walks to her car, in the Shimmer parking spot, and discovers someone slashed all her tires. Later, someone posts online solicitation ads with images of Hope. Hope calls the police after a man who saw the ad enters her spa and harasses her. Hope tells them Angel is her stalker. They take her statement and leave. This negative publicity will create a problem for Hope's Spa, and she fears it will affect her product launch in a week. Hope must handle Angel and put an end to his harassment now.<br/><br/>The audience should prepare themselves to watch a future cult classic. Viewers can easily decipher Hope's harasser. But remember, this film is a thriller, not a mystery. This fictional telling of actual events has many misguided characters manipulating each other. The backing track keeps tempo with the action and Hope's panic while the set designer ensures the technology is right for the time. This movie starts like a Lifetime film but is so much more. So watch and decide: who was wrong?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
