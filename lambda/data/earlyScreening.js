    "mtitle": "How to Train Your Dragon",
    "review": "Hiccup works as a blacksmith's apprentice in Gobber's shop, but he dreams of doing what all Vikings do: kill dragons. His father, Stoick, is the Chief of Berk. Hiccup begs to join during the battle, but Stoick and Gobber say no. Hiccup grabs his double-barreled, bolas-throwing weapon and sneaks off to the edge of the village. He thinks he sees the most feared dragon, the Night Fury, in the sky. Hiccup sees a flash in the night sky and fires his weapon. He sees the creature fall in the distance and cheers. However, another dragon spots Hiccup and attacks. Stoick saves him but forces Hiccup to go home.<br/><br/>Hiccup searches the woods and follows broken trees to a valley. He finds the Night Fury trapped in his bolas. Hiccup raises his knife to the creature, but won't take its life. He cuts the dragon free. It screams in Hiccup's face and runs away. Hiccup returns home and prepares to tell Stoick that he doesn't want to kill dragons. However, Gobber's wise words helped Stoick change his mind. He will allow Hiccup to train with Gobber to become a dragon slayer. Hiccup begrudgingly agrees.<br/><br/>Hiccup trains with Astrid, Snotlout, Fishlegs, and twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut. Astrid is the standout, while Hiccup is the outsider. Everything changes as Hiccup uses his private time with the Night Fury, named Toothless, to learn helpful hints about the dragons. However, Hiccup uncovers that Toothless and the other dragons are following the orders of something gargantuan. If humans and dragons don't work together, it will destroy them all.<br/><br/>This film is spectacular. If you put aside the controversy, this film is visually stunning. The CGI team and director worked diligently to create a smooth transition between live-action and computer-generated scenes. The astounding view could cause motion sickness for some audience members, especially if seen in 3D. This film expands the training elements and adds a few jokes, but the overall story is similar to the original movie. The downside of this picture is the sound editing. The actor's best lines become garbled during the massive battle scenes. This live-action reboot does the source material justice.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina",
    "review": "Eve listens to her ballerina music globe when her father, Javier, tells her to hide as they practice. She opens a secret door in the wall and looks through a slat to watch Javier. They put Javier on his knees as the Chancellor enters. He gives Javier two options. First, Javier can end his life, and they will take Eve. Or Javier can shoot the Chancellor, and the assassins will kill Javier and Eve. When Eve sees that Javier is losing, she comes from her hiding place, grabs the gun, notices the X etched in the killer's ankle, and shoots him. Javier and Eve make it out of their home alive, but Javier succumbs to his injuries.<br/><br/>Winston finds Eve and offers to take her to her family, the Ruska Roma. Eve meets the Director, and the Director sees Eve's pain. She allows Eve to stay, but Eve must follow the rules and train. Twelve years later, Eve dances with bloody feet, spars, and shoots under the tutelage of Nogi. One day, Eve hears fellow ballerinas whispering about the Baba Yaga, and she runs to the hallway to catch a glimpse of the legend. She wants to get out of training and into killing. John tells her to train harder but warns her to get out while she still can.<br/><br/>Eve impresses the Director and gets her first assignment. She succeeds and becomes a full-fledged member of the family. After finishing her latest contract, Eve collects her bounty, gathers her knives from corpses, and calmly exits the club. She gets in her car and drives away, but an assassin slams into her vehicle. Eve battles the killer and spots the X etched into his wrist. She cuts off his hand and brings it to the Director. The Director tells Eve that she will cause chaos by seeking revenge.<br/><br/>Eve travels to the Continental and gives Charon her gold coin. She wants to talk to Winston. The assassins aren't a tribe like the Ruska Roma. They are a cult. Eve demands their location, but Winston doesn't know where they are. He knows a member of the cult, Daniel Pine, is staying at another Continental. He gives Eve the location. Eve is on a mission to kill the man who murdered her father, and she will go against the Ruska Roma to do it.<br/><br/>This movie epitomizes cinematic beauty while following the John Wick format. The combat scenes have magnificent choreography. However, the editing is too jittery. Nonetheless, the enjoyable and unique battles play into Eve's strengths. You won't forget the flamethrower showdown. The film never sexualizes Eve. It's refreshing to see a dangerous woman complete a mission without secondary nonsense. This installment can grow, but it needs the proper writers, costume and set designers, and choreography. This film is better in IMAX.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Life of Chuck",
    "review": "Marty has a young man read Walt Whitman's Songs of Myself to the class, but no one pays attention because a part of California sank into the ocean after a 9.1 earthquake. Marty calls his ex-wife, nurse Felicia. Over the past few days, Marty has noticed signs around town thanking Chuck Krantz for his 39 years of service. Felicia heard Chuck's commercial on the radio. Neither of them knows who this man is or what he means to the town. Marty and Felicia discuss the cosmic calendar as they wait for the world's inevitable doom.<br/><br/>Taylor left Juilliard and now works in a record store. She plays drums on the street for spare change. One day, she sees Chuck walking down the street. She matches the beat to his stride. Chuck puts down his briefcase and starts to groove. After a profitable show, Taylor questions why Chuck stopped. He doesn't have an answer.<br/><br/>Chuck moved in with his grandparents after his parents and unborn sister died in a car crash. Three years later, Chuck's grandmother starts cooking again. She loves dancing to rock and roll while cooking. One day, she asks Chuck to join her. Chuck's grandparents have one rule: stay out of the conical. However, Chuck's curiosity gets the better of him, and he tries to open the door. His grandfather yells at Chuck, accidentally pushes Chuck down the steps, freezes in the doorway, grabs his arm, and shuts the door. He apologizes to Chuck and demands that Chuck take heed. Chuck has no idea what life has in store for him and the impact every person will make. It's time to witness Chuck.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by Steven King, this movie won't make sense until the end. The narrator tells the story of Chuck's life in three acts in reverse. In Act 3, the world is slowly falling apart. Pay attention to the poem, commercial, characters' speeches, and TV. The plot will revisit these themes during the first and second acts. Act two is the most lighthearted. Accountant Chuck chooses to enjoy the world around him and dance. Act one is the most honest and will connect the viewers with young Chuck. These formidable years have the most profound impact on Acts 2 and 3. This film is a mystical enigma surrounding an ordinary life. The Life of Chuck shows how beautiful yours can be when you choose to live it to the fullest.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Hurry Up Tomorrow",
    "review": "Abel goes through vocal exercises, lifts weights, and throws a few punches before going on stage. His manager, Lee, feeds his ego. Abel performs in front of a sold-out stadium. Later, Lee takes Abel to an otolaryngologist because Abel lost his ability to sing multiple times. The doctor doesn't see nodules and suspects Abel has Muscle Tension Dysphonia. Abel summarizes that his MTD started after his breakup and begs Lee to call his ex-girlfriend. Lee caves and puts the call on speaker. She never picks up.<br/><br/>Abel breaks down backstage and repeatedly calls his ex-girlfriend. Abel tells Lee to cancel his concert as he cries. Lee pumps Abel up with aggressive words of encouragement, reminders of their past, and drugs. Abel steps on stage and performs. However, his voice starts to crack. Abel looks in the crowd, locks eyes with Anima, and runs off stage. Abel packs his backpack and slips out to escape Lee.<br/><br/>Anima exits her house in tears and lights it on fire. She travels to see Abel in concert and watches him falter in front of fans. Out of concern, she jumps the barricade and sneaks backstage. He remembers her from the crowd and invites Anima to spend the evening with him. She says yes. Abel believes this moment is for the night and will continue his tour tomorrow. However, Anima has other plans. She will force him to come to terms with his life, choices, and music. She will make him pay if he doesn't.<br/><br/>Inspired by Hurry Up Tomorrow by The Weeknd, this movie symbolizes The Weeknd's music career and personal life. The film starts in a 4:3 ratio with a long tracking shot. This dynamic gives the audience a feeling of rationality. Opposed to Anima's following scenes with the burning house. The ratio changes to 16:9 with several cuts. Then, the ratio switches when Abel reaches a realization during his torture. Viewers must enter this movie with the understanding that they are entering The Weeknd's mind. Without that understanding, you will spend the entire movie asking for the plot with an urge to buy the album.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Fight or Flight",
    "review": "Agent Aaron Hunter curses as he enters headquarters. Someone slaughtered their team in Bangkok and escaped. They unveiled that the killer was The Ghost, a legendary black hat hacker. Hunter chastises his subordinates as his boss, Agent Katherine Brunt, enters. Before Hunter speaks, a team member discovers altered video footage hiding The Ghost's identity. The Ghost will board a flight to San Francisco. However, they don't have any mercenaries close enough to Bangkok to board a plane to identify and apprehend The Ghost. Brunt dials her only option.<br/><br/>Lucas Reyes stumbles into a bar and asks for another drink. His phone rings, and he immediately hangs up. Brunt calls again and pleads with Lucas to listen. She promises to reinstate him if he completes the mission. Lucas agrees with a few fists and dead bodies.<br/><br/>Before the flight, flight attendant Garrett briefs the team on today's passengers. Flight attendants Isha and Royce share a quip before boarding the passengers. Lucas makes pleasantries with the crew, sits, and updates Brunt in a text.<br/><br/>Agent Kyle Robinson requests to speak privately to Brunt and Hunter at headquarters. They enter a secure office, and Robinson tells them an unfortunate update. Someone alerted the world's most violent criminals that The Ghost was on that plane. The plane is littered with killers hunting the Ghost. They alert Lucas. Can Lucas unmask and apprehend the Ghost before someone kills them?<br/><br/>This movie, like Love Hurts and Novocaine, is funny and action-packed from the beginning to the end. The writers created an unserious action film. The weapons, battles, and alliances are outlandish. The film does have a strong lesson, but the writers didn't wallow in the message. The choreography focused on new fight elements, blood, and drugs to keep the audience engaged. However, the editing is clumsy. The ending invites a potential part two. However, one is enough for this future cult classic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
