    "review":"Showgirls Shelly, Mary-Anne, and Jodie run on stage to finish their performance. After the show, Shelly and her best friend, waitress Annette, go to the grocery store. Shelly met a guy in the parking lot, and he asked her to dinner. Shelly's excited until he calls and cancels while she's checking out. Shelly decides to buy the groceries and have an impromptu girls' night. She invites Mary-Anne, Jodie, and their producer, Eddie.<br/><br/>Everyone enjoys Shelly's cooking until Eddie drops by with sad news. He heard they are ending The Razzle Dazzle show. Shelly can't believe it because The Razzle Dazzle has been on the Las Vegas strip for 30 years. None of the women believe Eddie until they go to work in the morning. Eddie announces over the loudspeaker as they get dressed. The Razzle Dazzle will end in two weeks. Now, Shelly has to determine how to live out of the spotlight.<br/><br/>Shelly spins out of control as her world crashes around her. She fears the future while clinging on to the past. Shelly attempts to reconnect with her ex-boyfriend and daughter. They give her the same advice: move on. However, Shelly pushes them away and praises the show's heyday. Also, Shelly contemplates and faces everything she gave up to be on stage. It's sad to watch her spiral and get hit with a harsh dose of reality, but she needs it. The actors did an amazing job of highlighting these performers and the pitfalls of their work. This movie has an independent film conclusion but will make you think about your career. You won't buy the film, but it's wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Wicked",
    "review": "Galinda glides across the sky to announce the death of the Wicked Witch of the West. The people of Munchkinland rejoice because the 'wicked' shall never be mourned. Someone asks if the witch was born wicked. Galinda explains that Elphaba wasn't always evil.<br/><br/>Elphaba's father, Frexspar Thropp, was the Governor of Munchkinland. He loved his wife, Melena, dearly. However, she would drink elixirs and have affairs. One day, Melena gave birth to a baby, but everyone in the room took a step back. The baby was green. Objects in the room darted toward the ceiling as Frexspar demanded the midwife take the baby away. Years later, Frexspar and Melena had another child, Nessarose. He dotes on Nessarose but despises Elphaba. She dreams of the day she can meet the Wizard. Elphaba hopes he can change the color of her skin.<br/><br/>Galinda recreates her bubble to float away when a teen asks another question. The teen asks if the rumor about her and Elphaba being friends is true. Galinda says they were friends but corrects herself and says their paths crossed at school. She thinks back on that time.<br/><br/>Galinda arrived at Shiz University and quickly brushed off her parents. She prances into the courtyard and gathers everyone's attention. Madame Morrible, Head Mistress of Shiz, introduces herself to the students and states that she sees great things for some of them. Galinda runs over to Madame and asks if Madame will teach her sorcery seminar. Madame won't teach it unless there is an exemplary student.<br/><br/>Frexspar arrives with Nessarose and Elphaba. Nessarose can't wait to start school. Frexspar tries to push her chair, but Nessarose and Elphaba insist Nessarose doesn't need help. Someone grabs Nessarose's chair in an attempt to be helpful, and Elphaba causes things to rise and forces Nessarose back to her. Madame takes credit for the disruption, but Galinda sees the truth. This moment will lead to a fleeting friendship between Elphaba and Galinda, the dark history of Oz, the Wizard, the famous road, and flying monkeys.<br/><br/>Director Jon M. Chu knows how to bring a stage play to theaters. He separated the play into two movies to maintain the story's quality and its beautiful performances. Fans will lose themselves in the world of Oz and Shiz University as the sets shine on the screen. And there are several easter eggs for Wizard of Oz fans. Also, keep your eye open for surprise guests. You will cheer and be moved to tears as Elphaba sings her pain and pride. The songs leave the audience in awe, but some dialogue gets lost. However, seeing Wicked in the theaters is a new and fun experience.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Cal surveys the area while Santa Claus talks to children at the mall. Christmas is in less than 48 hours, and Santa wants to prep with exercise. Mrs. Claus counts his reps and gingerly walks towards the door when Cal enters, holding an envelope. Cal is the Captain of Santa's security team, ELF, but wants to resign. Santa sadly accepts Cal's resignation and asks Cal to stay on until the final run. Cal agrees. He reminisces on a bridge and sees lights flicker in the distance. When the anomaly continues, Cal questions if anyone has eyes on Santa. He runs to Santa's bedroom when no one sees him. Cal sees someone driving away with Santa. Cal chases them but loses Santa.<br/><br/>The director of MORA, Zoe, has a video call to get an update from Cal. Cal informs Zoe that a team broke through the North Pole cloaking device and kidnapped Santa. Agent Garcia checked the dark web and discovered someone stole equipment to test seismic activity. People in the underworld call the person The Wolf. The Wolf's real name is Jack.<br/><br/>They find Jack in his apartment, but he fights back. Zoe stuns Jack and ties him to a chair. She orders her soldiers to box Jack up and take him to the North Pole. Zoe will double Jack's fee if he tracks the client. Jack accepts.<br/><br/>Cal and Jack locate the client, Tim, a mercenary. Tim is too afraid to say the name and writes it in the sand. Jack reads the name Grýla out loud, and Grýla hears it. She possesses Tim's body to deliver a warning. Grýla believes naughty people don't fear Santa. She wants the world to be kinder. So, Grýla will go through the naughty list and punish anyone listed, no matter the offense. Grýla needs Santa's magic to complete her mission to force the world to be nice or else. Can Cal and Jack stop Grýla in time to save Christmas?<br/><br/>The visual effects are fun, but the humor falls flat. The script describes Jack as a level 4 naughty lister. He is a degenerate gambler with a stealing habit. Also, he's neglecting his son, Dylan. Cal surveys the world and sees angry, mean, and ungrateful adults. He's lost his wonder and doesn't think it will return. Cal and Jack must grow to save Santa, but it becomes boring. This film could be 30 minutes shorter and make the same point.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever",
    "review": "The small town of Emmanuel is abuzz because their 75th Annual Christmas Pageant is falling on Christmas Eve. But Beth Bradley doesn't feel the joy because the pageant hasn't changed. She attends Sunday school with her brother, Charlie. Their topic is 'why I love church.' Charlie tells the members he loves attending church because the Herdmans aren't there. The Herdmans are a family of kids that steal, smoke, start fires, and fight. The eldest, Imogene, leads her younger siblings - Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - as they terrorize the town.<br/><br/>Bob and Grace prepare their home for the holidays when they see flashing lights across the street. Grace and Beth spy the paramedics wheeling Mrs. Armstrong out because she broke her legs. Beth's friend, Alice, and Alice's mother, Rebecca, check on Mrs. Armstrong too. Grace mentions becoming acting director, but Rachel hints that Grace isn't up to Mrs. Armstrong's standards. Grace takes the job.<br/><br/>Two days in a row, the Herdmans stole Charlie's lunch. On the third day, Charlie gave it to them. Then, he bragged about receiving free food and snacks at church. When the Herdmans arrive at church, everyone stops and stares. The Herdmans sit with the students as Grace tells them about the play. Imogene wants to be Mary, her sister the Angel, and her brothers will be Joseph and the wise men. They threaten the other children to dominate the parts.<br/><br/>The parents meet Grace at Mrs. Armstrong's home. They demand Grace pull the Herdmans out of the play. Grace reminds them their kids didn't volunteer. She refuses to exclude the Herdmans and vows it will be the best pageant ever. But can she deliver?<br/><br/>Based on The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson, this film brings the children's classic to life. Fans of the book will recognize passages from the beloved tale and memorable scenes they imagined. The Herdman children are wild and have a tainted past with the townspeople. However, the Bradleys slowly see the changes in the children and the non-Christian behavior in the community. The same joy and faith you get from the book will ignite in the theater. The Herdmans aren't lost children. The community ignored them. This film is the perfect start to the holiday season and will become a classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Terrell wakes up in a panic from a nightmare. His wife, Aisha, can't take his night terrors. She wants him to work through his issues. Terrell goes into his studio and paints his pain on the canvas. Terrell's son, Jermaine, tells Terrell it's time for breakfast. Then, he calls his mother, Joyce, to check on her progress. Terrell will move Joyce out of her home and pay for a new place in two days. Joyce is unsure because she has good memories of her house, but Terrell convinces her the move will be good.<br/><br/>Terrell, Aisha, and Jermaine drive to Joyce's home, but she hasn't packed. Terrell and Aisha help Joyce box up her things until Terrell hears a looming voice. It's his father, La'Ron. Terrell grabs his family and heads for the door. Joyce stops Terrell and tells him that La'Ron isn't the same man. He's clean. Nevertheless, Terrell refuses to talk to La'Ron.<br/><br/>Terrell screams through another nightmare. He wakes up and punches a hole in the hotel wall. Aisha believes talking to La'Ron will help. He takes advice from Aisha and Joyce and meets with La'Ron. Terrell sets his camera on a tripod and starts recording. He asks La'Ron one question: When did you start using?<br/><br/>This movie displays generational pain and healing by asking one pivotal question. Terrell uses his art to express his torment, but it's not enough. First, La'Ron talks about his father-son relationship. Then, the audience experiences Terrell's horrors with a drug-addicted father and a loving mother. Terrell has difficult conversations and reflects on his parenting style. The movie's conclusion is honest, gut-wrenching, and heartfelt. It has beautiful artwork and emotional music. The title rings true, and this picture is worth seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
