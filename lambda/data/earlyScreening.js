    "mtitle": "The Bikeriders",
    "review": "Danny Lyon sat with Kathy in 1965 and interviewed her for his photobook about the Vandals outlaw biker gang. Kathy talks about love, the wives and girlfriends, and the changes in the group. Then, Danny asks Kathy about the day she met Benny. Kathy takes a long pull from her cigarette and recalls that night. Her friend didn't have enough money for her bar tab, so she asked Kathy to bring some. Kathy walked inside, wearing white jeans and a purple cardigan, instantly feeling out of place. After a few Vandals made passes at Kathy, she got up to leave and saw Benny. Benny is taciturn, so Kathy flees for the door. She sees Benny get on his bike and jumps on the back. Five weeks later, Benny and Kathy got married.<br/><br/>Then, Danny asks Kathy about Benny's club, the Vandals. Kathy sighs and explains the gang started as a riding club. After watching The Wild One, the leader, Johnny, wants to change it into a motorcycle club. Cal was Johnny's 2nd in command, but Johnny noticed something special in Benny. Kathy believes Johnny is jealous of Benny's carefree attitude towards life. When Benny gets injured after a fight, Johnny asks Benny to a club picnic, risking Benny's health. Kathy storms into the club and demands that Johnny tell Benny not to come. However, Johnny refuses. Johnny and Kathy fight for Benny. Who will Benny choose?<br/><br/>Inspired by The Bikeriders by Danny Lyon, this movie presents itself as Goodfellas with motorcycles. But it's not. The film doesn't delve into the underbelly of the club's illegal activities because those didn't start until after the old guard left. Instead, the plot is about two people fighting over someone. Kathy wants Benny to be safe, but Johnny desires Benny's freedom within the club. Also, the backing track follows Kathy's emotions instead of the hard-nosed club. This movie isn't the crime thriller you expect but is a power struggle between Kathy and Johnny.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Thelma",
    "review": "Thelma spends quality time with her grandson, Daniel. He gives her lessons about checking email before leaving. Then, Daniel pleads with Thelma to wear her monitor so he knows when she falls.<br/><br/>Thelma goes through her day when she gets a phone call from an unknown number. It's Daniel saying he is in jail for hitting a pregnant woman with his car. As Daniel begs for help, the officer beeps in on the other line. Thelma switches over. The officer says Thelma needs to send $10,000 to an address via mail. She attempts to call Daniel, but the call doesn't go through, solidifying her fears. She calls her daughter, Gail, but Gail's phone is on silent while she works with patients. Next, Thelma tries to connect to her son-in-law, Alan, but he doesn't pick up either. Thelma runs to the mailbox and drops the money inside.<br/><br/>After several tries, Daniel finally picks up. He's not in jail but asleep. The call was a scam. Gail, Alan, Daniel, and Thelma go to the police, but the police can't do anything. Feeling defeated, Thelma and her family return to Thelma's home. Thelma sits in her living room and overhears her family discussing her erratic behavior. Gail and Alan believe Thelma should move to an assisted living facility. Later, Thelma wakes up and decides to get her money back. Thelma will prove she can live alone. She will need a scooter, gun, and friend.<br/><br/>Thelma is a grandma on a mission, a Mission: Impossible. As the audience watches Thelma hijack a scooter, stake out a post office box, and start an explosion, you believe she's doing it for money. However, it's to keep her independence. Thelma insists on retrieving the money alone, but it becomes selfishness. Her friend, Ben, calls Thelma out on her behavior but won't give up on her. Your heart will ache during Thelma's lows, but you will have a hearty laugh during her highs. This film is for comedy and action fans with tenderness. You won't desire to buy it but it's worth seeing on the big screen. And don't leave before the mid-credit scene.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Babes",
    "review": "Best friends Dawn and Eden celebrate their annual Thanksgiving tradition of going to the movies. Before the movie starts, Dawn's water breaks. Dawn gives birth to a baby girl and requests sushi. Before Marty leaves, Eden offers to get it. When Eden returns, Dawn and her family are fast asleep.<br/><br/>The hospital won't let Eden store the sushi in their fridge, so she takes it on the train and starts to eat. Her first train has an emergency disembark. She quickly gathers her food, and Claude keeps the doors open to give her time to pack. They sit, eat, and joke. Eden wants to be intimate, but she alerts Claude that she's on her period. Eden remembers that neither of them had unprotected sex before, so they throw caution to the wind and sleep together without a condom.<br/><br/>It's almost New Year's Eve, and Eden hasn't heard from Claude. She calls Dawn to see if Dawn can get away from her family and hang out. Eden and Dawn get high on mushrooms. Eden's paranoia makes her take two pregnancy tests, and both are positive. Eden recalls she and Claude went to the same STI testing clinic. The administrators tell her that Claude died the day after Thanksgiving. Eden decides to have the baby, and Dawn vows to be by her side every step of the way. Motherhood will be the ultimate test of their friendship.<br/><br/>It's been a while since an audience laughed this hard. Dawn and Eden have no filters and share everything. Dawn tries to balance motherhood and work but feels like a failure. And her low milk production worsens the situation. Also, Eden has to come to grips with single parenthood. When Dawn doesn't show up for her as Eden did, Eden is understandably hurt. Don't expect an antagonist in this film because both women have a valid point and a fault in the argument. It will easily be a contender for the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Fall Guy",
    "review": "Colt Seavers is Tom Ryders's #1 stunt double. He is dating camera operator Jody Moreno. Gail, Tom's producer, pulls Colt aside because Tom wants Colt to reshoot the fall. Colt talks to Jody on the walkie-talkie while he goes to the top floor. Colt jumps but doesn't get back up. He hit the floor and broke his back.<br/><br/>Eighteen months later, Colt is a valet at a restaurant. Jody attempted to remain in the relationship, but Colt pushed her away. Colt gets a call from Gail because they are filming Metal Storm in Sydney. It's Jody's first movie, and she requested Colt be Tom's stunt double.<br/><br/>Colt arrives and meets with his friend Danny, the stunt coordinator. Colt inquires about Jody, but no one gives him an update. Colt performs a record-breaking roll but hits Jody's camera. He cooly walks her way, and Jody is dumbfounded. Gail lied, but it's too late to change. After setting Colt on fire several times, Jody gets Colt to admit his mistakes, but they decide to keep it professional.<br/><br/>Colt walks to Gail's trailer for an explanation. Gail confesses she hired Colt because Tom is missing. She wants Colt to go to Tom's loft, find Tom, and return Tom to set. If Tom isn't back in 48 hours, the studio will stop the film, and Jody will lose her first directing job. Colt wants to save Jody's movie and their relationship. Can he do it without dying?<br/><br/>Based loosely on The Fall Guy TV series, this movie is a victim of poorly executed trailers. It's an action-packed mystery with an epic love story. The film pays homage to the stunt people who stay in the background while the actor gets the glory. Novice movie-goers will see how stunt coordinators set up larger-than-life stunts with cables, fire, and VFX. Also, the director explained the nuance of a cut scene while having the actors perform it and mirror the other's movements. Forget the ads and watch this highly entertaining movie with action, mystery, fun, and love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
