    "mtitle": "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever",
    "review": "The small town of Emmanuel is abuzz because their 75th Annual Christmas Pageant is falling on Christmas Eve. But Beth Bradley doesn't feel the joy because the pageant hasn't changed. She attends Sunday school with her brother, Charlie. Their topic is 'why I love church.' Charlie tells the members he loves attending church because the Herdmans aren't there. The Herdmans are a family of kids that steal, smoke, start fires, and fight. The eldest, Imogene, leads her younger siblings - Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - as they terrorize the town.<br/><br/>Bob and Grace prepare their home for the holidays when they see flashing lights across the street. Grace and Beth spy the paramedics wheeling Mrs. Armstrong out because she broke her legs. Beth's friend, Alice, and Alice's mother, Rebecca, check on Mrs. Armstrong too. Grace mentions becoming acting director, but Rachel hints that Grace isn't up to Mrs. Armstrong's standards. Grace takes the job.<br/><br/>Two days in a row, the Herdmans stole Charlie's lunch. On the third day, Charlie gave it to them. Then, he bragged about receiving free food and snacks at church. When the Herdmans arrive at church, everyone stops and stares. The Herdmans sit with the students as Grace tells them about the play. Imogene wants to be Mary, her sister the Angel, and her brothers will be Joseph and the wise men. They threaten the other children to dominate the parts.<br/><br/>The parents meet Grace at Mrs. Armstrong's home. They demand Grace pull the Herdmans out of the play. Grace reminds them their kids didn't volunteer. She refuses to exclude the Herdmans and vows it will be the best pageant ever. But can she deliver?<br/><br/>Based on The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson, this film brings the children's classic to life. Fans of the book will recognize passages from the beloved tale and memorable scenes they imagined. The Herdman children are wild and have a tainted past with the townspeople. However, the Bradleys slowly see the changes in the children and the non-Christian behavior in the community. The same joy and faith you get from the book will ignite in the theater. The Herdmans aren't lost children. The community ignored them. This film is the perfect start to the holiday season and will become a classic.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Terrell wakes up in a panic from a nightmare. His wife, Aisha, can't take his night terrors. She wants him to work through his issues. Terrell goes into his studio and paints his pain on the canvas. Terrell's son, Jermaine, tells Terrell it's time for breakfast. Then, he calls his mother, Joyce, to check on her progress. Terrell will move Joyce out of her home and pay for a new place in two days. Joyce is unsure because she has good memories of her house, but Terrell convinces her the move will be good.<br/><br/>Terrell, Aisha, and Jermaine drive to Joyce's home, but she hasn't packed. Terrell and Aisha help Joyce box up her things until Terrell hears a looming voice. It's his father, La'Ron. Terrell grabs his family and heads for the door. Joyce stops Terrell and tells him that La'Ron isn't the same man. He's clean. Nevertheless, Terrell refuses to talk to La'Ron.<br/><br/>Terrell screams through another nightmare. He wakes up and punches a hole in the hotel wall. Aisha believes talking to La'Ron will help. He takes advice from Aisha and Joyce and meets with La'Ron. Terrell sets his camera on a tripod and starts recording. He asks La'Ron one question: When did you start using?<br/><br/>This movie displays generational pain and healing by asking one pivotal question. Terrell uses his art to express his torment, but it's not enough. First, La'Ron talks about his father-son relationship. Then, the audience experiences Terrell's horrors with a drug-addicted father and a loving mother. Terrell has difficult conversations and reflects on his parenting style. The movie's conclusion is honest, gut-wrenching, and heartfelt. It has beautiful artwork and emotional music. The title rings true, and this picture is worth seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Skincare",
    "review": "Hope Goldman breathes while getting her makeup done for her interview on The Brett and Kylie show. Brett and Kylie ask Hope about her spa and upcoming skincare line. Hope gleams as she talks about her time in the business, her reputation, and creating the brand from Italian products.<br/><br/>Hope returns to her spa and pampers her clients while Margaret answers the phone. She looks outside and sees someone roaming the empty shop across the street. Hope packages a bag of her products and introduces herself to the new business owner.<br/><br/>Hope looks around the new shop in shock because it's another aesthetician, Angel. She grabs the goody bag and runs to her landlord, Jeff.<br/><br/>Jeff questions Hope about unpaid rent, but she dodges the question because her backer ran off with her money. Hope tells Jeff to get rid of Angel because it will ruin her business, but Jeff refuses. Furious, Hope leaves and greets her next appointment, Colleen. Colleen shows Hope her latest catch, Jordan.<br/><br/>After talking with a client, Hope sees Jordan sitting outside a coffee shop. She pulls him aside to talk and offers him skincare. Jordan is a life coach and hands Hope his card. Hope takes it and says good night.<br/><br/>Hope wakes up to creepy text messages and phone calls. Then, a client calls Hope and asks why she sent an email begging for money and intercourse to her entire address book. She runs to her shop, walks to the back, and screams. Someone hacked her. Margaret reminds Hope that her segment will be on today. Hope watches anxiously but sits stunned. They aired an interview that they filmed with Angel instead of hers.<br/><br/>Hope's day worsens as clients cancel and take their business to Angel. Hope walks to her car, in the Shimmer parking spot, and discovers someone slashed all her tires. Later, someone posts online solicitation ads with images of Hope. Hope calls the police after a man who saw the ad enters her spa and harasses her. Hope tells them Angel is her stalker. They take her statement and leave. This negative publicity will create a problem for Hope's Spa, and she fears it will affect her product launch in a week. Hope must handle Angel and put an end to his harassment now.<br/><br/>The audience should prepare themselves to watch a future cult classic. Viewers can easily decipher Hope's harasser. But remember, this film is a thriller, not a mystery. This fictional telling of actual events has many misguided characters manipulating each other. The backing track keeps tempo with the action and Hope's panic while the set designer ensures the technology is right for the time. This movie starts like a Lifetime film but is so much more. So watch and decide: who was wrong?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The Retribution Through the Arts, also called RTA, finishes its production of Midsummer. John 'Divine G' Whitfield, a member of the RTA steering committee, meets with the other actors to discuss adding another member to the group. They ponder a few possibilities and choose Clarence 'Divine Eye' Maclin. G thinks Eye will make a great actor and persuades Eye to give the RTA a chance.<br/><br/>Eye sits for the first RTA meeting as the group discusses what play to do next. G has been working on a play called Fineprint. He gives everyone a synopsis. They like it, but Eye wants something different. Eye thinks their plays are too serious, and the people need to laugh, especially in Sing Sing Maximum Security Penitentiary. He proposes they try a comedy. G asks their director, Brent, to give it a shot. They want a Western, Roman, and Egyptian comedy with time traveling and Freddy Kruger. The group laughs, and Brent exits with their ideas.<br/><br/>Brent gives the group a script called Breaking the Mummy's Code with all their requests. Each member reads the script and auditions for the role that speaks to them. Eye informs G that he is auditioning for Hamlet and gets the part after nailing the performance.<br/><br/>The group meets after Brent assigns roles and completes a few acting exercises. G can feel Eye's apprehension and pulls Eye aside. G points out the shiv in Eye's waistband. G demands Eye never bring it to class because a violent act could shut down the program. G has a clemency hearing, while Eye has an appointment with the parole board. These men must lean on each other and the group to put on a stellar performance while their freedom hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Based on Sing Sing Follies by John H. Richardson, the movie opens with a cast under bright theater lights. Then, the correction officers enter to take the actors to their cell. The juxtaposition is startling. The RTA allows the group to discuss their feelings, hardships, and dreams in a safe environment. An excellent writing choice was to introduce the characters before their crimes. It allows the audience to see them as humans first. Viewers see parts of the play during a dress rehearsal, and it doesn't disappoint. If you expect a gritty, violent movie about prison life, this isn't your film. This film is a charming piece about a program that gives men a voice for their emotions and returns their humanity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
