    "review":"Ruby and Gretia stand in line to sign up for electives.  When Ruby hears her crush, Miles, signing up for choir, she does too.  On the first day of practice, Mr. Bernardo has each of the kids sing to sort them into their respective ranges.  When Ruby has her turn, she runs out of class.  When she goes home, she sees her parents, Jackie and Frank, arguing about money. The next day, Ruby summons the courage to sing for Mr. Bernardo.  He believes she has a unique talent that requires nurturing.  And with guidance, she could use her voice to get into Berklee College of Music. When Ruby comes home to tell Jackie, Ruby gets an unexpected response.<br/><br/>Jackie believes Ruby joined the choir as a sign of teenage rebellion against Jackie, Frank, and Ruby's brother, Leo.  Ruby is a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults, and is the only hearing-abled person in her family. When she works on the fishing boat with Leo and Frank, she fishes and interprets radio calls.  She has translated for them since she was a young child, and they enormously depend on her to help them communicate with other fisherpeople, the townspeople, fish auctioneers, and doctors. When Ruby and Leo feel like the auctioneers cheat them, Leo tries to persuade Frank to start a co-op, but he won't do it. But as the government steps in, it's too much for Frank to take and afford.  He decides to start the co-op with his family.  As the family needs her more than ever, can Ruby fulfill her singing dreams without destroying the family's new business?<br/><br/>This coming-of-age film is unlike any other because Ruby dealt with adult issues long before she was a teenager.  Leo, the eldest sibling, feels like their parents treat him like a baby because he can't hear.  Jackie and Frank need her because they can't afford an interpreter.  Ruby is a teenager that wants to shake off the adult responsibilities she deals with every day. Watching Ruby and her family grow will bring a tear to your eye and make you want to learn how to sign.  It will move you as Ruby shows her pride for her family while singing 'Both Sides, Now.'  A poignant song for the turning point in this film and Ruby's family.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Twenty years ago, a young boy lived in a safe house with his father. Men came into the home and surrounded the father.  The leader gave the father a pair of dice and made the father roll his fate.  The role landed on snake eyes. The young boy hid in the woods and heard the terrifying sound of a gunshot.<br/><br/>Now, the young boy is an adult that fights in underground battles under the name Snake Eyes. After watching Snake Eyes win, Kenta approaches Snake Eyes about joining his crew.  Snake Eyes plans to leave, but Kenta promises to find the man that killed his dad.  Four weeks later, Snake Eyes works at Kenta's docks, hiding guns in gutted fish.  One day, Kenta pulls Snake Eyes off the line to deal with a traitor, and the traitor is Kenta's cousin Tommy, the leader of the Arashikage Clan.  Snake Eyes sees honor in Tommy and refuses to shoot. Later, Snake Eyes wakes up on a private jet with Tommy headed to Tokyo.  Since Snake Eyes saved his life, Tommy will give Snake Eyes a home and a chance to join his clan. Sen agrees to let the outsider take the three tests, but if Snake Eyes fails, he will die.  During the test, Tommy unveils Kenta's new plan to ship weapons. He, Snake Eyes, and Akiko infiltrate Kenta's hideout and find the guns.  The Cobra logo is on the boxes, which floors Tommy.  Tommy tells Snake Eyes that Cobra is a terrorist organization, and Snake Eyes can't believe it.<br/><br/>After a day of training, Snake Eyes takes Tommy's motorcycle and goes to an underground bunker.  There, Kenta waits for Snake Eyes and his intel about the Arashikage.  However, Snake Eyes is furious because he never knew Kenta worked with Cobra.  Snake Eyes wants no part of terrorism, but the Baroness has other plans.  She comes out of the shadows and tells Snake Eyes that she has his father's killer stashed away.  Snake Eyes has three days to execute Kenta's plan, or she will let his father's killer go.  Kenta wants Snake Eyes to break into the Arashikage's vault and steal the Jewel of the Sun, a weapon. Once Kenta gets his revenge on the Arashikage, Kenta will give it to the Baroness and make Cobra the deadliest force in the world.<br/><br/>This movie blends eye-popping action, spellbinding storytelling, and worthwhile lessons in two hours without boring the audience, relying on a love story, or unnecessary male or female sexualization.  While it doesn't follow the comic to the letter, this film is more enjoyable than the other G.I. Joe movies.  While this movie has such blaring positive aspects, the backing track causes the dialog to become garbled. IMAX and 3D are not necessary to enjoy this film, but Dolby can help.  And stay past the first set of end credits but not to the end.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Four years after COVID-19, COVID-23 is airborne, affects the brain, and causes rapid death.  Anyone without an immunity bracelet must stay inside at all times and do a 9 a.m. health scan with their phone.  If they fail the scan, the sanitation department comes to their door with armed guards and escorts them to the Q Zone, also known as the quick death zone.  Some would consider Nico one of the lucky few because he has an immunity bracelet. During the worldwide lockdown, he met Sara. Sara lives with her grandmother and sees people pulled away by Emmett and the sanitation department all the time. On the other side of town, Piper and William raise their daughter, Emma.  While they are immuned, Emma has a weak immune system and could get sick with ease. To make money, Piper and William sell black market immunity bracelets to powerful and wealthy people.  As Piper takes every precaution, William leaves in a suit and breathing mask to meet his mistress, May.  May sings online under the handle MayDay, and people watch and donate money. Their intertwined lives will come to a deadly end when someone gets sick and fails a health check.  They will need an immunity bracelet or die in the Q Zone.<br/><br/>While setting the current pandemic four years in the future, this movie is a mix between Crash and Mission Impossible.  This movie does cover a lot of topics like immuned people passing a disease, disease mutation, and proper quarantine techniques. However, at the core of this movie are three love stories and one obsession story.  The pandemic causes and affects each of these stories.  Seeing the satisfyingly bloody end will entice you to keep watching.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Alice sits on a bed and reads a story to her children about her childhood.  Years ago, Alice had two brothers, Peter and David.  The children love to play in the woods a pretend to have sword fights, throw arrows, and battle pirates. Their mother, Rose, gives Alice a tinker's bell.  She tells Alice she can summon fairies with it. David is the smartest of the three children and never wants to grow up.  Peter, like his father, Jack, is an excellent carver.  Without Jack's knowledge, Eleanor enrolled David in boarding school.  Before David can converse with Rose about the matter, Rose explains that she has accepted Eleanor's offer.  All three children are upset David is leaving. David and Peter went into the woods to play, and David slipped into the water and drowned. Amid his pain, Jack goes to the local underground casino and creates a massive debt.  CJ wants his money tonight, and Jack writes an IOU on a napkin.  He goes home and believes he is even with CJ.  But, someone throws a brick through Jack's window with the napkin attached.  Alice and Peter take it upon themselves to help their dad.  They have no idea the wheels they will set in motion, linking their father's past, their imagination, and divided futures.<br/><br/>Based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie, this isn't the tale you know.  It's the tale of how Peter and Alice came to be.  One event gave Alice and Peter the same pain, but they handled it in different ways. With the intertwining stories, it's the special effects merging the children's fantasies with their reality that will make you do a double-take.  It's reminiscent of Rugrats. Sit back and enjoy with children six and up.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
