    "review": "I Can Only Imagine is still MercyMe's biggest hit. While on tour, Bart gets a call from his wife, Shannon. Their son, Sam, won't wake up. After Sam wakes, doctors tell Bart and Shannon that Sam has Type 1 Diabetes. Insulin will be Sam's lifeline. Bart gives Sam his first shot. When Sam says it hurts, Bart flashes back to his abuse and runs. Then, he gets a staunch reminder that this is their new normal, or they will lose Sam.<br/><br/>Ten years later, Tim gets the message he has been waiting for his entire life. Scott wants him to tour with MercyMe. This will be Tim's first tour. He tells his wife, Hilary, the wonderful news. Hilary sees the X on Tim's wrist. Tim draws it every morning. He invites her to join in, but her commitment isn't there yet. Tim brings his guitar, unfinished song, and favorite book.<br/><br/>MercyMe still tours, but their biggest hit is losing its luster. They look to Bart to write another song, but he has writer's block. MercyMe's manager, Scott, calls the band into the studio. Their headliner wants to spend time at home. So MercyMe will be the main act on the tour. Tim will open for them. Bart is happy to be on tour, but he feels that Sam needs him more. Sam ignores his health. Bart tells Scott his troubles and blurts out that Sam should come on the road with them. Scott agrees. Bart says he will only allow it if Shannon does. He assumes she would say no, but surprisingly, she agrees. This road trip will help Bart understand the balance of grievance and gratitude.<br/><br/>This sequel is better than the first with an original story and song. It follows the true story of Tim and Bart. Tim helps Bart see that ups and downs can be used to strengthen one's belief. Tim is fulfilling his dream while keeping a secret. This movie about men counseling each other without swearing, violence, or inappropriate innuendos is a breath of fresh air in this market. They listen to each other, acknowledge their feelings, and confess their fears. They become blood brothers. The emotions and conversations are raw and heartwarming. Viewers won't have a deeper discussion after the film, but you will feel lighter and seen.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Mercy",
    "review": "Lawlessness broke out in Los Angeles after widespread job loss, homelessness, and addiction. The Mercy Court was introduced. It is judge, jury, and executioner. Everyone is guilty until proven innocent. They have 90 minutes to use all the information at the AI's disposal to prove their innocence. They are considered innocent if their guilt rating falls below a threshold of 92.5%. Detective Chris Raven and Jacqueline Diallo advocated for the new system, praising its results. Since its implementation, crime has reduced to 68%. The Mercy court has tried 18 cases, ending in executions.<br/><br/>Chris wakes up from a drunken stupor to these facts as Mercy Courts' commercial plays. He realizes he's tied to a chair. Judge Maddox, an AI humanoid presence, greets him and requests that he exhale. The AI detects that the alcohol in Chris's bloodstream has reduced to an acceptable level. He can stand trial for the murder of his wife, Nicole. The AI believes he's 97.5% guilty. It plays the security and ring cam video as evidence. He went to work but left early and drove to Nicole's home. He rang the doorbell and demanded she let him inside. Twenty-eight minutes later, Chris left the home. Later, their daughter, Britt, arrived home after a sleepover and discovered Nicole's body. After a battle, the police apprehended him and brought him to Mercy Court. With the facts of the case in front of him, Judge Maddox asks Chris to enter his plea. Chris says he's innocent. Maddox tells Chris that all her information is at his disposal. He has 90 minutes to prove someone else committed the crime or die. Will Chris survive?<br/><br/>You can not be late for this film. The twist ending won't make sense without seeing the beginning. The plot capitalizes on people's fears about AI in every aspect of society. While that's the base of the movie, it's a mystery with a ticking clock that drives the story. You feel the pressure as Chris sifts through calls, emails, and bank records. Also, he's dealing with the human aspect. He has to prove to Britt and his colleagues that he's not guilty to obtain their help. The plot gives you tidbits of the truth, and like Chris, you will overlook them the first time. That's what makes this picture so intriguing. The hoverbike scenes' graphics aren't well done, but the exciting chase makes up for it. The story perfectly balances its action, mystery, and emotions. This film deserves a second watch. However, IMAX is enough. 3D isn't necessary.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "Wicked: For Good",
    "review": "Ms. Morrible announces to the Ozians that Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, still has the Glimmerie. She warns them not to trust Elphaba or the animals. They want to harm the Wizard. She enters Glinda's home with a new mode of transportation from the Wizard. Since Elphaba can fly, they need their symbol of good to be airborne also. Morrible tells Glinda to be ready to become a beacon of encouragement for the Ozians.<br/><br/>Glinda floats as Morrible tells the crowd that she is Glinda the Good Witch. Then, the Chief of the Gale Force, Prince Fiyero, enters with his men. Morrible tells the Ozians that they are engaged. He sighs and agrees to wed her. Then, Elphaba flies through the sky and writes, 'Our Wizard Lies.' Before the people can see it, Morrible changes it to 'Wizard Dies.' She tells them that Elphaba wants to kill the Wizard. To Glinda's regret, the Ozians hate Elphaba.<br/><br/>Nessarose took over her father's role as governor after his passing. The Wizard wants her to sign a decree to ban all animals. However, Boq begs her not to do it. Later, he sees the flyer advertising Glinda's wedding. He ends his relationship with Nessarose and runs for the train. However, it's too late. Nessarose signed a law banning animals and Munchkins from leaving Munchkinland. She forces Boq to work for her.<br/><br/>Elphaba finds the remaining animals in the forest. They found an underground passage, under the yellow brick road that leads them outside of Oz. She begs them to stay because the area outside is vastly empty. She promises to make Oz safe for them again. They will only feel secure when she dies. This truth breaks Elphaba's heart as they leave.<br/><br/>Glinda cries after a betrayal. Morrible fumes at Elphaba for ruining her spectacle. She and the Wizard consider ways of making Elphaba pay. Glinda tells them to create a rumor about Nessarose. Elphaba will come to her rescue. Morrible says Elphaba is too smart to fall for a rumor. They need a change of weather. One cyclone will create the legend of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good. Now, you will know the truth behind it all.<br/><br/>This remarkable feat of music, lighting, acting, fun, and drama will leave you stunned and thoroughly entertained. The director used the first movie to introduce the audience to the characters and their backstory. This next film contains passion, rage, propaganda, and a twist. The colors jump off the screen, and the vanity department finds new ways to incorporate the leads' signature hues. The juxtaposition of Elphaba walking down an aisle of cages with Glinda walking down the aisle will amaze you and break your heart. And let's not forget the slaps heard around the world. Without dominating the plot, the writers seamlessly wove the Wizard of Oz film with this story. This picture is a must-see on the biggest screen and the best sound.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Threesome",
    "review": "Connor stares at Olivia from the bar. Connor's friend, Greg, warns Connor that there is a small difference between lurking and stalking. Connor and Olivia have always been friends, but they had sex one time. Since then, Greg can feel the attraction between them, but Olivia denies it. Greg encourages him to talk to a girl, Jenny, sitting at a few tables over. It will make Olivia jealous. Olivia sees her ex-romantic partner, Kevin, with his wife. He's upset that she ghosted him, and Olivia's upset that Kevin is married. She walks away and sees Connor with Jenny. She convinces Jenny to go dancing with him. Olivia tells Connor that Jenny would be okay with a threesome, and they go back to his place. To Connor's surprise, Olivia is right.<br/><br/>Connor wakes up to Jenny in his bed, but Olivia is gone. Jenny and Connor spend time in the shower before she leaves. Connor walks to Olivia's favorite café. They decide to have their first date. Weeks later, Connor and Olivia are a happy couple. Connor enters the bathroom to brush his teeth and finds a positive pregnancy test in the trash can. They decide to have the baby.<br/><br/>Connor and Olivia return home and find Jenny on their doorstep. She sullenly informs them that she's pregnant with Connor's baby too. She will keep her baby and is determined to do it alone if necessary. Olivia leaves. She refused to involve herself in Connor's drama. Olivia ends their blossoming relationship. She chooses not to keep her baby and runs to Kevin's home. Can Connor handle this wild circumstance when Olivia decides to keep their baby?<br/><br/>These three characters, Olivia, Connor, and Jenny, are some of the most insufferable people ever written. Connor is a masochist who caves at the slightest whimper from Olivia and Jenny. Olivia is a narcissistic, indecisive, bottomless pit of need. Jenny, the youngest of the bunch, is the most mature. She lies to her parents about the situation and keeps waiting for the 'right time' to come clean. The saving grace of this movie is the comedic relief of Greg. He is the audience's reaction and happily inserts himself in any situation. He loves the tea. Two camera angles stick out. First, Connor and Olivia discuss the pregnancy test. Connor faces the camera, while you can see Olivia in a reflection of the mirror. They are in the same room but with different perspectives. The next is when Connor learns a devastating secret. The angle slightly turns as he processes the information. This film is uncomfortably funny and charming. However, you may strongly dislike the conclusion.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
