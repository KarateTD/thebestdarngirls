    "review":"Terrell wakes up in a panic from a nightmare. His wife, Aisha, can't take his night terrors. She wants him to work through his issues. Terrell goes into his studio and paints his pain on the canvas. Terrell's son, Jermaine, tells Terrell it's time for breakfast. Then, he calls his mother, Joyce, to check on her progress. Terrell will move Joyce out of her home and pay for a new place in two days. Joyce is unsure because she has good memories of her house, but Terrell convinces her the move will be good.<br/><br/>Terrell, Aisha, and Jermaine drive to Joyce's home, but she hasn't packed. Terrell and Aisha help Joyce box up her things until Terrell hears a looming voice. It's his father, La'Ron. Terrell grabs his family and heads for the door. Joyce stops Terrell and tells him that La'Ron isn't the same man. He's clean. Nevertheless, Terrell refuses to talk to La'Ron.<br/><br/>Terrell screams through another nightmare. He wakes up and punches a hole in the hotel wall. Aisha believes talking to La'Ron will help. He takes advice from Aisha and Joyce and meets with La'Ron. Terrell sets his camera on a tripod and starts recording. He asks La'Ron one question: When did you start using?<br/><br/>This movie displays generational pain and healing by asking one pivotal question. Terrell uses his art to express his torment, but it's not enough. First, La'Ron talks about his father-son relationship. Then, the audience experiences Terrell's horrors with a drug-addicted father and a loving mother. Terrell has difficult conversations and reflects on his parenting style. The movie's conclusion is honest, gut-wrenching, and heartfelt. It has beautiful artwork and emotional music. The title rings true, and this picture is worth seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Elliott ignores calls from her family on her 18th birthday because she decided to go camping with her friends, Ruthie and Ro. Ro got some mushrooms.

She introduces herself as 39-year-old Elliott. Elder Elliott tells her younger self they are on the PH.D track and to stay away from anyone named Chad. After younger Elliott falls asleep, elder Elliott grabs her younger's phone and enters her phone number.<br/><br/>Younger Elliott wakes and envies her friends' drug-fueled trips. She floats in the water until a guy jumps out. He greets her and says his name is Chad. Elliott freaks out, says she's Ray Romano, and leaves.

Her elder reminds Elliott to be nice to her brothers, spend time with her mom, and stay away from Chad. She can do two of them, but they all lead to love, change, and acceptance.<br/><br/>Elliott is in the phase of her life where she is young and dumb. She doesn't see the beauty in the world around her because she is too busy looking ahead. Her older self reminds her to spend time with her loved ones, enjoy the lake, and moisturize.

But you will re-watch it when it's on streaming.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "John wakes from his 90-day hibernation. After his hibernation, the system warns John that he will experience confusion, nausea, dizziness, and disorientation. He and his crew, Captain Franks and Nash, have two more sleep cycles before their mission. They will travel to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere denser than the Earth and considered 'planet-like.' However, their ship, Odyssey, will need a 'gravity assist' to complete the mission. They will use Jupiter to slingshot toward Titan. Captain Franks, John, and Nash go through their system checks, work out, eat, and have psych evaluations before going into their next hibernation.<br/><br/>John opens his chamber and hears noises above his head. He assumes it's a hallucination until the screws fall, and a piece of the ceiling hits him. John sees Captain Franks and Nash standing above him when he rouses. John climbs into the opening and sees a massive buckle in the ship. They test the internal system, and it passes the checks. Nash believes something is wrong, and the system checks are false positives. He asks John to readjust his hibernation schedule. They will wake up 12 hours before the mission and use the 'gravity assist' to push them toward Earth. John obliges but has stipulations. They must run the checks first. If everything is fine, they will go to Titan. Otherwise, Earth will be their destination.<br/><br/>Captain Franks calls Nash and John to his quarters. He overheard Nash's plan. Captain Franks believes Nash's hibernation shots are negatively impacting his sanity. John pretends to agree but sets his hibernation pod to wake up early. However, he is seeing and hearing things on the ship. He isn't sure who to follow. Will they make it to Titan without losing their minds, or will they return to Earth as failures?<br/><br/>Fans of the sci-fi thriller genre will guess the twist in this film. You are correct and wrong at the same time. The writers used your knowledge of the category to create several twists. This film is unintentionally funny and provides a few jump scares. The plot slows when John goes into hibernation. He dreams about meeting and starting a relationship with Zoe. This film creates red herrings among the clues to lead you down a false rabbit hole. You won't know who to trust, either. You must see this and judge for yourself. Did you guess the ending?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Hope Goldman breathes while getting her makeup done for her interview on The Brett and Kylie show. Brett and Kylie ask Hope about her spa and upcoming skincare line. Hope gleams as she talks about her time in the business, her reputation, and creating the brand from Italian products.<br/><br/>Hope returns to her spa and pampers her clients while Margaret answers the phone. She looks outside and sees someone roaming the empty shop across the street. Hope packages a bag of her products and introduces herself to the new business owner.<br/><br/>Hope looks around the new shop in shock because it's another aesthetician, Angel. She grabs the goody bag and runs to her landlord, Jeff.<br/><br/>Jeff questions Hope about unpaid rent, but she dodges the question because her backer ran off with her money. Hope tells Jeff to get rid of Angel because it will ruin her business, but Jeff refuses. Furious, Hope leaves and greets her next appointment, Colleen. Colleen shows Hope her latest catch, Jordan.<br/><br/>After talking with a client, Hope sees Jordan sitting outside a coffee shop. She pulls him aside to talk and offers him skincare. Jordan is a life coach and hands Hope his card. Hope takes it and says good night.<br/><br/>Hope wakes up to creepy text messages and phone calls. Then, a client calls Hope and asks why she sent an email begging for money and intercourse to her entire address book. She runs to her shop, walks to the back, and screams. Someone hacked her. Margaret reminds Hope that her segment will be on today. Hope watches anxiously but sits stunned. They aired an interview that they filmed with Angel instead of hers.<br/><br/>Hope's day worsens as clients cancel and take their business to Angel. Hope walks to her car, in the Shimmer parking spot, and discovers someone slashed all her tires. Later, someone posts online solicitation ads with images of Hope. Hope calls the police after a man who saw the ad enters her spa and harasses her. Hope tells them Angel is her stalker. They take her statement and leave. This negative publicity will create a problem for Hope's Spa, and she fears it will affect her product launch in a week. Hope must handle Angel and put an end to his harassment now.<br/><br/>The audience should prepare themselves to watch a future cult classic. Viewers can easily decipher Hope's harasser. But remember, this film is a thriller, not a mystery. This fictional telling of actual events has many misguided characters manipulating each other. The backing track keeps tempo with the action and Hope's panic while the set designer ensures the technology is right for the time. This movie starts like a Lifetime film but is so much more. So watch and decide: who was wrong?<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "The Retribution Through the Arts, also called RTA, finishes its production of Midsummer. John 'Divine G' Whitfield, a member of the RTA steering committee, meets with the other actors to discuss adding another member to the group. They ponder a few possibilities and choose Clarence 'Divine Eye' Maclin. G thinks Eye will make a great actor and persuades Eye to give the RTA a chance.<br/><br/>Eye sits for the first RTA meeting as the group discusses what play to do next. G has been working on a play called Fineprint. He gives everyone a synopsis. They like it, but Eye wants something different. Eye thinks their plays are too serious, and the people need to laugh, especially in Sing Sing Maximum Security Penitentiary. He proposes they try a comedy. G asks their director, Brent, to give it a shot. They want a Western, Roman, and Egyptian comedy with time traveling and Freddy Kruger. The group laughs, and Brent exits with their ideas.<br/><br/>Brent gives the group a script called Breaking the Mummy's Code with all their requests. Each member reads the script and auditions for the role that speaks to them. Eye informs G that he is auditioning for Hamlet and gets the part after nailing the performance.<br/><br/>The group meets after Brent assigns roles and completes a few acting exercises. G can feel Eye's apprehension and pulls Eye aside. G points out the shiv in Eye's waistband. G demands Eye never bring it to class because a violent act could shut down the program. G has a clemency hearing, while Eye has an appointment with the parole board. These men must lean on each other and the group to put on a stellar performance while their freedom hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Based on Sing Sing Follies by John H. Richardson, the movie opens with a cast under bright theater lights. Then, the correction officers enter to take the actors to their cell. The juxtaposition is startling. The RTA allows the group to discuss their feelings, hardships, and dreams in a safe environment. An excellent writing choice was to introduce the characters before their crimes. It allows the audience to see them as humans first. Viewers see parts of the play during a dress rehearsal, and it doesn't disappoint. If you expect a gritty, violent movie about prison life, this isn't your film. This film is a charming piece about a program that gives men a voice for their emotions and returns their humanity.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
