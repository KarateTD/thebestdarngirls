    "review":"Agent Aaron Hunter curses as he enters headquarters. Someone slaughtered their team in Bangkok and escaped. They unveiled that the killer was The Ghost, a legendary black hat hacker. Hunter chastises his subordinates as his boss, Agent Katherine Brunt, enters. Before Hunter speaks, a team member discovers altered video footage hiding The Ghost's identity. The Ghost will board a flight to San Francisco. However, they don't have any mercenaries close enough to Bangkok to board a plane to identify and apprehend The Ghost. Brunt dials her only option.<br/><br/>Lucas Reyes stumbles into a bar and asks for another drink. His phone rings, and he immediately hangs up. Brunt calls again and pleads with Lucas to listen. She promises to reinstate him if he completes the mission. Lucas agrees with a few fists and dead bodies.<br/><br/>Before the flight, flight attendant Garrett briefs the team on today's passengers. Flight attendants Isha and Royce share a quip before boarding the passengers. Lucas makes pleasantries with the crew, sits, and updates Brunt in a text.<br/><br/>Agent Kyle Robinson requests to speak privately to Brunt and Hunter at headquarters. They enter a secure office, and Robinson tells them an unfortunate update. Someone alerted the world's most violent criminals that The Ghost was on that plane. The plane is littered with killers hunting the Ghost. They alert Lucas. Can Lucas unmask and apprehend the Ghost before someone kills them?<br/><br/>This movie, like Love Hurts and Novocaine, is funny and action-packed from the beginning to the end. The writers created an unserious action film. The weapons, battles, and alliances are outlandish. The film does have a strong lesson, but the writers didn't wallow in the message. The choreography focused on new fight elements, blood, and drugs to keep the audience engaged. However, the editing is clumsy. The ending invites a potential part two. However, one is enough for this future cult classic.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle": "The Accountant 2",
    "review": "Former Treasury Director Raymond King meets Anaïs in a pub. Ray shows her a picture of a family and points to the boy. Ray tells her that a man, Emiliano, hired him to find his daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, Alberto. He warns her to be careful, but she tells Ray that people are following him. Ray looks around the room and sees several men moving in the shadows. He runs to the bathroom, but the window won't budge. He hides in the stall while writing a message on his arm. He manages to escape the pub, but a sniper shoots him in the street.<br/><br/>Newly appointed Treasury Director Marybeth enters her office at FinCEN and answers the phone. It's the medical examiner's office. A detective on Ray's case asks Marybeth if Ray has financial issues. Marybeth doesn't recall and wonders what caused the detective to question Ray's spending habits. The detective pulls down the sheet covering Ray's body and exposes his arm. He has 'Find the Accountant' scrolled on it.<br/><br/>Marybeth travels to Ray's rented home and finds marks on a blank wall. The owners removed the gruesome photos he displayed. She pays the rent and makes a murder board. She can't decipher the information and finds a business card for Harbor Neuroscience Academy. She calls the number and assumes the British voice, Justine, is eavesdropping. Marybeth informs the receiver that Ray is dead and that she needs the accountant, Christian Wolff.<br/><br/>Christian arrives at Marybeth's location and watches her review the evidence. He uncovered that each murder follows the family in the photo. If they want to discover who killed the victims, they must find the family. However, they will need more boots on the ground because Marybeth refuses to do anything illegal. So, Christian calls his brother Braxton.<br/><br/>Braxton is finishing a job overseas when his phone rings. Christian wants to know if Braxton can be in Los Angeles in 24 hours. They will use their talents to uncover a dark world ruled by greed and find a missing family.<br/><br/>This sequel was worth the wait. It expands the world while allowing Christian Wolff to grow. He and Braxton have a loving bond, but Braxton wants a deeper connection to his big brother. The hand-to-hand combat is perfectly choreographed, framed, and edited. The shootouts are more elaborate and farfetched, but the film is so good you won't care. Also, the audience gets to see what happens at the Academy. It's fun, brilliant, and shocking. This series will be the next John Wick if writing and action rise steadily.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Violet ends her counseling session with her client on a high note. She dresses for her date, Henry, and lets her sister, Jen, inside to watch her son, Toby. Violet changes and drives to Palate Restaurant.<br/><br/>Violet arrives before Henry, who texted that he will be 10 minutes late, and asks the hostess to seat her at the bar. Violet bumps into a man, Connor, and she drops her phone. The bartender, Cara, takes Violet's order while a man, Richard, calls Violet Diane. Violet corrects him, and he flusters. Violet and Richard converse until Phil steps between them. Cara apologizes because Phil is their new piano player. Then, someone airdrops Violet a weird image, warning that she will have the worst date of her life. Violet ignores the images when Henry arrives with his camera bag because he doesn't want to leave it in the car. The hostess takes Henry and Violet to their table.<br/><br/>As their waiter, Matt, introduces himself, Violet gets more airdrops from someone called 'Let's Play.' She tells Henry, and he recalls that you must be within 50 feet to send a drop. He deduces that the prankster has to be in the restaurant. Violet gets a text that tells her to check her home's security camera. She sees a masked man holding a gun in her house. Then, 'Let's Play' warns Violet to keep calm. Violet plays along until the culprit wants her to do the unthinkable: kill Henry. Can Violet find who's 'Let's Play' and save Toby before she has to murder Henry?<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery wrapped in a thriller. The writer has to create suspense within the confines of the restaurant. And using Airdrop technology allows 'Let's Play' to be nearby. Anyone could be 'Let's Play.' The director shoots Violet at an angle where her world slips away anytime the culprit traps her in a corner. It's a visual representation of a trauma response. Moviegoers should sit closer to the screen if they have issues with their eyesight. A subplot is at play, but viewers won't care because the mystery steals their attention. This movie is for fans of Breaking In, Panic Room, or Phone Booth.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Nathan Caine is the assistant manager at San Diego Trust Bank. He prepares coffee over ice after helping his client, Earl, keep his store. Nate's crush, teller Sherry, says hello to Nate and scares him, causing Nate to spill scalding coffee on his hand. Sherry offers to buy Nate lunch. Nate says no until he thinks about Earl. Earl said time with his wife was priceless. Nate runs into the hallway and accepts Sherry's offer.<br/><br/>Sherry orders cherry pie while Nate gets a milkshake. She attempts to feed Nate pie, but he staunchly refuses. Nate doesn't eat solid foods because he has a genetic disorder called congenital insensitivity to pain. She thinks Nate has a superpower, but Nate explains that he could severely bite his tongue and never know it. Now, Nate takes every precaution to protect himself from accidents and infection. Sherry promises to care for him and convinces him to eat pie. Nate loves it, and she asks him out.<br/><br/>Nate meets Sherry at the bar, and she talks about her upbringing and being in recovery. Then, Nate's high school bully approaches with a punch and calls Nate Novocaine. Nate leaves for the bathroom and returns to see Sherry flirting with his bully. Sherry tells them to let the past go and celebrate with a drink. The bully and Nate take the shot, but the bully chokes. The shot was ghost pepper hot sauce. Nate and Sherry run out of the bar and to his home. They spend the night together.<br/><br/>Nate wakes with a new lease on life on Christmas Eve. Then, three bank robbers - Ben, André, and Simon - enter the bank dressed as Santa and order everyone on the ground. They grab Nate, but Nate stammers with fear as they hit him. Sherry begs the robbers to stop. They sadistically point the gun at Sherry, and Nate says the combination. The robbers grab the money, knock out Nate, and take Sherry as a hostage. Nate regains consciousness and runs outside. He saves a cop from exsanguination before stealing the cop's gun and car. He will risk it all to save Sherry and be her superhero. However, detectives Mincy and Coltraine believe Nate is working with the robbers. Can Nate save Sherry before the police arrest him?<br/><br/>Viewers should note that the movie states the seriousness of this rare condition after the credits. The film doesn't want to make light of a complex situation while using it for a plot point. This high-octane picture is similar to Crank. The film relies heavily on dark humor and grotesque violence to engage the audience, but it's fun. Viewers can figure out the twist, but the film offers more for the ending. Nate's condition separates this movie from others in its genre. Otherwise, this film is a mindless good time for anyone who loves action, dark humor, and gore and could grow into a franchise with the correct script.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "Showgirls Shelly, Mary-Anne, and Jodie run on stage to finish their performance. After the show, Shelly and her best friend, waitress Annette, go to the grocery store.

She invites Mary-Anne, Jodie, and their producer, Eddie.<br/><br/>Everyone enjoys Shelly's cooking until Eddie drops by with sad news. He heard they are ending The Razzle Dazzle show. Shelly can't believe it because The Razzle Dazzle has been on the Las Vegas strip for 30 years. None of the women believe Eddie until they go to work in the morning.

Now, Shelly has to determine how to live out of the spotlight.<br/><br/>Shelly spins out of control as her world crashes around her. She fears the future while clinging on to the past. Shelly attempts to reconnect with her ex-boyfriend and daughter. They give her the same advice: move on. However, Shelly pushes them away and praises the show's heyday. Also, Shelly contemplates and faces everything she gave up to be on stage. It's sad to watch her spiral and get hit with a harsh dose of reality, but she needs it. The actors did an amazing job of highlighting these performers and the pitfalls of their work. This movie has an independent film conclusion but will make you think about your career. You won't buy the film, but it's wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
