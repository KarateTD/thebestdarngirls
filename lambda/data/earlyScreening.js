    "review":"Best friends Dawn and Eden celebrate their annual Thanksgiving tradition of going to the movies. Before the movie starts, Dawn's water breaks. Dawn gives birth to a baby girl and requests sushi. Before Marty leaves, Eden offers to get it. When Eden returns, Dawn and her family are fast asleep.<br/><br/>The hospital won't let Eden store the sushi in their fridge, so she takes it on the train and starts to eat. Her first train has an emergency disembark. She quickly gathers her food, and Claude keeps the doors open to give her time to pack. They sit, eat, and joke. Eden wants to be intimate, but she alerts Claude that she's on her period. Eden remembers that neither of them had unprotected sex before, so they throw caution to the wind and sleep together without a condom.<br/><br/>It's almost New Year's Eve, and Eden hasn't heard from Claude. She calls Dawn to see if Dawn can get away from her family and hang out. Eden and Dawn get high on mushrooms. Eden's paranoia makes her take two pregnancy tests, and both are positive. Eden recalls she and Claude went to the same STI testing clinic. The administrators tell her that Claude died the day after Thanksgiving. Eden decides to have the baby, and Dawn vows to be by her side every step of the way. Motherhood will be the ultimate test of their friendship.<br/><br/>It's been a while since an audience laughed this hard. Dawn and Eden have no filters and share everything. Dawn tries to balance motherhood and work but feels like a failure. And her low milk production worsens the situation. Also, Eden has to come to grips with single parenthood. When Dawn doesn't show up for her as Eden did, Eden is understandably hurt. Don't expect an antagonist in this film because both women have a valid point and a fault in the argument. It will easily be a contender for the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"The Fall Guy",
    "review":"Colt Seavers is Tom Ryders's #1 stunt double. He is dating camera operator Jody Moreno. Gail, Tom's producer, pulls Colt aside because Tom wants Colt to reshoot the fall. Colt talks to Jody on the walkie-talkie while he goes to the top floor. Colt jumps but doesn't get back up. He hit the floor and broke his back.<br/><br/>Eighteen months later, Colt is a valet at a restaurant. Jody attempted to remain in the relationship, but Colt pushed her away. Colt gets a call from Gail because they are filming Metal Storm in Sydney. It's Jody's first movie, and she requested Colt be Tom's stunt double.<br/><br/>Colt arrives and meets with his friend Danny, the stunt coordinator. Colt inquires about Jody, but no one gives him an update. Colt performs a record-breaking roll but hits Jody's camera. He cooly walks her way, and Jody is dumbfounded. Gail lied, but it's too late to change. After setting Colt on fire several times, Jody gets Colt to admit his mistakes, but they decide to keep it professional.<br/><br/>Colt walks to Gail's trailer for an explanation. Gail confesses she hired Colt because Tom is missing. She wants Colt to go to Tom's loft, find Tom, and return Tom to set. If Tom isn't back in 48 hours, the studio will stop the film, and Jody will lose her first directing job. Colt wants to save Jody's movie and their relationship. Can he do it without dying?<br/><br/>Based loosely on The Fall Guy TV series, this movie is a victim of poorly executed trailers. It's an action-packed mystery with an epic love story. The film pays homage to the stunt people who stay in the background while the actor gets the glory. Novice movie-goers will see how stunt coordinators set up larger-than-life stunts with cables, fire, and VFX. Also, the director explained the nuance of a cut scene while having the actors perform it and mirror the other's movements. Forget the ads and watch this highly entertaining movie with action, mystery, fun, and love.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "mtitle":"Unsung Hero",
    "review":"Promoter David Smallbone brings worldwide musical acts to perform in Australia. He convinces his boss to strike a $200,000 deal with Amy Grant. His sell-out show prediction doesn't come to fruition. David comes home with the looming news over his head and gets a surprise birthday party. David and Helen's six children - Rebecca, Daniel, Ben, Joel, Luke, and Josh - sing and celebrate their dad. Then, Helen gives David a onesie with Smallbone written on the back. She is pregnant with their 7th child. David tries to keep a straight face, but Helen can see something isn't okay.<br/><br/>David confesses to Helen about losing his job the next day, but he has a plan. He calls singer Carman, and they decide to start a Christian music label. But, David needs to come to Nashville to start it. Helen worries but agrees. She gives David two years to start the label, or they must return home.<br/><br/>After days between planes, customs, and trains, The Smallbone family arrives in Nashville to a tiny, unfurnished home. Carman's record label found out about his deal with David and made Carman a counteroffer. Carman took it. David gives Helen the news, and she decides to enlighten the family. They are in a new country without a job, car, or furniture. She puts a jar with money in front of them. She tells them the money will grow and shrink with everyday bills, but they can't let it disappear. Then, they pray. Helen makes a wall of 'Pleases and Thank Yous.' One by one, the Smallbones pleases will become thank yous with the help of their faith, family, community, and one spectacular voice.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, this movie isn't solely about Rebecca and her rise to fame. It's about her family's perseverance and faith. Their 'Please and Thank You' wall helped them find the miracle in small things like coupons, a letter, and a playground. Career setbacks, illness, depression, and death threaten to bring down the family. Unfortunately, David's most unyielding obstacle is his pride. David must learn that family is the way. This faith-based movie will inspire you to write down your prayers and celebrate the miracles, big or small. And it will bring added attention to their organization Compassion International.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

    "review":"Patrick Zweig sleeps in his car because he can't afford a hotel room. An attendant asks Patrick to move, but Patrick is a player in the tennis tournament that afternoon. An employee checks Patrick in and slyly informs Patrick that a big-name star will be a wild card. When Patrick enquires about the person's name, the employee grabs a branded racket with Art Donaldson's face across it. Later, Patrick makes it to the final. He stands on the court and looks at his competitor, his ex-best friend Art, while his ex-girlfriend, Tashi Duncan, watches in the stands.<br/><br/>Days earlier, Coach Tashi evaluated Art's last match. If Art wants to make it to Wimbledon, he must qualify by winning a tournament. Art reassures his wife, Tashi, that he wants to be number one for them both. Tashi smiles and signs Art into the tournament. When the finals are between her ex-boyfriend, Patrick, and her husband, Art, Tashi sits and reflects on every choice over a decade ago that led them here.<br/><br/>Years ago, Art and Patrick played in doubles and singles. They laugh and watch the women's singles games. Tashi wows the crowd, and her gameplay captivates them. After her game, they met with Tashi and invited her to talk by the beach. She accepts. She will attend Stanford instead of going pro. She knows Art got accepted too. Patrick invites Tashi to their hotel room and promises beers. They have a three-way make-out session before Tashi heads for the door. They ask for her phone number. Tashi knows they will play against each other in the men's tournament tomorrow. She tells them she will give the winner her phone number. That game will follow them for the rest of their lives, careers, and friendships. Who is playing who?<br/><br/>This movie has as many moving parts as a tennis match. Viewers must pay attention because the timeline jumps from the present to 14 years ago to the present to 1 day ago to the present. Also, the backing track drowns out the dialogue during several scenes, making the script harder to follow. The cinematography decisions are outstanding, but one is dizzying. It makes the audience the ball in the final match. The characters are all cunning and unique, but tennis pulls them together. Tashi has one goal in life: to win. Patrick loves to be number one and sees Tashi as a prize. Art is a great player, but his insecurity shows. During the movie, each character attempts to manipulate the others to dominate. While this film needs more than one watch to keep up with the timeline, you won't desire to buy it when it comes out on DVD or Digital.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
