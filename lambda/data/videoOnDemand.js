		"review":"Sophie knocks on her boyfriend's classroom door to get his attention. Gordon exits the classroom. Sophie got a job interview for a Michelin-star chef's upcoming restaurant. Sophie knows the chef, Ruby, because Sophie worked as her sous chef for a few years before coming to New York. The interview is in Quebec, and they must cancel their trip upstate. Gordon considers the choice a no-brainer and tells Sophie to accept the interview.<br/><br/>Gordon runs to his father's house after school and asks his dad, Peter, for his family's heirloom wedding ring. He is ready to propose to Sophie and start their life as man and wife. Simultaneously, Sophie calls her family and informs them she is coming to town. They beam through the phone until they learn the job is with Ruby. They ask Sophie if she told Gordon the truth about their relationship, but she hasn't.<br/><br/>After a memorable flight, Gordon and Sophie land in Quebec, and Gordon shares awkward moments with her family. They sit for a family dinner and get to know each other better. Then, Ruby comes with a bottle of wine. Sophie informs her family she will tell Gordon about her past when the time is right.<br/><br/>Sophie leaves for her first day for her interview. Gordon takes this time to explore the family's home. He finds Sophie's old bedroom and looks around. Gordon discovers a scrapbook with S and R on the binder. He looks through it and finds an intimate Polaroid of Ruby and Sophie. Gordon runs to Sophie's brother, Junior, for advice. He says Ruby cheated on Sophie and broke Sophie's heart. Gordon thinks Ruby wants Sophie back, and the job is the bait. Gordon can see Ruby's deceitful ways, but can he convince Sophie?<br/><br/>This movie has standout points that will remind you of Bridesmaids, Meet the Flockers, and Weekend at Bernie's, but it's not a fresh idea. It only changes the interloper's gender. Sophie is an unassuming girlfriend with good intentions but secrets. Gordon is a kind but insecure boyfriend who bends backward to impress her family. Ruby is the arrogant past, putting on a false face. The studio made the correct choice by sending this picture to streaming.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Personal Assistant Lucy arranges the garland in Ryanna's archway before Ryanna's autograph signing. Ryanna rips into the room and says she wants the orange flowers changed to red. After a successful signing, Ryanna hands Lucy a signed copy of her book and talks about her needs for tomorrow. Lucy cuts Ryanna off and reminds Ryanna that today is Lucy's last day.<br/><br/>Lucy finds a note on her door from her neighbor, Gloria, inviting her to dinner. Gloria tells Lucy to have fun, work less, and find love. Lucy wants to focus on her new client, Prince Rupert. His business could launch Lucy's dream. Lucy wants to start a personal assistant company.<br/><br/>Lucy arrives at Rupert's home, but no one answers the front door. Lucy walks around the house and knocks over a dessert tray. She kneels to clean and hears a man offering assistance behind her. Then, it dawns on Lucy that she is speaking to Prince Rupert. Prince Rupert's courtier, James, points Lucy towards the bathroom so she can clean up.<br/><br/>Lucy sits for an interview with James, and Rupert enters the room to listen. James wants Lucy to maintain Rupert's schedule, throw the first annual masked ball, and help Rupert find a princess. Rupert hires Lucy, but James warns her she is on probation until the ball. Later, James tells Lucy not to fall for Rupert's charms or schemes. Lucy heeds his advice and prepares for Rupert. But is Rupert ready for her?<br/><br/>This movie has the model plot for a woman who meets a prince and falls in love. Its standouts are the princesses and the fairy godmother, Gloria. They bring the necessary comedy to this rom-com. Viewers will smile when Lucy stands up for herself after Rupert's ridiculous request. This picture is for fans of the Hallmark plot with a regal twist. And pay attention to the subplot because it's beautiful.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "One Fast Move",
		"review": "Wes has a high-speed chase with the police and spends time in prison. He loses his benefits after receiving a 'bad conduct' discharge from the military. A social worker offers Wes a construction certificate to work, but Wes doesn't want it. He only wants his bike.<br/><br/>Wes rides to a race track and finds Dean. He looks Dean in the eye and tells Dean his mother's name. Dean invites Wes for a beer at a local bar. Wes leaves, and Dean follows. Wes tells Dean he wants to race, but Dean doesn't think Wes is ready. He offers to tune up Wes's bike instead.<br/><br/>After thinking about it all night, Wes shows up at Legend's motorcycle shop. Dean introduces Wes to the owner, Coach Abel. Wes asks Dean to ride with him. They ride, but Wes makes a hot shot move that almost causes Dean to crash. Dean barrels toward Wes and demands an explanation because those moves ended Dean's career. Wes wants Dean to train him to race professionally. Dean agrees to train Wes to become a pro. But is Dean doing it for Wes or himself?<br/><br/>This film is an emotional rollercoaster, but it isn't captivating. The plot touches on the absent father-longing son dynamics with an elder guiding the way. Dean and Wes call the shots on the track, but Abel is the hero of this story. The subplot has a romance with Camila. However, the writers use it to stoke issues between Dean and Wes. This movie found the perfect platform but won't bring new Prime subscribers.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "My Spy: The Eternal City",
		"review": "JJ cares for 14-year-old Sophie while her mother, Kate, works in Rwanda. JJ is a whiz in the kitchen since giving up field work to care for Sophie. She goes to school and trains with JJ in the afternoon. However, Sophie doesn't appreciate JJ's hands-on approach. She reminds JJ that he may play dad but isn't her father.<br/><br/>JJ and Bobbi keep watch of Christina while Christina retrieves the location of handheld nuclear weapons. Christina gets the information, puts them on a thumb drive, and escapes before operative soldiers find her. David praises JJ for completing step one but wants JJ in the field for the next step. JJ won't break his pinky promise to nine-year-old Sophie and rejects the job.<br/><br/>Sophie sings in the school choir while mooning over the lead singer, Ryan. She dreams of asking him to the homecoming dance. Sophie asks her friend, Collin, for assistance and a confidence boost. Their choir director alerts the choir they are on the shortlist to sing at the G7 summit in Vatican City.<br/><br/>JJ trains Sophie, but she misses her backflip several times. She decides to leave, but JJ worries she's quitting. Then, Sophie gets a text from her choir director. They are going to Italy.<br/><br/>Before boarding the buses, Sophie gives JJ the rules for the trip. Then, Sophie and JJ watch David drop off his son, Collin. Collin doesn't know his dad heads the CIA. JJ vows to keep an eye on Collin for David. The new Vice Principal, Nancy, confronts JJ about his duties during the trip. He is a first-time chaperone, and she worries he is ill-prepared.<br/><br/>JJ gets a warning from the tripwire he installed in front of Ryan's door. He catches Ryan, Collin, and Sophie sneaking out of the hotel. JJ allows them to leave. But they must return before Vice Principal Nancy catches them. Sophie and Ryan are having a wonderful time together and take a selfie. During the picture, Sophie notices someone pull Collin into a van, and she chases after the kidnapper. A motorcyclist almost hits Sophie during her pursuit, but JJ saves her. JJ looks at Sophie's images and identifies the kidnapper as Bishop Crane. Bishop got the thumb drive from Christina. Now, Bishop's boss wants David to get the launch codes from a secure facility. If he doesn't, they will kill Collin. They need to save the world and Collin.<br/><br/>The sequel to My Spy navigates complicated relationships with a fun mystery, comical action sequences, and attack finches. JJ doesn't have a dreamy adolescent. She is a young woman trying to spread her wings. Bobbi and Sophie maintain their semi-hostile but respectable relationship during the mission. And the boss's reveal is surprising. This film builds on the original and brings back the characters you love. While watching the first film is unnecessary, the plot has two humorous callbacks to the original. This movie isn't for younger children, but you and your teens will laugh.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Descendants: The Rise of Red",
		"review": "Queen Mal and King Ben sail off with Jay and Evie to form alliances with distant lands. They made Uma headmaster of Auradon Prep and Fairy Godmother the President of Auradon University.

Before the guards capture her, Maddox Hatter saves her and brings her to his lab. Red wants to forge a path for herself. Then, Maddox shows Red his latest invention: a pocket watch time machine.

The Queen forces Red to decide his fate. Before coming up with something more horrendous, Uma's invitation arrives. To Red's surprise, the Queen accepts.<br/><br/>Princess Red, the Queen of Hearts, Cinderella, and Chloe arrive for orientation. Cinderella asks the Queen to let the past go and let love into her heart. Chloe asks Cinderella what happened. The Queen says that someone's played a cruel prank on her during Castlecoming, and she will never forgive them.<br/><br/>Headmaster Uma introduces herself to the parents, students, and faculty. However, Uma sees she doesn't have the Queen's attention. She asks the Queen to put her cards away. Then, the Queen throws them into the sky, and the cards transform into soldiers. Red realizes the Queen isn't their to enroll her but to stage a coup. Red begs her mother to stop. Red pleads with Cinderella to swear allegiance, but Cinderella won't. It's off with her head. Red grabs the pocket watch to time travel to take her mother's cards, and Chloe grasps her sword to battle the Queen. Red tries to stop Chloe and triggers the pocket watch. Everyone disappears.<br/><br/>Red and Chloe see a girl poorly practicing magic in the quad, saying 'bibbidi bobbidi boo.' They realize it's the teenage Fairy Godmother, now known as Fay.

Uliana's face transforms into a flamingo's head. She vows revenge on Bridget at Castlecoming. Red grasps they were sent back in time to stop the prank that changed her mom. Red and Chloe must stop Uliana to save Cinderella's life and Red's future.<br/><br/>Serving as the sequel to Beyond The Isle of the Lost by Melissa de la Cruz, this fourth installment of the Descendants franchise introduces new worlds, students, and villains while giving the audience a glimpse of the past. The opening sequence addresses the main characters' absence while paying homage to Cameron Boyce. Then, Red storms onto your screen with a song that will immerse you into the dark world of Wonderland. Chloe lives in King Charming's kingdom with rewards for goodness. Chloe, seeing Cinderella's teen angst and coldness, throws Chloe for a loop. While the storyline and the songs are flawless, you will want more to the story. The previous films had a twist. But this one film doesn't. This installment brings joy, songs, and lessons like its predecessors but feels half-done without the twist.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Tyler Perry's Divorce in the Black",
		"review": "Pastor Clarence preaches to Linda's surviving four sons at her eldest son's funeral.

It uses modern scenarios to freshen the storyline and increase the intensity. Ava is a pastor's daughter who doesn't want to disappoint her parents.

This movie has the believable ingredient missing from Tyler's latest projects. And the opening and final scenes will leave your jaw on the floor.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
