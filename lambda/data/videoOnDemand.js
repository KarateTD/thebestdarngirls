		"mtitle": "Turtles All The Way Down",
		"review": "Aza's therapist considers several forms of therapy after Aza admits to opening her callus again. Aza confesses to taking her medication sporadically but won't consider Exposure Response Therapy for her Contamination OCD. Aza eats lunch with her best friend, Daisy, at school but runs out of the cafeteria because she thinks her stomach is too loud. Aza furiously washes her hands, removes her band-aid, opens her callus, and puts soap into the wound. Her thoughts ease. Daisy plans to meet Aza after school at the most posh restaurant in town: Applebee's.<br/><br/>As they eat their burgers, Aza and Daisy overhear a news report about Russell Davis Pickett. Russell is a fugitive billionaire with several white-collar crimes to his name. He left his two sons, Davis and Noah, behind. The police issued a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Daisy remembers that Aza met Davis at a camp for children coping with loss. Aza remembers Davis got a web camera for his 13th birthday. They put it in a tree on his property. Daisy wants to sync to it and examine the photos for evidence.<br/><br/>Aza and Daisy find the camera and sync with it. However, a groundskeeper discovers them and brings them to the Pickett's home. Davis remembers Aza, and Daisy observes he's smitten. Daisy wants Aza to keep up the conversation with Davis. They can return to the belly of the beast, investigate Russell's disappearance, and receive the reward money. However, Aza worries about becoming close to Davis and potentially having his microbiome inside her. Can Daisy and Aza find Russell without Aza spiraling?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Turtles All The Way Down by John Green, this adaptation draws you into Aza's spiral while keeping her human. The script doesn't depict Aza as all-knowing or perfect. She has flaws, and her OCD impacts everyone around her. Later, Daisy's fan fiction feels harsh. But when Daisy questions Aza about her personal life, Aza flounders. It's a complex and necessary conversation for these friends and exposes the faults in their friendship. Also, viewers get a mystery. This film ends like most of John Green's books, with an honest, compelling, hopeful, and wholehearted conclusion. It will leave a mark and conversation for the audience.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Shirley",
		"review": "Shirley Chisholm joined the new class of the 91st Congress of the United States in 1968. She stands out because she is the 1st African American woman to achieve this goal. Representing New York's 12th district, Shirley wanted to encourage the marginalized to vote.<br/><br/>After a few years in Congress, Mac Holder and Arthur Hardwick Jr. visit Shirley and her husband, Conrad, with startling information. Shirley promised to put her name on the primary ballot if her Floridian staffers raised $5,000. Mac informs Shirley that they raised nearly $10,000. Arthur will handle finances, Conrad will cover security, and Mac will advise her. Shirley knows they are a formidable force. However, this is the first year people 18 to 20 can vote. So, Shirley hires her former intern, Robert Gottlieb, as her national student coordinator. Later, Shirley employs a young and unregistered Barbara Lee. Shirley's bold political moves will change California's voting landscape, media coverage, and the Democratic National Committee.<br/><br/>Shirley wanted the world to know she was more than an African American and more than a woman. She was proud of both things but never allowed it to become her only identity. She wanted to be a voice of people ignored by politicians. She refused to hear the word 'can't' and quickly learned political inner workings and backdoor dealings. She understood that making history was significant but not as much as change. By standing up for herself, Shirley proudly leveled the playing field for all. This film covers a few years of her life but beautifully embraces the impact she made.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Road House",
		"review": "Frankie walks to an underground fight club, looking for Carter. After watching Carter win, Frankie sees him quit after seeing his opponent, Dalton. Now, she eyes Dalton. She runs a roadhouse in Glass Keys, but lately, a local gang has harassed the establishment and patrons. She wants Dalton to keep the peace. Dalton says no, but Frankie writes down her phone number if he changes his mind later.<br/><br/>Dalton drives his car on the train tracks and waits. Dalton changes his mind before the train strikes, but the vehicle stalls. Dalton starts it in the nick of time and narrowly escapes death. He grabs Frankie's number on the dash and takes the job.<br/><br/>Dalton arrives in Glass Keys and visits the Road House. Soon, the local gang starts hitting patrons and breaking items inside. Dalton makes quick work of the goons and sends them to the hospital. He assumes he will never see them again. However, they work for Brandt, a shady land developer. The Road House is the only property standing in the way of his luxury housing development. Brandt puts a target on Dalton's back. Now, Dalton, the Road House, and the residents of Glass Keys are in danger. Can Dalton do the one thing he doesn't want to do again: kill?<br/><br/>This re-imaging of 1989's Road House keeps the humor and essence of Dalton's character. He doesn't want to fight unless necessary because 'No one wins in a fight.' While the film's heart is intact, the action scenes aren't smooth. The jump from live-action to computerized is evident and distracting. Dalton appears more like a superhero than a vigilante. This film is captivating for the action fanatic.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Ricky Stanicky",
		"review": "JT, Dean, and Wes celebrate Halloween like all kids do in 1999. They dress up, get candy, and play pranks. They place dog poop on the neighbor's porch, light it on fire, and run behind bushes to watch. However, the neighbors don't come out, and the fire grows. They try to put it out with a jacket but can't. They remove it and write 'Ricky Stanicky' on the collar. JT, Dean, and Wes get away with arson. Now, they want to blame everything on Ricky in the future to get out of trouble.<br/><br/>Today, Dean and his girlfriend, Erin, prepare for JT and Susan's baby shower. Then, Dean gets a message from Ricky. Ricky's cancer is back, and he wants his friends for support. Susan and Erin encourage Dean and JT to skip the baby shower and stand by Ricky's side while he gets surgery. Wes sent Ricky's texts from a secret phone. They turn off their phones and open their Ricky Bible on the flight. It documents all the lies so the men can keep track. They attend a concert and go to a bar for drinks. A man, Rod, slithers to the bar. They converse with Rod and discover he is an X-rated parody singer and actor working at a local club. Dean gets Rod's number, but JT blows Rod off. They turn on their phones and get a slew of text messages. Susan went into labor early, and Wes missed the baby's birth.<br/><br/>They arrive at the hospital, and Susan's mom, Leona, is furious at them and Ricky. Leona tells them to invite Ricky to the bris because he will be in town. The men feel trapped, but Dean offers a solution. He pulls Rod's business card from his pocket and gives Rod a call.<br/><br/>Rod leaves the stage, and someone warns Rod that two men are looking for him. Rod sees the goons in the audience and jumps out the window. He gets a call from Dean and accepts the job. Dean gives Rod the Ricky bible to study. They hope Rod will come to the party, shake hands, and leave forever. But what will they do when Rod wants to become Ricky?<br/><br/>It's unbelievable that these men kept the Ricky lie going for years. They have a phone and social media account for the Ricky persona. It's not until the lies affect their work and relationships that the men see the issue. Seeing the three men try to juggle their lives, the lie, Rod, and their relationships is a complicated but humorous balancing act. This movie has crass laughs but entertains. It will be a guilty pleasure for the Hangover crowd but not as memorable.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
