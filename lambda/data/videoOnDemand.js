		"review": "Plant Geneticist Dani works at Veredent Solutions with her mentor, owner Victoria. Victoria admires Dani's monogrammed pink latex gloves while watching a report on Marcus. Marcus worked at Acava Biopharmaceuticals, and someone murdered him during a home invasion. Dani offers to ask her finacé, Jordan, if he has ever encountered Marcus.<br/><br/>Dani meets Jordan at home after speaking to teens at a community center. He admits to never meeting Marcus but offers to ask around about him. Dani works late the next day, so Jordan makes her dinner and puts it in the fridge. She tells him to exclude anything spicy. Dani takes the meal to work and chokes after drinking Jordan's punch. He put pepper in it. Dani texts Jordan that she is going to kill him. Then, Dani informs Victoria that Jordan promised to question co-workers about Marcus.<br/><br/>Dani arrives at home but chooses not to go through the front door. She wants to retaliate and prank Jordan. She finds him on the floor, foaming at the mouth, and calls 911.<br/><br/>Detective Nadine and Lance interview Dani, but they don't believe her story about the intruder because there wasn't forced entry. They arrest Dani after discovering her text message threatening to kill him and bring her to the station. Dani panics when they question her with mounting evidence. Someone set her up to take the fall. But she must figure out who and why. So, Dani escapes police custody. Can she find Jordan's killer before the police find her?<br/><br/>This mystery allows the audience to know the killer without the motive. It circles back to every insignificant conversation. The recap happens quickly, so viewers must pay attention. The fight scenes are a bit overdramatic. The quips and fights will cause you to laugh more than worry about Dani's safety. The plot is far-fetched, but the film is an entertaining enigma.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Soul of a Sister",
		"review": "It's been fifteen years since Nyna worked in the studio. She loved singing and was on her way to stardom until a producer, Von, assaulted her. Now, Nyna does drugs, works as a bottle girl, and sells her body for money. Her saving grace is her daughter, Lizzy. Nyna asks her friend, Tamara, to watch Lizzy. She works at the bar and considers going home with a man, but changes her mind to spend more time with Lizzy. Nyna walks to the subway station.<br/><br/>Darin Blackstone, head of Blackstone Records, and musical artist Vito arrive at the rehab center to pick up Darin's brother, producer Jesse. Jesse went into a downward spiral after their father died. He jumps into the vehicle to run from reporters and rides to the record label. Darin gives Jesse his first artist, Rizzy Ray. Jesse listens to her raps and hates them. Darin loves Rizzy because she has over a million followers. Jesse wants to relax at home after a long night in the studio. Vito offers to give Jesse a ride, but Jesse chooses the train.<br/><br/>Nyna finds her friend, Avon, singing on the platform and joins in. Jesse, on the other side, hears Nyna. Jesse runs to the other side, but it's too late. Nyna is gone. However, Avon gives Jesse Nyna's Instagram handle. Jesse shows Darin some of Nyna's posts, but Darin isn't impressed because she doesn't have enough followers. With Vito's assistance, Jesse tracks Nyna to a park. Jesse pulls Nyna aside and guarantees her dreams will become reality. He only wants her to sing. And he will produce the record independently. Can Nyna and Jesse overcome their past and take the music world by storm?<br/><br/>This film deserves a soundtrack. Jesse and Nyna are two sides of the same coin. Both struggle with addiction and loss. It's Lizzy who pulls them together and allows them to trust. The acting shines a light on the industry. While many hunger for soul music, the industry pushes clickbait. Today, fans live in a world of algorithms that force commonality instead of individuality. The director makes cinematic choices to have Nyna stare into the camera during panic, loss, and fear. Viewers can feel her slipping away and asking for help. This film is art.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

He finds a chest belonging to great, great grandfather Alejandro with an idol inside. Alexander questions his family about the artifact at dinner. His grandfather, Gilbert, explains that three witch sisters gave the idol to Alejandro for good luck. However, they instructed Alejandro to return it when he had enough, or his luck would turn. Alejandro became wealthy and refused to return the artifact. A disease took over his crops, and Alejandro burned them. The fire spread and devastated Soledad. Now, Alexander thinks he possesses Alejandro's luck. Frank grabs the idol and throws it in the trash.<br/><br/>The family boards the RV for their trip while leaving Gilbert behind to watch the dog. Val crashes the RV after a series of unfortunate accidents. They stop at a botánica to figure out what to do next. Alexander and Mia wait outside while the others shop.

Mia and Alexander say they want to learn about their heritage and convince their mother to rent an RV for the remainder of the vacation. This road trip will go from no good to terrible. Will the Garcia family survive intact, or will the curse strike again?<br/><br/>Inspired by Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst, the start allows viewers to connect with Alexander's loving family.

		"mtitle": "Tyler Perry's Duplicity",
		"review": "Attorney Marley exercises with her friend, journalist Fela, at a spin gym with Marley's boyfriend, private investigator Tony. Marley catches up to Fela in the parking lot and asks Fela to join them for breakfast with Fela's husband, Rodney. Fela agrees if Marley's friend, Officer Kevin, doesn't come.<br/><br/>Tony and Rodney arrive at breakfast first. Tony and Rodney hide their issues from their partners. Fela and Marley join them.

Someone calls Deloris and warns her that a black man is running in her alley after robbing her neighbor. Deloris calls the police.<br/><br/>Rodney turns around the corner, and two officers, Kevin and Caleb, point their guns at him. Kevin screams gun, and Caleb shoots. As the police rush Rodney to the hospital, Fela sits at the anchor desk and reports breaking news. Her producers pull Fela off the air, and she runs to the hospital. Unfortunately, Rodney dies from his wounds. Marley can't contain her rage and promises to make the city pay for killing Rodney. However, the more Marley digs, she becomes unsure of what happened. Was it another racially motivated police shooting or a murder-by-cop?<br/><br/>This thriller takes a hot-button topic and turns it on its head. Marley's quest starts with a political fight to make the city pay for racial wrongdoings. Then, she stumbles into the seedy truth. Marly stops blindly following the narrative and unpacks the cause. With the preaching aside, this movie gives the audience a few good twists with incredible performances from a note-worthy cast. This film is one of Tyler's better dramatic movies since Acrimony.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
