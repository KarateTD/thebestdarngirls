Jade and G-Ro leave the restaurant to spend quality time at home. The police charge and arrest G-Ro for robbery and murder. He tells Jade to get his money and bail him out. Jade returns home and looks for the cash. Then, she hears someone breaking into the front door and hides. They find the money, steal it, and leave.<br/><br/>Jade visits G-Ro in prison. Without the money, she doesn't have enough for rent or his bail. He demands that Jade move out of the apartment, get rid of the stolen car, and find a way to make money fast to pay his bail.<br/><br/>Jade moves in with her mother, Terri, and little sister, Saraya. Then, she gets a job waiting tables at a high-end restaurant. Jade confides to her manager, Angel, that her life is falling apart. Then, Jade sees a group of well-dressed women at the bar. Angel explains that the women are sugar babies. Later, Jade gets a call from G-Ro. He's disappointed in her low-paying job. He tells her to strip to make fast money. Terri kicks Jade out of the house. Angel can see that Jade is in distress and allows Jade to stay at her home.<br/><br/>Angel's home impresses Jade. Angel admits that her sugar daddy, Drew, pays for it. Jade walks downstairs to find Angel with two friends, Dominique and Nokia.

Angel invites Jade to a sugar daddy party so she can get an up-close view of the lifestyle.<br/><br/>Jade feels like a fish out of water around a room full of wealthy men. A man verbally and physically harasses Jade when Anthony intervenes. Jade admits that she doesn't enjoy feeling like property. HLater, Anthony comes to Jade's job and asks her on a proper date. She agrees. Angel is excited because Anthony is a big fish for a sugar baby. As the relationship progresses, Angel reminds Jade that the relationship is transactional. However, she can't keep her feelings out of the equation. Will things change when G-Ro gets out of jail?<br/><br/>This movie is sexy, thought-provoking, and drama-filled. While the film gives a romanticized view of the sugar lifestyle, it warns the viewers of the pitfalls. Jade's main flaw didn't get settled in the film. She never had a plan and relied solely on others. The clothing and sets are perfect. And the dialog sets the scene. This movie grabs your attention but should be used as an instruction manual. It's a warning.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy",
		"review": "Today marks the 4th anniversary of Mr. Darcy's death. Bridget calls Daniel to look after her children - Billy and Mabel - so she can commiserate with friends. They offer lots of advice, but nothing helps Bridget. She reflects on her time with her dad, Colin, and remembers he told her to live. She opens her diary and starts to write again. She will date and rejoin the workforce.<br/><br/>Bridget drops her children off at school and applauds a teacher standing up to the 'perfect mom.' Bridget discovers the teacher is Mr. Wallaker. He teaches Billy's science class and directs the school choir. She doesn't deny that he's attractive but considers him off-limits.<br/><br/>Bridget takes her kids to the park. As she contemplates life, she hears her kids yelling because they are stuck in a tree. Bridget climbs the tree, but fear pins her to the branches. A park employee, Roxster, comes to assist. After Roxster saves the Darcy family, Bridget and Roxster text constantly. Bridget adores their current relationship until Roxster wants to meet in person. He is much younger than her. As time progresses, Bridget wonders if this relationship is the best for her and her family. Should she hold out for something more, or was Mark her one true love?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding, this movie respects its core audience with callbacks to the previous three films. The film's synopsis is misleading. Bridget isn't choosing between Roxster and Mr. Wallaker. She chooses between doing what's fun versus doing what's admirable. While this script moves you, it's not as funny as its predecessors. And several moments feel like the end, but it's not. These false endings make the picture feel longer and cause it to drag. This movie is purely for the core fans and won't gain new ones.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Kinda Pregnant",
		"review": "Best friends Lainy and Kate dreamed about their futures in grade school. Lainy always knew she wanted to be a wife and mother, but Kate was unsure. Today, Kate is married to Mark, and Lainy is dating Dave. After four years of dating, Lainy thinks he will finally propose. However, Dave doesn't ask for her hand in marriage but for a threesome. Lainy loudly breaks up with Dave and his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>Lainy commiserates at a restaurant with Kate but notices Kate only drinking water. Kate admits she's pregnant. Lainy's envy grows when their co-worker, Shirley, is pregnant. Lainy feels out of place as Kate and Shirley bond over their growing bellies.<br/><br/>Lainy continues her farce and takes Kate shopping for maternity clothes. While Kate looks around, Lainy grabs a pregnancy belly and tries on clothes in the dressing room. Lainy steals the belly. Later, Lainy takes the belly and wears it to a yoga class. She loves the way people see and treat her. Lainy falls in class, and the instructor tries to help. Lainy pushes her away. A classmate, Megan, stands up for Lainy and follows Lainy out of the class. Megan assumes Lainy's pregnant, and Lainy doesn't correct her. They become fast friends.<br/><br/>Later, Lainy goes to a coffee shop without her belly and meets an endearing guy, Josh.. They exchange pleasantries and part. Then, Megan invites Lainy for dinner. It's then Lainy discovers that Megan and Josh are siblings. Josh stands in awe at her pregnant belly. Now Lainy has to lie to keep her friendship with Megan and relationship with Josh while hiding her lies from Kate. She knows it has to end but how?<br/><br/>Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. Lainy tells the truth to one person: school counselor Fallon. While she gives hilarious advice, it's crass but necessary. This script provides OMG laughs at the shocking things the characters say. And it offers an honest conversation about pregnancy, birth, and motherhood. It's the flowery ending that won't sit well with some. This film is funny, but viewers shouldn't repeat it in real life, hoping for the same outcome.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "You're Cordially Invited",
		"review": "Jim anxiously awaits his daughter's return from college. He jumps to the door when Jenni arrives but isn't expecting her boyfriend, Oliver. Jenni excitedly shows Jim her engagement ring. He calms down and offers to help with the wedding. Jenni dreamt of having her nuptials at the same place her parents did, Palmetto Island. Jim calls, and the receptionist, Scarlet, remembers him. She reminds Jim that the island can only handle one wedding at a time. The earliest date Scarlet can find is July 1st. Scarlet starts to write Jim's information, but her empty pen leaves an imprint on the page. She reaches for another pen and has a heart attack.<br/><br/>Margot produces reality TV shows but halts when she sees her little sister, Neve, and Neve's boyfriend, Dixon, in the lobby. Margot can't take her eyes off Neve's engagement ring. Margot reminds Neve of their favorite place, the island where their grandmother lived, Palmetto Island. Margot offers to throw the wedding and calls the venue. The new receptionist, Leslie, answers and looks through the book. He doesn't see the imprint his mother, Scarlet, left. He books Neve's wedding for July 1st.<br/><br/>Margot, Jim, and the pair of newlyweds ride to the venue. After a discussion, they discover they have weddings booked for the same day on the small island. They run to Leslie, and he shows them Margot's reservation in the book. Jim reiterates that he booked his reservation with Scarlet. Jim sees the imprint and uses a pencil to expose it. Leslie realizes they double-booked the island. However, Margot's credit card is on file, so she gets the reservation.<br/><br/>As Margot watches Jim interact with Jenni, she feels sad about taking Jenni's venue. So, Margot and Jim call a truce. They pull Leslie aside and decide to break down the wedding and its events to accommodate both groups. Leslie agrees to this arrangement while Jim and Margot leave with a smile. This truce is short-lived. By nightfall, one couple will split, a dock will collapse, and an alligator will bite someone.<br/><br/>This movie is reminiscent of Bride Wars. Instead of the brides-to-be, it's the father-of-the-bride and maid-of-honor. Margot and Jim have an extremely co-dependent relationship with their loved one. This premise sets up the script for some humorous moments as Jim and Margot plot and scheme to outsmart each other. However, most of the jokes fall flat. It tries to be outlandish but becomes sad. The shameless cameos won't grab your attention either, but the saving grace is the unexpecting romance inside the comedy. The conclusion will make you laugh more than the movie. Viewers should save this movie as background noise on a rainy day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "CIA agents Matt and Emily retrieve the Industrial Control Systems key from terrorists. The key can control any electrical system. Their boss, Chuck, arranges an extraction flight with Emily's ex-boyfriend, Baron, at a nearby airport hanger. Baron attempts to flirt, but Emily loves Matt. They relax on the plane. She tells him that she's pregnant with their first child. Emily starts feeling ill and races to the bathroom. However, the flight attendant says it's broken. Matt and Emily know the flight crew are terrorists, and they demand the key. They jump off before it crashes with the terrorist and key on board. Matt thinks someone in the agency gave them up. They decide to fake their death and live in the shadows.<br/><br/>Emily and Matt have new identities and two children, Alice and Leo, fifteen years later. Alice is a social butterfly and keeps secrets from Emily. Leo is a gamer who stresses about his health.<br/><br/>After her soccer match, Alice asks to study with friends. Emily and Matt agree, but Emily thinks Alice is lying. Emily hacks into Alice's computer and tracks underage Alice at an adult nightclub. Matt and Emily find Alice at the club and force Alice to leave, but a young man stops them. Emily and Matt use their skills to take down the young man and his friends. Emily, Matt, and Alice return home.<br/><br/>Emily and Matt answer the door and see Chuck on their porch. Someone streamed their fight and put it on social media. He warns that their location isn't safe. A terrorist shoots Chuck in the neck. Emily and Matt escape and rush to their kids. Matt admits that he removed the key from the box before he gave the box to the terrorist on the plane. He hid the key in the one place Emily would never look: her mother's home in England. They must grab their kids, fly to England, and retrieve the key before someone kills them or their children.<br/><br/>This movie has a score of action scenes, but the editing isn't smooth. It makes the audience feel disoriented. The script is funny and will connect to parents who've traveled with their family. The first plot twist is foreseeable, but the second points to a sequel. It won't be necessary, but viewers can see the pair team up again.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
