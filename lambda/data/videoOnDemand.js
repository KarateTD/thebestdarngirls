While holding the record for most running yards in a season, Jim Brown feels respected on the field, but not off it. As they sit in the hotel room trying to convince Malcolm to party, the men will scold each other's motives, interrogate their role in the black community, and question their future.  After this one night, each man's life will change forever.<br/><br/>Based on the One Night in Miami play, this provocative tale, inspired by real-life events, will leave you awestruck with brilliant performances.  The conversations between these men are poignant, striking, provoking, and critical for their advancement. But after one night together, these in-depth and controversial conversations inspire change in each man.  Whether it's a song, a name, a job, or a book, the world will grow from it.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Our Friend",
		"review":"Journalist Matt Teague sits at his computer and starts to write about his wife, Nicole, who lost her battle to cancer.  The widower and father of two, Molly and Evie, writes about the time he came to Nicole's first play.  Nicole warns Matt that Dane, a stagehand who asked her out, will be at the cast party.  Matt agrees to go and be kind to Dane because Dane is respectful.  Then, Matt writes about Nicole's diagnosis, and Dane dropping his entire life to help them. Soon, Dane went from Nicole's friend to their friend. As their world comes to a foreseeable end, can Matt and Dane keep it together for the girls and Nicole's memory?<br/><br/>Based on The Friend by Matthew Teague, this movie starts as a story for a woman and becomes a thank you letter to a dear friend.  The movie opens with Matt and Nicole deciding to tell Molly and Evie that Nicole is dying in a few months. From that moment, the story isn't told in a linear fashion, so you must pay attention to the time and dates. It does run long but it gives a strong ending for your time.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Joe works as a middle school music teacher in M.S. 70.  During class, the principal calls Joe to the hallway.  They can offer him a full-time teaching position with time off and benefits, no more part-time work for him.  He goes to his mother's tailor shop, and Libba tells him that he must take the job.  Libba wants Joe to have a steady income with benefits, not an unstable gig, so Joe tells Libba he will take the job.  Joe gets a call from Curley, a former student, and Curley is a drummer for Dorothea Williams, a famous local jazz saxophonist.  Dorothea needs a new pianist. Joe runs downtown as fast as he can and meets with Dorothea.  She tells Joe to sit at the piano and join them.  At first, Joe is confused because he doesn't know the song they are playing, but then he gets into a zone.  When he opens his eyes, the band watches in awe.  Dorothea tells him to get a suit, come back at 9 pm tonight, and congratulations.  Joe made the band.  Excited, he runs home, talking on his phone, and falls into an open sewer. Now, Joe is a soul headed to the Great Beyond.  He runs from the Great Beyond, falls off the bridge, and falls into the Great Before.  All the soul counselors introduce themselves as Jerry.  It's their job to give souls their personality, but one spot remains open.  Once the soul fills that spot by going to the Hall of Everything, they get an Earth pass and start their life.  Jerry assumes Joe is a mentor for souls looking for the spark to fill the last spot.  After several failed attempts to return to earth, Joe sees he is not dead but in a coma at the hospital.  Joe decides to pretend to be a mentor and steal an Earth pass to get back.  Jerry assigns Joe to 22. Twenty-two doesn't see the point of living if dying is the result.  Joe and '22' make a promise, if he helps her find her spark, '22' will give Joe her Earth pass.  He will live, and she will never be born.<br/><br/>As usual, Pixar delivers the concept of life, death, and the beyond in a touching, palatable, and beautiful way.  To parents, there are plenty of jokes for you to enjoy.  But one concept that will pull you in is the land of Lost Souls.  Some of these lost souls aren't dead.   They are so focused on one thing that they stopped living their life. Putting an image to this concept will strike a chord with you.  This movie is a film the entire family can enjoy, and it's a strong entry to close out the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Craft: Legacy",
		"review":"Eunice and her daughter, Lily, drive across town to move in with Eunice's fiancé, Adam, and Adam's three sons, Isaiah, Jacob, and Abe. At her new school, she tries to remain invisible, but she gets her first period in class and bleeds onto the floor.  Timmy points it out, and her classmates ridicule her.  She goes to the bathroom and cries. Then she hears a knock on the stall door.  It's Frankie, Tabby, and Lourdes.  They coax Lily out of the bathroom and to the cafeteria.  They see Lily's necklace has the symbol of the four corners, and they ask Lily to hang out with them in school and after.  The next day, Lily keeps her head down, but Timmy whispers something in her ear.  When he touches her, she puts her hand up, and Timmy flies across the hall and hits the lockers.  Timmy and Lily get detention, and Tabby, Frankie, and Lourdes see it all.  In school detention, Lily hears a voice telling her to grab her things and asks to go to the bathroom if she hears the voice in her mind.  She asks for permission to leave, and outside the room, Tabby, Frankie, and Lourdes all cheer.  Lily is their 4th.  Now, they can call the corners and have actual powers. But first, they have to go to the woods and bless their coven.  As they call the corners, they stop time, and their coven is blessed.  With their newfound powers, the quartet decides to get revenge on Timmy. As the girls grow into their powers, one goes too far, and someone dies.  Now, they have to bind the witch before she can do more harm.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Craft, this film has a lot of subtle references to the first movie without rehashing it.  It's not a retelling of the story but a continuation.  It does help to see the first to understand the twist coming in this film.  They took the things fans loved about The Craft and mixed in some Charmed to create a new story.  However, it still brings home the message of respect, sisterhood, and abuse of power. If you are comfortable with letting your child watch the first movie, the second will be acceptable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"After We Collided",
		"review":"One month after their breakup, Tessa starts an internship at Vance Publishing, and Hardin gets a new tattoo.  On her first day, she has an awkward run-in with Trevor, from the finance department, in the elevator.  Kimberly tries to introduce Tessa to the boss, Vance, but he's on a conference call and pissed off.  Tessa gets settled and gets her first assignment. Tessa accidentally spends the night at work, and Vance wakes her up.  She impresses him with her initiative, and he tells her to get her things and follow him. After a long night of schmoozing and drinking, Tessa drunk dials Hardin and gives him a piece of her mind, then head to her hotel with Trevor.  Hardin pinpoints her location and heads to Tessa's hotel.  When Hardin arrives, he finds Tessa and a pantless Trevor.  Frustrated, Hardin kicks Trevor out and starts arguing with Tessa. In a few moments, they are in bed together.  With Hardin's mom coming to town, a relapse, and a car accident, fate will test Tessa's trust and Hardin's patience.<br/><br/>Based on the novel After We Collided and the sequel to After, this installment feels like a second book, for example New Moon or Fifty Shades Darker.  The author used this book to create a bigger story and introduce a romantic rival.  And it leaves on a cliffhanger like those books. This film isn't a movie for young kids or tweens, but older teens will enjoy it.  But parents, be ready to discuss toxic relationships and codependency.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
