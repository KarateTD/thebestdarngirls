		"mtitle": "Tyler Perry's Duplicity",
		"review": "Attorney Marley exercises with her friend, journalist Fela, at a spin gym with Marley's boyfriend, private investigator Tony. Marley catches up to Fela in the parking lot and asks Fela to join them for breakfast with Fela's husband, Rodney. Fela agrees if Marley's friend, Officer Kevin, doesn't come.<br/><br/>Tony and Rodney arrive at breakfast first. Tony and Rodney hide their issues from their partners. Fela and Marley join them. The couples eat and go to their prospective jobs while Rodney goes for a morning run.<br/><br/>Kevin briefs officers in the morning about crime statistics. He grabs rookie Officer Caleb to shadow him. Then, Kevin reiterates when a cop says gun, you shoot.<br/><br/>Rodney puts his phone in his pocket and his headphones on his head. Someone calls Deloris and warns her that a black man is running in her alley after robbing her neighbor. Deloris calls the police.<br/><br/>Rodney turns around the corner, and two officers, Kevin and Caleb, point their guns at him. Kevin screams gun, and Caleb shoots. As the police rush Rodney to the hospital, Fela sits at the anchor desk and reports breaking news. Her producers pull Fela off the air, and she runs to the hospital. Unfortunately, Rodney dies from his wounds. Marley can't contain her rage and promises to make the city pay for killing Rodney. However, the more Marley digs, she becomes unsure of what happened. Was it another racially motivated police shooting or a murder-by-cop?<br/><br/>This thriller takes a hot-button topic and turns it on its head. Marley's quest starts with a political fight to make the city pay for racial wrongdoings. Then, she stumbles into the seedy truth. Marly stops blindly following the narrative and unpacks the cause. With the preaching aside, this movie gives the audience a few good twists with incredible performances from a note-worthy cast. This film is one of Tyler's better dramatic movies since Acrimony.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Fighting to Be Me: The Dwen Curry Story",

Cynthia arranges for Eddy to leave Detroit and take a bus to Oakland to live with his Uncle Leon and Aunt Marsha.<br/><br/>Eddy arrives in Oakland, and Leon takes him to an alley filled with people struggling with addiction.

Dwen's closeted boyfriend, DJ, calls an 'airline connect.' Dwen pays the fee and gets a ticket, but the airline cancels it. The 'connect' admits that the credit card holder caught on to the scam and canceled it. Dwen asks the 'connect' what she can get for card numbers. The 'connect' offers free airline tickets for life and a cut of the profits. Dwen makes her first step into a world of white-collar crime, high-profile clients, and several business ventures. It leads to a nightmare, self-discovery, and redemption.<br/><br/>This movie is careful not to glorify Dwen's actions. Everything Dwen does has a negative ripple effect on herself and the people she loves. Viewers will see Dwen trade one addiction for another. Your heart will break when Dwen faces her actions for the first time. The judge assigns Dwen to a male prison, where Dwen survives a sexual assault. The plot pulls the audience into Dwen's struggles while allowing you to laugh at her joy. The costume and make-up teams show Dwen's growth into a celebrity fashion and style icon. This story will open your heart to understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. You will love how this Trap Queen overcame and looked fabulous doing it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Sugar Baby",

He demands that Jade move out of the apartment, get rid of the stolen car, and find a way to make money fast to pay his bail.<br/><br/>Jade moves in with her mother, Terri, and little sister, Saraya. Then, she gets a job waiting tables at a high-end restaurant. Jade confides to her manager, Angel, that her life is falling apart. Then, Jade sees a group of well-dressed women at the bar.

A man verbally and physically harasses Jade when Anthony intervenes. Jade admits that she doesn't enjoy feeling like property. HLater, Anthony comes to Jade's job and asks her on a proper date.

However, she can't keep her feelings out of the equation. Will things change when G-Ro gets out of jail?<br/><br/>This movie is sexy, thought-provoking, and drama-filled. While the film gives a romanticized view of the sugar lifestyle, it warns the viewers of the pitfalls. Jade's main flaw didn't get settled in the film. She never had a plan and relied solely on others. The clothing and sets are perfect. And the dialog sets the scene. This movie grabs your attention but should be used as an instruction manual. It's a warning.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy",
		"review": "Today marks the 4th anniversary of Mr. Darcy's death. Bridget calls Daniel to look after her children - Billy and Mabel - so she can commiserate with friends. They offer lots of advice, but nothing helps Bridget. She reflects on her time with her dad, Colin, and remembers he told her to live. She opens her diary and starts to write again. She will date and rejoin the workforce.<br/><br/>Bridget drops her children off at school and applauds a teacher standing up to the 'perfect mom.' Bridget discovers the teacher is Mr. Wallaker. He teaches Billy's science class and directs the school choir. She doesn't deny that he's attractive but considers him off-limits.<br/><br/>Bridget takes her kids to the park. As she contemplates life, she hears her kids yelling because they are stuck in a tree. Bridget climbs the tree, but fear pins her to the branches. A park employee, Roxster, comes to assist. After Roxster saves the Darcy family, Bridget and Roxster text constantly. Bridget adores their current relationship until Roxster wants to meet in person. He is much younger than her. As time progresses, Bridget wonders if this relationship is the best for her and her family. Should she hold out for something more, or was Mark her one true love?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding, this movie respects its core audience with callbacks to the previous three films. The film's synopsis is misleading. Bridget isn't choosing between Roxster and Mr. Wallaker. She chooses between doing what's fun versus doing what's admirable. While this script moves you, it's not as funny as its predecessors. And several moments feel like the end, but it's not. These false endings make the picture feel longer and cause it to drag. This movie is purely for the core fans and won't gain new ones.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Kinda Pregnant",
		"review": "Best friends Lainy and Kate dreamed about their futures in grade school. Lainy always knew she wanted to be a wife and mother, but Kate was unsure. Today, Kate is married to Mark, and Lainy is dating Dave. After four years of dating, Lainy thinks he will finally propose. However, Dave doesn't ask for her hand in marriage but for a threesome. Lainy loudly breaks up with Dave and his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>Lainy commiserates at a restaurant with Kate but notices Kate only drinking water. Kate admits she's pregnant. Lainy's envy grows when their co-worker, Shirley, is pregnant. Lainy feels out of place as Kate and Shirley bond over their growing bellies.<br/><br/>Lainy continues her farce and takes Kate shopping for maternity clothes. While Kate looks around, Lainy grabs a pregnancy belly and tries on clothes in the dressing room. Lainy steals the belly. Later, Lainy takes the belly and wears it to a yoga class. She loves the way people see and treat her. Lainy falls in class, and the instructor tries to help. Lainy pushes her away. A classmate, Megan, stands up for Lainy and follows Lainy out of the class. Megan assumes Lainy's pregnant, and Lainy doesn't correct her. They become fast friends.<br/><br/>Later, Lainy goes to a coffee shop without her belly and meets an endearing guy, Josh.. They exchange pleasantries and part. Then, Megan invites Lainy for dinner. It's then Lainy discovers that Megan and Josh are siblings. Josh stands in awe at her pregnant belly. Now Lainy has to lie to keep her friendship with Megan and relationship with Josh while hiding her lies from Kate. She knows it has to end but how?<br/><br/>Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. Lainy tells the truth to one person: school counselor Fallon. While she gives hilarious advice, it's crass but necessary. This script provides OMG laughs at the shocking things the characters say. And it offers an honest conversation about pregnancy, birth, and motherhood. It's the flowery ending that won't sit well with some. This film is funny, but viewers shouldn't repeat it in real life, hoping for the same outcome.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
