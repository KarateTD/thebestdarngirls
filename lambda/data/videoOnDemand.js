		"review":"David and Creeper are tax collectors for Wizard.  For a cut of profits from illegal activity, they offer protection to the underworld of Los Angeles.  David, with the help of family, makes sure the count is right.  Creeper makes sure people pay if they come up short.  After a long day of collecting, David goes home to his wife, Alexis, and their children.  Alexis tells David the count is off by $20,000.  From jail, Wizard calls Alexis and informs Alexis the count is small.  Next, Wizard warns Alexis something big is coming. David focuses back on the money when he gets a message that Venom has a $200,000 tax payment.  When David and Creeper show up to collect, Venom surprises them by taking the money back and giving it to another man.  It's Conejo.  Conejo tells David and Creeper that Wizard's reign is over.  They can continue to collect taxes, but it has to be for him, so David and Creeper leave. Later at David's daughter's quinceanera, Louis tells David and Creeper to relax.  Louis and his men will take care of Conejo.  As the party winds down, Conejo's right-hand woman approached them at the party.  Conejo wants to meet them now. Since David and Creeper rejected his offer of power under him, he will destroy Creeper, David, and everyone they love.  David's family is first on the list.<br/><br/>While this movie will develop a cult following, it doesn't have the depth of other gangster-family movies.  It tries to be Belly but lacks sincerity.  The Tax Collector attempts to have the violence of John Wick but lacks the style.  It picks and chooses when to translate Spanish to English and doesn't give enough back story for other characters.  While it could have a part two, it should go straight to DVD.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Secret Garden",
		"review":"After both of her parents die, Mary is pulled from an orphanage to live with her eccentric Uncle Archibald.   The house manager, Mrs. Medlock, runs a tight ship, and she will not let Mary disrupt it.  Mrs. Medlock assigns Martha to be Mary's assistant. At night, Mary hears screams and cries but isn't allowed to explore the home.  Mary questions Mrs. Medlock about the noises, but Mrs. Medlock doesn't answer them. On her first day out, a dog discovers Mary and growls at her.  She follows him to a large wall but heads home.  Back at the house, Mary hears the cries and screams again.  With faux bravery, she follows the sound. In a room, she finds a bedridden boy named Colin.  They discover they are cousins.  Colin suffers from an illness that leaves him unable to walk, allergic to everything, and humpback.  Soon, Mrs. Medlock and Martha see them talking, and Mary is in hot water with Archibald.  He warns Mary to stay away from Colin, or Archibald will send her to boarding school.  The next day, she sees the same dog, but stuck in a bear trap.  Mary frees him, but he runs away and goes behind the wall.  Mary climbs over and finds a magnificent garden with animals and plants. Later, Mary discovers hidden letters from her mother and aunt.  They describe the garden as a healing garden.  Mary knows what she has to do.  Mary has to get Colin and take him to the garden to heal him, even if she loses her home for revealing the truth.<br/><br/>Based on The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett, this movie proves why books should not become movies.  The long slow journey through the woods doesn't seem long in a book because the reader discovers it with every word.  However, this moment feels like a boring eternity when played out in a movie.  The actors, director, wardrobe, and make-up did a great job.  A movie watcher will not get the same feeling as a reader does.  After so many movie adaptations, this book should be left alone.<br/><br/>1.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Secret: Dare to Dream",
		"review":"Miranda's family is on the financial brink.  While she is good at her job, home repairs, household bills, and dental issues have her drowning in debt.  She is a widowed mother of three and works for her boyfriend, Tucker.  During an argument with her daughter, Missy, Miranda rear ends Bray. He puts the bumper back in her car and follows them home.  As Bray sits with Miranda and her kids, he talks about the importance of positive thinking. Bray heads home because a storm is coming.  Before Bray drives away, he leaves a manilla envelope in Miranda's mailbox.  The next morning, the condition of Miranda's home stuns Bray.  A tree went through the roof, making the kitchen unlivable.  Bray offers to take another week off of work to fix the roof, and he will charge her only $500.  However, the roof isn't his only concern.  He notices the mailbox, along with the envelope inside, is missing.  That one envelope contains a secret that will change all their lives.<br/><br/>Based on The Secret by Rhonda Byrne, The Secret is a Hallmark Movie and Mysteries movie with A-list actors.  It's an inspiring movie about attitude and how it attracts positive or negative energy to you.  Like any H.M.M. movie, there is a misunderstanding, feeling of foolishness, and then love.  In the beginning, you won't be able to figure out the secret.  When Bray slowly reveals his past, you can figure out what he is hiding.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Fatal Affair",
		"review":"Recent empty-nesters, Ellie and Marcus, left the city and moved to a gorgeous home with a private beach. She attends her last meeting at the firm, but the presence of an old college friend, David, catches her off guard.  David works for a technology firm and plans to use his expertise to gain access to a corporate spy's emails.  Ellie planned on meeting her friend, Courtney, for drinks and decides to invite David to come too.  He happily obliges.  After they get to the club, Courtney calls with disappointing news.  She can't make it, leaving Ellie and David alone. Ellie learns that David divorced his wife and has no children.  Ellie admits, although she loves Marcus, she feels unsatisfied in her marriage.  David invites her to the dancefloor, and they almost kiss.  She retreats to the bathroom and tries to cool off.  David runs after her, and they have a passionate make-out session in the bathroom.  Just before they start having sex, Ellie stops David dead in his tracks. David text the next day for forgiveness, but Ellie ignores his calls and blocks his number.  With her life back to normal, Ellie invites Courtney for dinner, and Courtney brings a plus one: David.  Stunned, Ellie isn't sure what to do, but David pretends like they are meeting for the first time. She tries to warn Courtney about David, but its too late.  David took a preemptive strike and told her Ellie was the aggressor in the bathroom.  With a bit of investigation, Ellie will uncover David's dark past, dirty secret, and long-time obsession.<br/><br/>Fatal Affair is a mix of The Perfect Guy, Enough, The Good Son, and Fatal Attraction.  It provides two cliffhangers and some fun close calls.  So, how does the movie differ from a Lifetime movie? There isn't a nosy best friend, co-worker, or neighbor, just one woman who made a wrong decision.  Also, the cops are not morons. This story of an obsessive stalker isn't new, but it's acted very well.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Outpost",
		"review":"A new but experienced group of soldiers deploy to PRT Kamdesh in 2006.  When they land, they see the dire situation in the terrain.  In a valley, three mountains surround the men.  At any moment, the Taliban can perch on a hill and strike.  Every day they are met with attacks and wonder when the big one will come.  While defending themselves, the men must convince the locals to put down their weapons and fight against the Taliban. With little supplies, no plumbing, and worried family members at home, these men keep their orders and country in their hearts. They deal with spies, customs, and an alarmist interpreter before the Battle of Kamdesh.<br/><br/>Based on The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor by Jake Tapper, The Outpost is a gripping movie.  It uses the first hour to get to know the men and their camaraderie.  The second hour is the battle with no relief. You will be on edge with every move these soldiers make on known and unknown terrain.  If you or a loved one has war-induced PTSD, The Outpost may be a trigger.  Otherwise, this movie is worth the rental money.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
