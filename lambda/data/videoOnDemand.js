		"review": "Tally, known as Squint in the dorms, can't wait for her 18th birthday. She will become the person she always wanted and join the City of Pretties.

It's the night before Peris's surgery, and Tally worries she will lose him once he moves to The City and becomes a Pretty.

Peris says goodbye. Tally is happy for him but sad for herself. Tally's classmate, Shay, notices. One month later, Tally sneaks out of the dorms and goes to the bridge, but Peris doesn't show. She locates him, but he doesn't want to talk to her. Tally makes a daring escape, and Shay saves her. They go to the dorms, become friends, and share the same birthday. Tally can't wait until they will be Pretties together.<br/><br/>Tally doesn't believe her eyes when she sees one of the friends handing Shay a book. Shay says she got it from David.

This plot follows the formula for post-apocalyptic dramas but uses looks as its focus. Making yourself beautiful appeals to a younger audience raised in a world of filters. However, they don't see what they sacrifice over time. This film takes it to the extreme, but the message resonates. Aside from the message, the graphics are mesmerizing. It brings the audience into this new world. Parents can use this movie to open a dialog with their teens.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Rebel Ridge",
		"review": "Terry bikes down the street with headphones on and doesn't hear police behind him. They clip his back tire and force Terry off the bike. Officer Evan and Steve hold Terry at gunpoint and say he tried to evade the police. Terry has to be at the courthouse soon. So, he allows the officers to look through his things. They find a bag with over $30,000 inside. Terry explains that $10,000 is for his cousin's bail, and the rest is to start a business. They ask why Terry's cousin, Michael, needs bail. Terry explains it's for a drug charge. They determine the money is for illegal purposes and seize it.<br/><br/>Terry races to the courthouse to explain, but they won't listen. They will process Michael and send him to jail. A clerk, Summer, hears Terry's pleas and meets with Terry at a diner. Summer informs Terry that he is a victim of civil forfeiture.<br/><br/>Terry rides to the police station and sits with Officer Jessica. He reports the money stolen and names the two officers as the thieves. Chief Sandy tells Terry to leave and threatens him. Terry offers them a deal. He will take $10,000 to bail out Michael, and they can keep the rest. Later, Terry asks to see Michael before they send him to jail in exchange for the cash, and Sandy agrees.<br/><br/>Terry spends the night in the woods and bikes to the police station. However, Sandy tells Terry he is three minutes late. Terry travels to Summer's office, but she's afraid. Exposing the truth will affect her job and her daughter. Terry goes back to the police house to get his money. However, he reveals a startling cover-up. Can he survive to tell the truth?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, Rebel Ridge unpacks civil forfeiture and other police problems that impact all citizens. Officers can seize your property without charging you with a crime. Chief Sandy makes a dire mistake. He assumes Terry is an unhoused individual without help. However, Terry is a marine with deadly acronyms. Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Also, the writers didn't force a romance between Terry and Summer. Terry only had one goal: to save Michael. This film will be a favorite in your Netflix queue.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Zee lights candles in a deconsecrated church when her handler, Finn, presents her with a job. She. has to go to a nightclub and kill everyone in the back room.

They searched her phone and found text messages to Coco. Sey goes to the hospital to interview Jenn.<br/><br/>Finn enters the church and sees Zee lighting candles for her victims. However, she didn't complete the mission. He wants her to finish the job and kill Jenn. Zee creates a fake French consulate ID and enters Jenn's hospital room.

She wants to save Jenn before another killer finds her. Can Zee and Sey save Jenn and find the drugs without killing each other?<br/><br/>This remake has some interesting fighting scenes but teeters on becoming a superhero movie during some action sequences. The dialog is funny, but the backing track drowns out the actors periodically. The plot attempts to be mysterious but gives itself away in the first 30 minutes. This film isn't great, but it's a decent 2-hour distraction from boredom with zero nudity and some blood.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "The Union",
		"review": "Tom directs his team to extract a CIA turncoat, Derek. Roxy watches from above while Nick works on the ground with other operatives. Nick and Derek make it to the bridge and wait for further instructions. A van pulls up, shoots them, and steals their briefcase. Roxy is the only survivor.<br/><br/>Mike hangs at a bar with his friends when a familiar face, Roxy, walks through the door. Roxy asks if Mike wants to take the party to a better location, and he says yes. Roxy hugs Mike and admits she has an ulterior motive for bringing him to a remote location on a hill. She stabs Mike in the neck with a tranquilizer, knocks him out, and pushes him down.<br/><br/>Shocked, Mike wakes up in The Savoy Hotel in London. Mike exits the lobby and hears Tom call him over. Tom and Roxy explain they are part of a covert task force called The Union. They are a group of blue-collar workers who hide in the shadows and do the dirty work. They value street smarts over book smarts.<br/><br/>After breakfast, Tom updates Mike on their situation. Derek sold a list of every law enforcement officer, intelligence operative, Union member, and their families worldwide to a woman called the auctioneer. This woman, Juliet, will sell the list on the black market in 2 weeks. They want to buy access to the auction. They need a nobody to buy the device for access. Roxy thinks Mike is perfect for the job. Mike doesn't like being called a nobody but agrees to help. They will turn six months of training into two weeks. Then, Mike will meet Juliet to exchange a device for $5 million. They will use it to access the auction and buy the list to delete it. This job should be easy. Right?<br/><br/>Espionage movie fans know to look for the double-cross or the story within the story. Some viewers will get the person right, but others won't. Also, you feel that Roxy and Mike have an unresolved history. They act flirty and fun when they first meet, but things come to the surface when their lives are on the line. This film has fistfights, shootouts, and car chases. But it shocks when Roxy reveals her biggest secret to Mike and the audience. The film is entertaining and hints at a sequel. But it won't garner your undivided attention.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Katie returns to LA to pursue acting after caring for her ailing mother. She checks into a shady AirBnB, hosted by DJ and Shadi. Katie will meet with a talent agent in the morning. She wakes up to a strange liquid dripping on her face. Shadi explains it's a sewage problem. Katie sees the same sewage dripping on her clothes. Shadi offers to rent her clothes to Katie for $40. It's her only option, so Katie agrees.<br/><br/>Katie arrived at the audition and reached for her monologue. She grabs Shadi's lottery ticket and presses her thumb against the registration button. The ticket snaps a photo and enters Katie in the lottery. After the manager makes creepy suggestions, Katie leaves. The ticket pings in her pocket and declares Katie the winner. Then, every actress waiting in line gets a ping from their tickets and attacks Katie. Noel bursts through the ceiling while Katie battles a karate and yoga class. Noel congratulates Katie for winning and offers her five free saves before he charges 10%.<br/><br/>Years ago, California created a grand lottery. If the winner is alive at sundown, then they keep the money. However, someone can kill the winner and keep the prize. The lottery is at an all-time high of $3.6 billion.<br/><br/>Noel hands Katie a contract to sign, and Katie does. She asks him if she can quit the lottery. Noel says the only way out is to leave the city limits. But she will forfeit the prize. Noel agrees to help her flee, even though he will get nothing. Katie isn't sure she can trust him, but he's her only choice. Can Katie survive winning the lottery?<br/><br/>What if the Purge and Hunger Games were a comedy? This film is your answer. The fight scenes are never grave, along with most of the dialogue. This storyline escapes the horror genre by having two confirmed kills. Then you have close calls and injuries. This picture is perfect for streaming and an acceptable date movie without romance.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
