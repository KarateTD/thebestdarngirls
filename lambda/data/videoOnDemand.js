		"review": "Alonzo prevents his son, Trent, from getting into a fight with local gangbangers. He pulls Trent away and admonishes him for not following directions. Trent points out that Alonzo is usually away serving his country. He had no idea his father would be back today. Alonzo is home now and ready to relax.<br/><br/>Officers Erin and Michelle walk the beat to keep the streets safe for shop owners like Ms. Crystal, Mr. Troy, and Mr. Trin. The local kingpin, Raw Dog, is enemy number one for Erin. Pastor Zeke heads a men's prayer group when the room shakes. Alonzo, Trent, and Daphne feel the tremors at home, too. Then, the news reports of an invasion. Alonzo admits that the government heard chatter about a sleeper cell called Orochi. Orochi plans to take over America one city at a time. They chose Compton because they think the citizens don't care about the community or the people. They are going to learn the hard way that Compton is ready to fight.<br/><br/>Of all the places to invade, they pick Compton. Any viewer knows this will end badly. While the invasion is the main point of the story, the subplot tackles community issues and parenting. The actors did the script justice by conveying pure, unadulterated emotions with each heartfelt and panicked line. The casting department signed on the heavy-hitters from every genre. Now, the plot loses it with the graphics and robots. The drones and firepower were believable, but the other technology turns this film into science fiction. Some of the post graphics are over-the-top. This movie is an enjoyable apocalyptic thriller.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "The Woman in Cabin 10",
		"review": "Journalist Laura returns to work after someone murdered her latest informant. Laura's boss pleads with Laura to take time off, but she won't. She wants to do a human interest story to lift people's spirits. And she has a subject in mind. Philanthropist and heiress Annie and her husband, Richard, sold rides on their new luxury yacht to their close friends. The final stop will take them to the charity gala. They will donate the money to cancer charities.<br/><br/>Laura boards the boat and meets the staff and other passengers, but one catches her eye. It's her ex-boyfriend, photographer Ben. Richard joins the passengers and tells them that Annie won't be joining them today. She isn't feeling well, but will join them tomorrow. Laura settles into cabin eight and unpacks.<br/><br/>Later, Laura dresses for dinner and walks toward the dining quarters. She hears Ben talking to Heidi and opens cabin 10 to hide. A woman exits the bathroom while drying her hair. Laura apologizes for the intrusion and leaves. During dinner, a staff member whispers to Laura that Annie wants to meet in private.<br/><br/>Laura meets with Annie to discuss Annie's speech at the gala. She wants Laura to improve it. Laura wants an evening to make minor adjustments. She returns to her cabin and retires for the evening. Later, yelling and banging woke her. Laura hears a splash, runs to her balcony, spots a woman sinking into the water, and sees a bloody handprint on the wall. Laura calls her concierge for help.<br/><br/>Laura alerts security about the woman in cabin 10. However, the guests that was supposed to stay in that room cancelled. Now, security and staff do a headcount, and everyone is present. Richard thinks Laura's trauma from losing her source is resurfacing. He assures Laura that the woman doesn't exist. She finds hair and hides it. It's proof that the woman exists and fell overboard. She will stop at nothing to prove it and find the woman's killer.<br/><br/>Based on The Woman in Cabin 10 by Ruth Ware, this film tries to lift the veil off the uber-rich. The set designers made the most of the yacht's environment. This film expresses the dynamic of looking good versus doing it. Annie acknowledges the hypocrisy and works to change it after her passing. The script and film are exciting, but it doesn't end like most mystery novels. You expect the lead to bring everyone into a room and reveal the killer and motive. This adaptation exposes the killer as Laura's life is in danger. Then you have 30 minutes left in the film. That's the moment the script loses its luster. Netflix is the perfect platform for this film, but it's not worth the subscription.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Mechanic Charlie took over her father's shop, O'Malley's, after he died. She spends her nights and weekends restoring an old car, Marge, that they wanted to fix together. On Reddit, she chats with a user named Bullnose about her car issues. However, they have ground rules - no real names and no photos. Charlie's employees, mechanic Kim and receptionist Izzy, believe Charlie should go out, have fun, and date, but Charlie worries about keeping the shop running smoothly. To help raise funds, Izzy manicures clients in the lobby.<br/><br/>Beau's boss, Mr. Miller, calls Beau The Closer. Mr. Miller owns an autobody franchise called Miller's Boys. They are opening three new locations, but the scouting agent made a mistake with their Oakton branch. They didn't account for the mom-and-pop shop, O'Malley's, across the street. Beau enjoys his paycheck but describes his job as soulless. His passion is working on cars, especially Diane. He chats late at night with a user named Grease Monkey on Reddit.<br/><br/>Beau travels to Oakton to set up shop and stays with his friend, Jordan. Jordan complains about his nails and desires to get them done at a new pop-up nail salon. Beau accompanies Jordan, but Beau migrates to the back with the vehicles on lifts. However, he retreats when she mentions the threat to her business next door. Charlie chats about her woes with her friend on Reddit. He encourages her to stand her ground. Will her feelings change when she discovers that Bullnose is Beau, and Beau works for the enemy?<br/><br/>This romantic comedy follows the expected storyline with a modern twist. The writer also made both characters strong and vulnerable. Charlie runs her garage with pride, but her father's loss still hurts. Beau is a killer in the boardroom but desires love and a deeper connection. The main characters have believable chemistry, and the secondary actors add fun and sound advice to the script. This movie is a mindless but enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not worth the Prime subscription. But it's a delightful 2 hours if this is your genre.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Parker's heist gets interrupted when an onlooker cuts them off during their escape. The onlooker shoots two members of Parker's crew, killing one, and flees with their money. The crew gives chase and kills the onlooker at a horse race track.<br/><br/>The crew splits the money and celebrates with laughs. Then, Zen pulls out a gun and shoots everyone except Parker. He escapes through a window. Zen shoots him, and he falls down a hill and into a river. She takes the money and splits.<br/><br/>Parker washes up onshore and hides in a hotel, nursing a bullet wound. Parker drives to Grace's home. She is the widow of one of his crew members, Phil. Parker plans on getting the money so Grace can have Phil's portion. Then, she demands Parker find Zen and kill her.<br/><br/>Parker tracks down Zen in New York. Zen doesn't have the cash. She used it to fund a larger heist. Her president unearthed a sunken ship, The Lady of Arintero, with riches beyond imagination. The treasure is worth millions. And she offers to split it with Parker. Parker takes the job, but there are two problems. First, Zen eliminated his crew. Second, he promised a mobster, Lozini, that he would stay out of New York. Lozini will kill Parker when he learns Parker is in town. Can Parker get the money and maintain his promise to Grace without alerting Lozini?<br/><br/>This heist film attempts to blend the Ocean's Eleven style with the outlandishness of the Fast and the Furious. If you can watch and overcome the farfetch stunts and antics, this picture is enjoyable. The writers prove there is no honor among thieves, but plenty of humor. The plot hints at a love story that provides a much-needed twist at the end. While the humor doesn't disappoint, the overall story has so many moving parts that it can be too complex to follow. This picture would not have done well on the big screen, but found the optimum place on Prime Video.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Ruth and Boaz",
		"review": "Ruth and Breana are a singing duo called 4 O 4, and their manager, Syrus, believes they will take the music world by storm. This performance is significant because Jermaine Dupri is in attendance. However, it holds a special place in Ruth's heart. Her boyfriend, Marlon, brought his parents, Eli and Naomi. They impress Jermaine and Eli, but Naomi doesn't think much of them. Breana tries to convince Ruth to stay in the group, but Ruth says no. Ruth meets Syrus in the parking lot and tells him she's out. Syrus refuses to let her go because he invested $250,000 and a car in her career. She offers to give him $3000, the car, and make payments until she pays him back. He says no and threatens her.<br/><br/>Ruth scrolls through her phone and calls Marlon. Naomi answers with devastating news. Marlon and Eli were the victims of a carjacking. Ruth runs to be by Naomi's side. The doctor tells them that neither man made it. Ruth attends the double funeral and overhears Naomi's accountant deliver another blow. Eli leveraged everything to keep their law practice afloat, and the house is in foreclosure. Eli left Naomi's home in Tennessee in her name so the bank can't touch it. Ruth sees Syrus amongst the grieving and pulls him aside. He informs her that he is responsible for the carjacking. Ruth returns home and begs God for guidance. She leaves 1 month's rent for Breana with a note, discovers where Naomi is, and joins her on the bus. Naomi demands that Ruth get off, but Ruth won't budge.<br/><br/>Ruth and Naomi return to the dilapidated home. Ruth makes some insignificant fixes while Naomi removes the cross from the wall. Ruth goes around town to find a job, and she sees day laborers. Lena explains that they harvest grapes. Ruth joins them and travels to Azra Vineyard. Ruth works through both breaks and lunch. The owner, Bo Azra, also known as Boaz, notices her. He introduces himself, but Ruth keeps her distance from the handsome man.<br/><br/>Later, Lena takes Ruth to a bar and signs Ruth up for karaoke. She doesn't see Boaz sitting in the VIP section. Ruth sings, and it speaks to Boaz's soul. He desires to make this beautiful, mysterious, and soulful woman his. He vows to be her protector, and she will need it. Syrus saw a viral video of her performance, and he's coming after her, Naomi, and anyone standing in his way.<br/><br/>Inspired by the book of Ruth, this retelling offers a beautiful story about faith, fear, and love. The script gives viewers enough time to understand and sympathize with Ruth and Naomi. This film offers an entertaining story and doesn't alienate non-Christian audiences. However, the plot skirts Hallmark territory with an upcoming festival and competition. This storyline isn't necessary to the plot and slows down the pace. Sans the Hallmark storyline, this movie tells a heart-clinching story for the family with no sexual innuendos or interactions. It gives a biblical retelling for everyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
