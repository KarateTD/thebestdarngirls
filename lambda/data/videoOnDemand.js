		"review":"Years earlier, the Cooper family spent time hiking in the woods and being carefree.  Now, Ray comforts his daughter, Rachel, as the doctor tells them Amanda's cancer is back.  While there is a drug that can help, it's too expensive.  But Dr. Wu has a stunning development.  Another company created a generic version of the drug, and it's in the final stages of FDA approval. But as more time slips by, Ray finds Dr. Wu and asks if the generic is finally available.  Unfortunately, the maker of the original drug, Bioprime Pharmaceuticals, forced the other company to stop.<br/><br/>As Amanda dies, Ray sees Bioprime's CEO, Simon Keeley, on a news program with Congresswoman Diana Morgan.  They are debating Bioprime's business practices and the cost of their life-saving medication.  Ray calls in to the show and threatens Simon. Six months later, Amanda died, and Ray and Rachel have a mountain of hospital bills.  Ray decides what to cook when he gets a call on the phone.  A man named Martin from Vice has information about Bioprime's bribes and other crimes. Ray leaves but doesn't see Rachel following him. Martin needs Ray's story to blow Bioprime's illicit activities into the spotlight.  Before Ray can gather his thoughts, a man stabs Martin and attacks Ray. Two years later, with Martin dead, Ray never stopped looking into Bioprime and its illegal connections.  Now, he is ready to take action and fulfill his promise.  Ray is going to kill Simon.<br/><br/>What a twist!!! And you have no idea that it's coming.  This movie hides the twist like a magician's sleight of hand. Jason Momoa shows his sensitive side without being the butt of the joke. There should be more fathers like this in movies, streaming, and TV.  Yes, this movie has violence, but parents with tweens shouldn't worry.  This film is a wild ride worth watching.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Tomorrow War",
		"review":"Veteran Dan Forester works as a high school biology teacher, but he wants to work in a research lab.  He adores his wife, Emmy, and daughter, Muri, but he doesn't talk to his estranged father, James.  After another rejection from a research company, Dan tries to enjoy a world cup match with his family and friends at a holiday party.  During the game, a large electrical storm forms, and soldiers appear on the soccer field.  The leader tells the soccer attendees and the millions watching at home that they are from 30 years in the future.  They are at war with a non-human enemy, and in 11-months, humankind will perish.  They need help from people today to fight in the future.  Within 12 months, the world leaders create a global draft, and if you try to escape, a member of your family will take your place. During class, Dan gets an alert that the government is drafting him. Dan knows James used his engineering skills to help people take off the band without alerting the government.  At first, Dan goes to James, but after an argument, Dan decides to go to war. They explain that they call the enemy White Spikes, and if the soldiers are still alive in seven days, they will bring them back.  Dan's fight in the future will bring in face to face with the person he never wanted to be: his father.  He will fight The Tomorrow War and heal his family today.<br/><br/>This movie has elements of Independence Day and Back to the Future, but it is an original concept.  And within the plot, they set themselves apart from these movies. They can only jump seven years from now because time moves forward.  This random explanation elevates the plot beyond other sci-fi movies.  And the detailed graphics will make you wish you had a larger screen. It does contain violence, so it's up to the parent to determine if their child should watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney and Pixar's Luca",
		"review":"Luca is a sea monster that works as a fish herder on his parents' farm.  He hears things about land monsters but never traveled to the surface.  While herding fish, Luca finds a clock and other human items.  Then he hears a voice in the distance claiming the stuff.  The voice belongs to Alberto, another teenage sea monster.  Alberto grabs his stuff, swims to the surface, and changes to human form. Luca goes home to ask his parents, Daniela and Lorenzo, about the surface.  Daniela stops Luca and tells him it's too dangerous.  The next day, Luca finds Alberto and follows him to the surface. Alberto introduces himself, and they go to Alberto's hideout. Luca looks around the room and sees a picture of a Vespa.  This piece of machinery transfixes Luca. Four hours later, Luca and Alberto complete their makeshift Vespa and take it for a joy ride.  After crashing, Luca notices the time and runs home. His parents know he has been to the surface and decides to punish him. Luca runs away to the surface.  On land, Luca finds Alberto, and they head into town.  Then, they spot a Vespa owned by Ercole, the local bully.  He tells them he bought the Vespa after winning the Portorosso Triathlon Cup Race five times in a row.  Then, Ercole tries to push Luca's face into a fountain, but Giulia stops Ercole. She grabs Luca and Alberto and takes them to safety.  Luca and Alberto want to enter the contest and win the prize money to buy a Vespa. So, they ask Giulia to join their team.  But she says no.  When they remind her that she got sick doing it alone, she joins them. But Luca doesn't know his parents came to the surface looking for him and vow to bring him home.<br/><br/>Pixar's animation of a small Italian village looks so real that it will take your breath away at first glance. While the animation is second to none, the storyline doesn't completely engross you into the movie like Pixar's other films. But your children will love the characters and animated transformation from a sea monster to a land monster and back again.  Putting the film on Disney+ was the best choice for viewers.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Anna tells her therapist, Dr. Carl, that she watches her neighbors because has agoraphobia.

Finn, this movie can lead you down the rabbit hole if you don't know the clues to look and listen for while viewing.  This movie does a compelling job of keeping you guessing about each of the characters. While it does get your attention, there are moments the film will lose you.  Whether it's pointless dialogue or lackluster characters, your mind will wander.  Unlike Knives Out, this movie will not make you want to rewatch it for unseen clues.  One watch is enough to entertain and move on.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
