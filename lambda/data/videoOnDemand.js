		"review":"Chris creates his lawn ornaments by hand for the Candy Cane Lane competition. However, his neighbor, 4-time winner Bruce, relies on inflatables. Chris refuses to change and chooses quality over quantity. Chris and his wife, Carol, prepare their children for school. He grabs his daughter's backpack and finds a Notre Dame brochure. Joy admits she doesn't want to attend her family's alma mater, USC. Carol asks their son, Nick, about his math grades. Nick doesn't care about math because he wants to pursue a music career. And Chris worries his youngest daughter, Holly, doesn't believe anymore.<br/><br/>Chris's boss, Lee, calls Chris into his office. Lee sold the company. Now, Lee will let go of half the sales department. Chris is on the wrong side and has to pack up his office.<br/><br/>Chris and Carol walk to Bruce's house for a party, but Chris stops them before they reach the door. He tells Carol he got fired, and she lifts his spirits. During the party, they watch news about the Candy Cane Lane competition on Bruce's TV. The reporters announce that the competition has sponsors, and this year's winner will get $100,000.<br/><br/>Chris wants to buy decorations to get a leg up on the competition. Chris and Holly ride through several detours. They find a shop, Kringles, under a bridge. Shop owner Pepper jumps out of the shadows and shows them around the shop but warns Holly not to play with the dolls in the dollhouse. Chris purchases several items, including a 12 Days of Christmas tree, and Pepper prints the receipt. She tells him to ignore the fine print and sign. Chris signs his name and heads home with his items.<br/><br/>He follows the unusual instructions and assembles the tree. After a rough start, Chris undoubtedly wins the competition. Chris wakes up to see the characters from the song are missing from the tree. Chris runs to Kringles to get spare parts for the tree. He walks to the dollhouse and discovers the dolls are alive. They know Chris signed the receipt like they did. They tell Chris to remember the song Pepper sang because she gave Chris a task. Chris remembers Pepper told him to find the golden rings. And he has until Christmas to uncover them all. But they warn him that Pepper likes to change the rules so she can always win.<br/><br/>This movie switches from real-world issues to a fantasy film within 30 minutes. Then, the script gets wild with an evil elf, Santa, talking ornaments, and a strange milkmaid. However, the conclusion brings the plot back to earth. Chris finds the meaning behind the holiday and understands his children need to follow their chosen paths. This realization saves the story.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"A Royal Christmas Surprise",
		"review":"Riley and Mandla are successful in their personal and professional lives. Their relationship is more loving than ever because Mandla's parents, King Chidike and Queen Nobantu, accepted Riley as a future wife, princess, and queen. Riley and Mandla decided to throw an engagement party to announce their upcoming nuptials to their friends. Also, they will use the party to introduce Mandla's parents to Riley's relatives, Uncle Ray and Aunt Gina.<br/><br/>Chidike and Nobantu fly to Georgia and travel to Ray and Gina's home. Ray and Chidike greet each other like old friends, but Nobantu and Gina size up each other. Gina remembers how Nobantu made Riley feel in Africa, so she plans to pay Nobantu back. Nobantu won't take Gina's disrespect. She will fight fire with fire while keeping her head held high. They will go for the jugular, and Riley must play peacemaker. Can she keep it up when Mandla drops a bomb on her?<br/><br/>This sequel is a wildly different movie than the first, and that's a good thing. It's funnier, wilder, and has more heart. Don't be surprised if you must pause the TV because you are laughing too hard to hear the dialog. Nobantu and Gina don't pull punches, and their is plenty of collateral damage. Amid this craziness, Mandla keeps a life-altering secret from Riley. You laugh while waiting with bated breath for the other shoe to drop. Viewers will look forward to film three if this series keeps its trajectory.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
