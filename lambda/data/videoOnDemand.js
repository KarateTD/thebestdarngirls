"review": "Mechanic Charlie took over her father's shop, O'Malley's, after he died. She spends her nights and weekends restoring an old car, Marge, that they wanted to fix together. On Reddit, she chats with a user named Bullnose about her car issues. However, they have ground rules - no real names and no photos. Charlie's employees, mechanic Kim and receptionist Izzy, believe Charlie should go out, have fun, and date, but Charlie worries about keeping the shop running smoothly. To help raise funds, Izzy manicures clients in the lobby.<br/><br/>Beau's boss, Mr. Miller, calls Beau The Closer. Mr. Miller owns an autobody franchise called Miller's Boys. They are opening three new locations, but the scouting agent made a mistake with their Oakton branch. They didn't account for the mom-and-pop shop, O'Malley's, across the street. Beau enjoys his paycheck but describes his job as soulless. His passion is working on cars, especially Diane. He chats late at night with a user named Grease Monkey on Reddit.<br/><br/>Beau travels to Oakton to set up shop and stays with his friend, Jordan. Jordan complains about his nails and desires to get them done at a new pop-up nail salon. Beau accompanies Jordan, but Beau migrates to the back with the vehicles on lifts. However, he retreats when she mentions the threat to her business next door. Charlie chats about her woes with her friend on Reddit. He encourages her to stand her ground. Will her feelings change when she discovers that Bullnose is Beau, and Beau works for the enemy?<br/><br/>This romantic comedy follows the expected storyline with a modern twist. The writer also made both characters strong and vulnerable. Charlie runs her garage with pride, but her father's loss still hurts. Beau is a killer in the boardroom but desires love and a deeper connection. The main characters have believable chemistry, and the secondary actors add fun and sound advice to the script. This movie is a mindless but enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not worth the Prime subscription. But it's a delightful 2 hours if this is your genre.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Parker's heist gets interrupted when an onlooker cuts them off during their escape. The onlooker shoots two members of Parker's crew, killing one, and flees with their money. The crew gives chase and kills the onlooker at a horse race track.<br/><br/>The crew splits the money and celebrates with laughs. Then, Zen pulls out a gun and shoots everyone except Parker. He escapes through a window. Zen shoots him, and he falls down a hill and into a river. She takes the money and splits.<br/><br/>Parker washes up onshore and hides in a hotel, nursing a bullet wound. Parker drives to Grace's home. She is the widow of one of his crew members, Phil. Parker plans on getting the money so Grace can have Phil's portion. Then, she demands Parker find Zen and kill her.<br/><br/>Parker tracks down Zen in New York. Zen doesn't have the cash. She used it to fund a larger heist. Her president unearthed a sunken ship, The Lady of Arintero, with riches beyond imagination. The treasure is worth millions. And she offers to split it with Parker. Parker takes the job, but there are two problems. First, Zen eliminated his crew. Second, he promised a mobster, Lozini, that he would stay out of New York. Lozini will kill Parker when he learns Parker is in town. Can Parker get the money and maintain his promise to Grace without alerting Lozini?<br/><br/>This heist film attempts to blend the Ocean's Eleven style with the outlandishness of the Fast and the Furious. If you can watch and overcome the farfetch stunts and antics, this picture is enjoyable. The writers prove there is no honor among thieves, but plenty of humor. The plot hints at a love story that provides a much-needed twist at the end. While the humor doesn't disappoint, the overall story has so many moving parts that it can be too complex to follow. This picture would not have done well on the big screen, but found the optimum place on Prime Video.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Ruth and Boaz",
		"review": "Ruth and Breana are a singing duo called 4 O 4, and their manager, Syrus, believes they will take the music world by storm. This performance is significant because Jermaine Dupri is in attendance. However, it holds a special place in Ruth's heart. Her boyfriend, Marlon, brought his parents, Eli and Naomi. They impress Jermaine and Eli, but Naomi doesn't think much of them. Breana tries to convince Ruth to stay in the group, but Ruth says no. Ruth meets Syrus in the parking lot and tells him she's out. Syrus refuses to let her go because he invested $250,000 and a car in her career. She offers to give him $3000, the car, and make payments until she pays him back. He says no and threatens her.<br/><br/>Ruth scrolls through her phone and calls Marlon. Naomi answers with devastating news. Marlon and Eli were the victims of a carjacking. Ruth runs to be by Naomi's side. The doctor tells them that neither man made it. Ruth attends the double funeral and overhears Naomi's accountant deliver another blow. Eli leveraged everything to keep their law practice afloat, and the house is in foreclosure. Eli left Naomi's home in Tennessee in her name so the bank can't touch it. Ruth sees Syrus amongst the grieving and pulls him aside. He informs her that he is responsible for the carjacking. Ruth returns home and begs God for guidance. She leaves 1 month's rent for Breana with a note, discovers where Naomi is, and joins her on the bus. Naomi demands that Ruth get off, but Ruth won't budge.<br/><br/>Ruth and Naomi return to the dilapidated home. Ruth makes some insignificant fixes while Naomi removes the cross from the wall. Ruth goes around town to find a job, and she sees day laborers. Lena explains that they harvest grapes. Ruth joins them and travels to Azra Vineyard. Ruth works through both breaks and lunch. The owner, Bo Azra, also known as Boaz, notices her. He introduces himself, but Ruth keeps her distance from the handsome man.<br/><br/>Later, Lena takes Ruth to a bar and signs Ruth up for karaoke. She doesn't see Boaz sitting in the VIP section. Ruth sings, and it speaks to Boaz's soul. He desires to make this beautiful, mysterious, and soulful woman his. He vows to be her protector, and she will need it. Syrus saw a viral video of her performance, and he's coming after her, Naomi, and anyone standing in his way.<br/><br/>Inspired by the book of Ruth, this retelling offers a beautiful story about faith, fear, and love. The script gives viewers enough time to understand and sympathize with Ruth and Naomi. This film offers an entertaining story and doesn't alienate non-Christian audiences. However, the plot skirts Hallmark territory with an upcoming festival and competition. This storyline isn't necessary to the plot and slows down the pace. Sans the Hallmark storyline, this movie tells a heart-clinching story for the family with no sexual innuendos or interactions. It gives a biblical retelling for everyone.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Fatal Detour",
		"review": "Laren and Donna drive to attend a concert. Donna asks Laren to use the self-driving technology in their electric vehicle, but Laren refuses. Laren claims that trusting technology is not something women like them do. Then, they hear a radio report about a missing famous influencer, Juli. Laren and Donna follow her on social media. They hope Juli is okay. Laren follows the GPS through the backroads and arrives at a mansion. Their car and phones stop working. They enter the empty home, find creepy art on the wall, and hear strange sounds. Soon, the room fills with gas, and they hide inside a pantry. They pray for a way out, but they are in the den of a madman, Tenzo. He is the person holding Juli hostage and live-streaming it on the dark web. He never planned for Laren and Donna to join them. But he's all too happy to make do. Will Donna and Laren make it out alive with Juli?<br/><br/>First, a warning. This movie contains flashing lights. Don't watch if you are sensitive to that effect. Second, the story feels disjointed until the end. The first couple wakes up at the edge of a pool with no knowledge of where they are. Then the plot jumps between Juli's car and Laren's car. You assume they are on the same timeline. Next, Tenzo's monologue covers a gutwrenching topic, but the silly setup distracts you from the message. And the conclusion is as strange as the film. Watch this movie if you dare.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "The Wrong Paris",
		"review": "Dawn questions her family about the mail after finding the mailbox empty. Her sisters, Max and Emily, didn't check it. Then, Dawn sees her grandmother's grin. Birdie hands Dawn a letter from a Parisian art school. Dawn got an acceptance letter from her dream school, but she didn't receive financial aid. Birdie rejoices because Dawn has a Paris fund. Dawn feigns a grin and leaves to sit in her truck alone. Max finds Dawn and asks what's wrong. Dawn used her Paris fund to cover Birdie's medical bills after she fell last year.<br/><br/>Max enters Dawn's workplace with an idea. Max's favorite show, The Honeypot, will host its 16th season in Paris. The show's premise is that an eligible bachelor meets 20 single women. At the conclusion, he will propose. However, the remaining woman has to choose the honey or the money. Dawn could fly to Paris for the show, lose the first round, and stay. She can use the appearance fee for school. Dawn agrees to her sister's plan.<br/><br/>Max and Dawn play pool while Trey watches Dawn at the bar. She walks over to get some more beverages and flirts with Trey. She assumes he's a city slicker, cosplaying as a cowboy. She dances with Trey regardless.<br/><br/>Max coaches Dawn to impress the show's producers, Rachel and Carl. Rachel likes Dawn's small-town vibe. Carl sends Dawn a contract, and she joins the other contestants. They board the plane for Paris and relax. Dawn notices that someone has blacked out the windows. A contestant explains that the producers want to catch their pure reaction when they exit the aircraft.<br/><br/>They exit the plane and learn they are in Paris, TX. Dawn wants to leave now. Rachel reminds Dawn of her contract. As the women fight over swag, Dawn walks to the stables to admire the horse. She finds Trey there and discovers he is the Honeypot. She pleads with Trey to eliminate her first. However, Trey picks her last. He's smitten with her and thinks time will change her mind. Will Dawn choose Paris or The Honeypot?<br/><br/>This film returns comedy to the rom-com genre. It intelligently uses the absurdity of reality television as its backdrop, including the season-opening twists. Unlike most small-town leads, Dawn isn't running away from her life. Trey is a Renaissance man. Cynics will groan and assume they know the ending, but don't give up on this film. The ending is unique, funny, and charming. It offers the romance you want in the 21st century. This picture found a proper home with Netflix.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Photographer Sasha wakes next to her husband, biochemist Ramone, during their drive to their new company-provided home. Ramone's new company, Black Lotus, offered them a fully furnished house in the town of Heartfelt. Then, Nina, Ramone's handler, enters the home. She's there to handle any needs outside of the community, like food, contracts, or scheduling conflicts. They have dinner and prepare for bed. Ramone stirs at 3 a.m. because Black Lotus wants him at work for orientation. When Ramone returns in the evening, he's cold and distant.<br/><br/>Over the next few days, Ramone comes home later and later. Then, he doesn't return at all. Sasha calls Nina for assistance, but Nina ignores her cries for help. Days later, Detectives arrive at Sasha's door. They received a letter from Black Lotus, stating that Ramone never came to work.<br/><br/>Sasha hears a knock at the door. It's the Detectives. They found Ramone covered in someone else's blood. Sasha deeply embraces her husband and bathes him in the shower. They make passionate love, and she's in bliss. But that's short-lived. Sasha will discover that there is something wrong with Ramone, her neighbors, and the town. Can she escape now that she's pregnant?<br/><br/>You can only describe this psychological thriller as weird. You are unsure of anyone's status at the conclusion. It's left to the audience to decide. This film has a few jump scares, but teeters on something more, like Mother! Viewers will wonder why Sasha doesn't leave the town. It's not until later that you learn that she is reeling from a miscarriage. The film should come with a trigger warning because the miscarriage scene is graphic. The other effects are practical but effective. The climax follows the thriller arc, but the disappointing conclusion ends like an independent film. Well, at least you get a hammer to the head twice.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
