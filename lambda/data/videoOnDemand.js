		"mtitle":"A Wesley Christmas Wedding",
		"review":"This year, the Wesleys have a lot to celebrate. Sylvia and Bryan made time for each other and traveled throughout the year. Chris and Trina added a beautiful baby boy to their family, and Ryan and Todd got engaged. Marcus moved in with Gloria while they attended group therapy for veterans. Cydney is ready to leave the road and return home to celebrate the holiday and nuptials.<br/><br/>Trina and Chris's daughters, Kennedy and Taryn, arrive from college with a surprise. Kennedy brought her new boyfriend, Rico, to spend the holidays with them. Taryn dislikes Rico but doesn't speak up to their parents. If Taryrn tells their parents Rico is a bum, Kennedy will spill Taryn's secret.<br/><br/>The Wesley women meet at the ballroom before Todd and Ryan's engagement party. They can't believe Ryan's mother, Diana, changed the decorations. During the party, Diana focuses the party on her but hates the ghastly holiday-themed decor. The MC calls for friends and family to make toast for the engaged, and Todd's ex-wife, Janelle, grabs the microphone to introduce herself as Todd's wife. She admits that she never signed the papers and deserves everything Todd is doing for Ryan. Ryan overhears them and gives Todd his ring back. Will there be a Wesley Christmas Wedding?<br/><br/>This sequel provides drama and hilarious moments with the Wesley Bunch and DC Go-Go. The heads of the family have found their groove, but Sylvia must deal with another woman in the family. Diana has a vision for Ryan's wedding and won't let anyone, including Ryan, stand in her way. The script covers PTSD and postpartum depression honestly and respectfully. This movie, like its predecessor, balances these series topics with pearl-clutching humor. You should watch the first before viewing the second to familiarize yourself with the family and their friends.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Donovan kisses his wife, Simone, before she leaves the house for her flight. Donovan sits at his desk and converses with his co-workers, Lauren and Graham. After their meeting, Donovan gets a phone call from a lawyer. His aunt Velma passed away ten years ago. Donovan hasn't seen his Uncle Rufus and Aunt Velma since he was young. He knew Rufus died in 1968 but had no idea about Velma's passing. Rufus and Velma had property filled with personal items. So, Donovan has to visit Georgia to finalize the estate.<br/><br/>Donovan arrives in Blue Ridge, Georgia, and most locals don't hide their disdain. Donovan decides to sell the home but can't find a real estate agent to take on the property. He visits the property and finds his old toys, a box of toothpicks, and a chicken's foot. Donovan looks up and sees Rufus in front of him. Rufus possesses his body. In 1968, two men lynched Rufus because he wouldn't give up his home. Before Rufus died, he put a voodoo protection spell on his family. Now, his spirit has taken over Donovan's body to seek revenge on those who killed him and their children. Is anyone safe from Rufus's wrath?<br/><br/>This movie isn't a horror or a thriller. It's a paranormal revenge story that allows you to cheer for the 'villain.' Rufus's targets are deserving so you won't have a problem with the bloodshed. If you watch closely, Rufus isn't the only ghost seeking vengeance. Velma wants justice. If you want something to watch for the Halloween season but with less gore, this is your film.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"If You Were The Last",
		"review":"For three years, astronauts Adam and Jane aimlessly float in space. Jane doesn't believe that NASA is looking for them but Adam has hope. They have a goat, chickens, pop tarts, and weed to keep them busy. Jane questions Adam about a milky substance she stepped on next to the garden. He apologizes because he thought he cleaned it up. She admits to pleasuring herself, but only in her bedroom, not in front of the chickens and their food. He tosses out the idea of them sleeping together. She laughs, says no, and gives three reasons why not. Will they give in, or will they return first?<br/><br/>This movie is The Martian, with simple graphics and two people. And it's The Mountain Between Us but funny. Adam convinces Jane to watch The Princess Bride and listen to country music while line dancing. And Jane gets him to watch Alien in outer space and sing Lionel Richie. The ending is predictable, but the journey is thrilling. The director displayed their relationship through a series of montages and running gags. The comedy will keep you watching, but the sweet predictability loses your interest by the conclusion.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Burial",
		"review":"After his 75th birthday, Jeremiah O'Keefe gets a visit from the State Insurance Commission. Jeremiah runs eight funeral homes and sells insurance but doesn't have the required reserve in his account. The commission warns Jeremiah to replenish his account or face heavy penalties. Jeremiah sits with his lawyer, Mike, to plan how to fix the problem. Mike reminds Jeremiah that Ray Loewen from The Loewen Group bought funeral homes around town and can make Jeremiah a fair offer.<br/><br/>Mike and Jeremiah meet at the airport to fly to Vancouver to converse with Ray, but Jeremiah has a surprise. Jeremiah hired Hal, a young attorney, to accompany them. They meet with Ray on his boat, and Ray offers to buy three funeral homes but never sell insurance in southern Mississippi. Ray and Jeremiah shake on the deal, but almost a year later, Ray hasn't signed it. Hal thinks Ray is purposefully stalling to bankrupt Jeremiah. Jeremiah wants to sue Ray. Hal doesn't think Mike is the right lawyer to try the case. Hal puts a videotape of Willie Gary into Jeremiah's VCR.<br/><br/>Jeremiah watches Willie work a case and loves his delivery and bravado. So, Jeremiah and Hal go to Willie to hire him. Willie declines the case, and Hal and Jeremiah leave Willie's office. Hal tells Willie that winning this case will make him internationally famous because Jeremiah is the tip of the iceberg. Willie takes the case and travels to meet Jeremiah's team.<br/><br/>Mike meets with Willie and discloses an offer he presented to Ray for $9 million. Willie says the deal is off the table because he wants $100 million. Ray's team looks at the area demographics and don't think they can win without finding a lawyer to appeal to the jury. Ray has a lawyer in mind: Mame Downes. Willie's desire to win the case will uncover a disgraceful misuse of trust, discriminatory pricing, and long-overdue justice.<br/><br/>Based on The Burial by Jonathan Harr, this movie packs drama and fun to lighten the mood about racism and classism. When you watch, remember that this film wasn't in the 1960s. It's 1995. The Loewen Group overcharged people during their worst moments after selling worthless insurance. They aligned themselves with the local churches to gain trust in the community. The movie also depicts how Ray and Jeremiah started in the same position. They inherited businesses from their father and worked hard to grow them. The final judgment will shock you. Stay until the mid-credits to get a glimpse of the real-life Willie.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
