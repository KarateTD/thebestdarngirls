		"mtitle":"First Lady of BMF: The Tonesa Welch Story",
		"review":"Tonesa's mother, Carol, and stepfather, Emerson, agree to watch her son, Little Marlon, while she goes to a club with her friends, Carla and Lisa. Tonesa switches into something more provocative and heads out for a fun night. As one man approaches Tonesa, another, Harvey, scares him away. Harvey offers Tonesa some champagne, and they have an instant spark.<br/><br/>Tonesa sneaks out to meet Harvey and leaves Little Marlon behind. Harvey showers Tonesa with money, gifts, and attention. Tonesa dumps her long-distance boyfriend, Big Marlon, for Harvey and moves in with him. One day, Harvey comes home and puts his gun on the table. She confesses that she wants to be a part of his crew and sell drugs. But Harvey says no because he has another plan for her. He wants her to write bad checks.<br/><br/>Tonesa does great scamming for Harvey, but it's not enough. So Harvey teaches her the drug trade, and they expand their territory. They move into a new home, and Tonesa comes up with a new idea. She wants to increase their market to the West because they have money to burn. Harvey ponders her idea and slaps her. Harvey offers Tonesa drugs to dull the pain. Despite her parents' warning, Tonesa willingly slides down a razor's edge into a life of abuse, drugs, money, and jail.<br/><br/>Tonesa matures throughout this film. At first, she blames her parents for holding her back. Then, she accuses her husband and boyfriends. Finally, Tonesa takes a long look at herself. She had something special that made her the first lady of BMF: her tenacity and woman's intuition. Tonesa earns a legitimate living today and works to help other recently released prisoners return to society. The film uses technology, wardrobe, slang, and hair to recreate the period. And it doesn't glamorize her past. It provides an honest look at her decisions, life, consequences, and redemption.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Cameron interrupts his sister's birthday party at the hottest Atlanta club. His sister, Destiny, prepares to argue but stops when Cameron gives her devastating news. The FAA declared their father, Dexter, dead after a plane crash. Cameron and Destiny meet with their stepmother, Corynne, at their father's company, Granite Slate Holdings, in the morning. The corporate attorney, Blake, sits everyone down and briefs them on Dexter's will. Dexter left everything to Corynne, making her the CEO. Corynne cut their salary by 50%, canceled their personal and corporate credit cards, and won't pay for Destiny's apartment. Before they leave, Detective Howard updates the family on the FAA finding. It wasn't a pilot error that caused the plane crash. It was a faulty part. However, the maintenance crew said it was new. The police believe someone tampered with it and classified Dexter's death as a homicide.<br/><br/>Destiny saunters into Cameron's home with bags in tow. Destiny has more on her mind than living arrangements. She wants to take back her father's company. Destiny recalls that Cameron and their stepsister, Lauren, had a fling. They can take over the company and appoint a new CEO with their combined shares. But if Cameron fails, he will give his shares to Destiny. The two shake on their devious plan but keep a dagger behind their backs.<br/><br/>Buy some pearls for this movie because you need something to clutch. The audacity is extreme in this family, and they have zero shame. Their devilish behavior isn't new for them. Their father's death only unleashed the beast. This movie takes a TV series of twists and turns and compacts them into less than 2 hours. The plot has no loose ends but begs for and deserves a part two.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Doctor Landon is a successful OB GYN with a flourishing clinic. Liv is an interior decorator with a thriving business and happy customers.

Liv bumps into Alexis, and Alexis confesses. She is a marriage counselor and overheard her problems with Landon. Alexis believes she can help them because she has a 99% success rate. Alexis gives Liv her business card and leaves.<br/><br/>Liv reconsiders having children after her latest miscarriage. Liv cries and pulls out Alexis's card. She calls Alexis to make an appointment and breathes a sigh of relief. She hopes this call will repair her marriage, but it could end her life.<br/><br/>The plot feels familiar, but the lead doesn't follow the blueprint. At first, Liv trusts Alexis and follows her advice from their therapy session. However, Liv reconsiders when she spots changes in her life. She questions everyone around her, gathers evidence, and does her research. This film leaves the plot open for a sequel, but it's unnecessary.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
