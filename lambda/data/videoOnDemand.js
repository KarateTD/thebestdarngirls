		"review": "Kate pushed away her dreams of becoming a Boston architect after she met Everett. She moved with him to his small town, Winterlight, so that he could open his medical practice. They had two kids, Gabe and Sienna, and Kate became the local handywoman. However, Kate and Everett grew apart. And now they want a divorce. Kate plans to spend this holiday the same as the others so that it won't affect their children.<br/><br/>Kate has prepared a traditional meal to welcome her family's arrival. She greets Sienna's new boyfriend, Nigel, and her father-in-laws, Mike and Darryl. During the meal, Nigel slips about Everett's new girlfriend, Tess. Everyone knew, except Katie. She can't believe it and pretends to be okay. She has a secret too. She will sell the family home and move to Boston to reclaim her career. Despite Kate and Everett's wishes, this family holiday will not be a traditional one.<br/><br/>This film has the classic Lifetme holiday plot with bigger stars. Otherwise, it wouldn't be on Netflix. The supporting cast is the funniest part of this movie. Also, the grandfathers judging the gingerbread competition will rival the Food Network. Tess has the most relatable crash-out in a holiday film. If you like predictability with a few smirks, this picture is for you.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Playdate",
		"review": "Brian wants to find a way to bond with his step-son, Lucas. He coached Lucas's lacrosse team, but that was a flop. Brian takes Lucas out to play catch and sees Jeff throw a football to his son, CJ. Brian can't believe the father and son's level of expertise. Jeff comes over to help Brian and Lucas with their game. The two boys find commonality and arrange a playdate at Jeff's house. Brian cringes, but Jeff loves the idea.<br/><br/>The boys run to the backyard while Brian tries to bond with Jeff. Jeff reveals that CJ's mom died, and they moved to start over. As Brian finds holes in Jeff's story, CJ and Lucas return because someone was staring at them. Jeff instantly decides to go to a Buckey Cheese with the kids. Everyone jumps in Jeff's car, but Brian still feels that something is off.<br/><br/>As the boys play, Jeff watches a man enter. He follows the man to the back while CJ and Lucas return for pizza. Brian asks CJ about his dad, but CJ replies that Jeff isn't his dad. Brian runs to the front door, but the attendant won't let him leave because their wrist bands don't match. He tries to explain, but the attendant doesn't believe him. When Jeff returns, CJ pretends not to know Brian or Lucas. They run off, and the attendant reports it as a kidnapping.<br/><br/>In the car, Jeff explains what happened. He was working at a secure facility when he heard a sound from inside a room. It was CJ. He realized they were experimenting on the kid, so Jeff broke him out. Now, CJ's creators are coming for him. Brian wants to leave, but he sees an amber alert with his picture. Jeff loves working with his new best friend, but Brian hates being a man on the run. Can Brian and Jeff save themselves and CJ?<br/><br/>This film is an outlandish time with plot holes, hijinks, basic graphics, and cheesy jokes. It contains the standard secret agent in the suburbs storyline. The foreshadowing is the most painful part of this story. The Mamma Mafia is hilarious. And the running Odyssey joke is made for suburbia. Parents should watch this movie before determining if it's safe for their tween or older child. This picture is for anyone who wants mindless fun with kids and campy jokes.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "A House of Dynamite",
		"review": "Major Daniel Gonzalez ends a tense call with his wife and enters the 59th Missile Defense Battalion on a base in Alaska. It's a typical day of playful banter, serious conversations, and monitoring the screens. Then, someone sees a missile with no origin or explanation on the monitor. They contact Captain Olivia Walker in the White House Situation Room. Major Gonzalez follows protocol and launches a Ground-Based Interceptor. Sadly, it misses the missile. And based on their calculations, it's headed for Illinois, and millions will lose their life if they can't stop it or uncover who is responsible.<br/><br/>Deputy National Security Officer Jake Baerington rides with his pregnant wife to work as he receives a call because his boss is out for a medical procedure. They need Jake to speak with foreign dignitaries. The United States's enemies and allies see a country preparing to shoot down the missile. White House officials believe Russia is colluding with North Korea to start the conflict to regain bargaining power. Jake tries to build trust, but Russia ends the call. Jake contacts the President to update him.<br/><br/>The President of the United States calls his wife, who's visiting Kenya. Later, he leaves the White House for a photo opportunity with a girls' youth basketball league. He gives an inspiring speech to the young women before his secret service pulls him away. An unknown actor launched a missile at the United States. The President has minutes to decide what to do. Lieutenant Commander Robert Reeves opens up his briefcase. It houses the nuclear football. He updates the President on his options, but all have dire consequences. The President requests a minute to think with 2 minutes before impact. What will be left?<br/><br/>This film covers the same 18 minutes from three perspectives. Their titles are Inclination is Flattening, Hitting a Bullet with a Bullet, and A House of Dynamite. This setup allows the audience to get a brief glimpse into the characters' private lives before the day turns into a chaotic rollercoaster. The writers made careful and strategic decisions about the script. First, they never mention anyone's political affiliations. Second, the writers never label the attacker or explain why. The director wanted the film to spark a conversation about the U.S. and the World's nuclear programs. However, the unknown ending forces the viewer to focus on the conclusion, ignoring a potential solution. The film stresses you to the limit but leaves you with more questions than answers. This movie is for people who want to watch a human chess match with real-life pawns.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

She sadly reports that Sam will never see Finn again. Sam won't accept that. He will get his brother back. Luckily, Becca knows someone who can help, the local drunk Rusty. But they will have to convince him. Can Sam save Finn?<br/><br/>Based on R.L. Stine's novel Pumpkinhead, this film is a thriller with a bit of horror. The plot is well-written with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. The pacing is flawless, and the script makes fun of itself. With all R.L. Stine books, there is a larger lesson at hand. It speaks of family, responsibility, and sacrifice. This film is the perfect Halloween movie for the family. It doesn't have any sexual innuendoes, off-color language, or political putdowns, only fright with a lesson.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Alonzo prevents his son, Trent, from getting into a fight with local gangbangers. He pulls Trent away and admonishes him for not following directions. Trent points out that Alonzo is usually away serving his country. He had no idea his father would be back today. Alonzo is home now and ready to relax.<br/><br/>Officers Erin and Michelle walk the beat to keep the streets safe for shop owners like Ms. Crystal, Mr. Troy, and Mr. Trin. The local kingpin, Raw Dog, is enemy number one for Erin. Pastor Zeke heads a men's prayer group when the room shakes. Alonzo, Trent, and Daphne feel the tremors at home, too. Then, the news reports of an invasion. Alonzo admits that the government heard chatter about a sleeper cell called Orochi. Orochi plans to take over America one city at a time. They chose Compton because they think the citizens don't care about the community or the people. They are going to learn the hard way that Compton is ready to fight.<br/><br/>Of all the places to invade, they pick Compton. Any viewer knows this will end badly. While the invasion is the main point of the story, the subplot tackles community issues and parenting. The actors did the script justice by conveying pure, unadulterated emotions with each heartfelt and panicked line. The casting department signed on the heavy-hitters from every genre. Now, the plot loses it with the graphics and robots. The drones and firepower were believable, but the other technology turns this film into science fiction. Some of the post graphics are over-the-top. This movie is an enjoyable apocalyptic thriller.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
