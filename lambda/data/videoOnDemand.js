		"review": "Firefighter Sam kisses her boyfriend, Noah, and drives to work. Before her day starts, Sam discovers she left her badge at home. Sam rushes to her home and hears the shower running. She assumes it's Noah and enters the bedroom to retrieve her badge. She sees Noah asleep on the bed. She opens the bathroom door and sees a woman's bra hanging off the shower frame. Sam rushes out of the house with Noah pleading after her. She refuses to accept his apology and goes to work. Her friend, Diane, calls. Their friend, Shannon, returned from her latest deployment. Diane wants to celebrate. Sam explains her heartbreak, but Diane expresses that Sam must party her sadness away.<br/><br/>Diane and Shannon attempt to lift Sam's spirits, but nothing helps. So, Diane calls her friend Cody. Cody runs the White Stallion Ranch and has a discounted, last-minute getaway. Sam begrudgingly says yes.<br/><br/>They arrive at the ranch and let loose. Cody made some calls and got the women an off-highway vehicle. They ride until the OHV stalls. Then, they check their phones and discover they don't have cell service. Shannon says they should walk. Diane, Shannon, and Sam travel to an airplane graveyard. They investigate the area, and a man, A.K.A., points a gun at them. His plane went down in the area, and he couldn't get a signal. The women refuse to accept their fate and look around the area. Shannon sees an antenna on the property and discerns that the manual override switch is nearby.<br/><br/>Shannon and Sam find the override and turn on the antenna. Then, a pod opens, and a woman, Gwen, exits it. She went missing 100 years ago. She remembers being on a ship and aliens stealing her likeness. Now, the group knows they are in deep trouble. They didn't save their lives. Instead, they sparked an alien invasion. Can they survive and save the world?<br/><br/>BET+'s first jump into the sci-fi genre offered great characters and graphics reminiscent of cult classics. Shannon, Sam, and Diane have deep backstories for the film's short running time and a close bond. One moment between two women could have fallen into the stereotype of fighting and slapping. However, they maturely converse, reveal mistakes, acknowledge shortcomings, apologize, and focus on their task. The writing makes up for the graphics and hazy film choice. The writers want to make a deeper statement, but it gets lost. While this won't be a BET favorite, it could become a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Stephanie is a crime-fighting vlogger with a new book, The Flawless Blonde. She has a reading and signing at a local bookstore. During the reading, Stephanie gets the shock of her life. After getting parole, Emily walks through the door in a jail-sheek outfit, including the chains. She asks Emily to be her maid of honor for her and her fiancé. Stephanie agrees after Emily threatens to sue Stephanie for using her likeness without permission.<br/><br/>Stephanie arrives in Capri and meets Emily's fiancé, Dante, and Dante's mother, Portia. As Stephanie greets the guests, she bumps into Emily's ex-husband, Sean, and their son, Nicky. Stephanie records during the welcome party, and several armed guards force her to stop. Stephanie discovers that Dante has a mob lineage and money.<br/><br/>Portia stands in front of the guests and announces that she has a gift for her future daughter-in-law. Emily's face drops when she sees her mother, Margaret, with another woman. The woman is Emily's aunt, Linda. Linda helped deliver the triplets. Sean laughs at Emily's family situation and states that Nicky will be immune because he's seeking full custody. Emily threatens Sean before he leaves.<br/><br/>Stephanie attends Emily's bachelorette party and walks to her room. She sees Nicky pounding on Sean's door because he forgot his key. Stephanie finds a maid to let her inside. The maid screams as they find Sean's body on the bathroom floor with blood coming out of his eyes. The Italian police label his death an accident, but Stephanie believes Emily killed him.<br/><br/>Stephanie's surprised to see the wedding continue without skipping a beat for Sean's death. She takes her martini and walks over to the shed. She sees Dante arguing with someone in the shadows. The culprit shoots him. Everyone has someone to vouch for their whereabouts during Dante's murder. Well, everyone except Stephanie. The Italian police put Stephanie under house arrest until they obtain enough evidence. Can Stephanie clear her name and find the culprit before they send her to prison?<br/><br/>This sequel has a higher body count but transforms a complex plot into a Lifetime movie. The mystery following the first murder regains your interest. However, the plot gives the viewers the breadcrumbs too early. The hair, makeup, and costumes are runway quality and have you envying both leads. And the 'Emily shot' of Stephanie will make you chuckle. This film doesn't surpass its predecessor, but it found a perfect place on Prime Video.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Plant Geneticist Dani works at Veredent Solutions with her mentor, owner Victoria. Victoria admires Dani's monogrammed pink latex gloves while watching a report on Marcus. Marcus worked at Acava Biopharmaceuticals, and someone murdered him during a home invasion. Dani offers to ask her finacé, Jordan, if he has ever encountered Marcus.<br/><br/>Dani meets Jordan at home after speaking to teens at a community center. He admits to never meeting Marcus but offers to ask around about him. Dani works late the next day, so Jordan makes her dinner and puts it in the fridge. She tells him to exclude anything spicy. Dani takes the meal to work and chokes after drinking Jordan's punch. He put pepper in it. Dani texts Jordan that she is going to kill him. Then, Dani informs Victoria that Jordan promised to question co-workers about Marcus.<br/><br/>Dani arrives at home but chooses not to go through the front door. She wants to retaliate and prank Jordan. She finds him on the floor, foaming at the mouth, and calls 911.<br/><br/>Detective Nadine and Lance interview Dani, but they don't believe her story about the intruder because there wasn't forced entry. They arrest Dani after discovering her text message threatening to kill him and bring her to the station. Dani panics when they question her with mounting evidence. Someone set her up to take the fall. But she must figure out who and why. So, Dani escapes police custody. Can she find Jordan's killer before the police find her?<br/><br/>This mystery allows the audience to know the killer without the motive. It circles back to every insignificant conversation. The recap happens quickly, so viewers must pay attention. The fight scenes are a bit overdramatic. The quips and fights will cause you to laugh more than worry about Dani's safety. The plot is far-fetched, but the film is an entertaining enigma.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "It's been fifteen years since Nyna worked in the studio. She loved singing and was on her way to stardom until a producer, Von, assaulted her. Now, Nyna does drugs, works as a bottle girl, and sells her body for money. Her saving grace is her daughter, Lizzy. Nyna asks her friend, Tamara, to watch Lizzy. She works at the bar and considers going home with a man, but changes her mind to spend more time with Lizzy. Nyna walks to the subway station.<br/><br/>Darin Blackstone, head of Blackstone Records, and musical artist Vito arrive at the rehab center to pick up Darin's brother, producer Jesse. Jesse went into a downward spiral after their father died. He jumps into the vehicle to run from reporters and rides to the record label. Darin gives Jesse his first artist, Rizzy Ray. Jesse listens to her raps and hates them. Darin loves Rizzy because she has over a million followers. Jesse wants to relax at home after a long night in the studio. Vito offers to give Jesse a ride, but Jesse chooses the train.<br/><br/>Nyna finds her friend, Avon, singing on the platform and joins in. Jesse, on the other side, hears Nyna. Jesse runs to the other side, but it's too late. Nyna is gone. However, Avon gives Jesse Nyna's Instagram handle. Jesse shows Darin some of Nyna's posts, but Darin isn't impressed because she doesn't have enough followers. With Vito's assistance, Jesse tracks Nyna to a park. Jesse pulls Nyna aside and guarantees her dreams will become reality. He only wants her to sing. And he will produce the record independently. Can Nyna and Jesse overcome their past and take the music world by storm?<br/><br/>This film deserves a soundtrack. Jesse and Nyna are two sides of the same coin. Both struggle with addiction and loss. It's Lizzy who pulls them together and allows them to trust. The acting shines a light on the industry. While many hunger for soul music, the industry pushes clickbait. Today, fans live in a world of algorithms that force commonality instead of individuality. The director makes cinematic choices to have Nyna stare into the camera during panic, loss, and fear. Viewers can feel her slipping away and asking for help. This film is art.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
