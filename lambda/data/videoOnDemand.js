He wats to see wht the fuss is about and convinces Morgan to go.  The two decide the club isn't for them but make love on the car ride home.  Isabelle weasels her way into their lives until the 3 make love.  The morning after, Isabelle is in love with the couple but they don't reciprocate.  Heartbroken, she will do anything to be a part of their family.<br/><br/>This movie maybe to spicy and to real for Lifetime.  The plot is wild but it is grounded in truth based on the public backlash.  In today's world, you realy go beyond the video tape.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
