		"review": "Jerome cuts hair with his brother, Bryson. Their cousin, Lavar, brags about the many women who bought him gifts for Christmas. Jerome and Bryson laugh at Lavar because they are in committed relationships. Bryson will finally bring his new girlfriend, Cree, to meet his family. For the first time, Jerome will bring his wife, Kayla. Newlyweds Jerome and Kayla typically spend the holidays with their respective families. Jerome can't wait for Kayla to spend time with his family and their traditions.<br/><br/>Kayla decorates her tree when her brother, LeeLee, calls. His tour got canceled, and he's home for the holidays. With LeeLee in town, Kayla knows their mother, Regina, will want them to spend the holidays together. LeeLee decides to ask Jerome to spend Christmas with her family instead of his.<br/><br/>Kayla prepares Jerome dessert for dinner, and he knows something isn't right. She tells him that her family expects her to be with them from the holidays. She asks Jerome to consider canceling his plans and spending time with hers. Jerome jokes that the only solution is for them to be in two places simultaneously. Kayla takes him seriously and creates a game plan. They will celebrate with both families without them knowing. They will make elaborate ruses to leave and return on a schedule. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This comedy will hit home for new couples. Jerome and Kayla spend the holidays apart during their relationship. So, their families never expected things to change. It's a plausible plan, but they forgot one glaring factor: their families. Lavar has a history with Cree, Pastor Davis doesn't accept LeeLee, and Kayla bought the wrong cookies. The plot balances humor with compassion exceptionally. It will make you laugh, clutch your pearls, and hug a loved one. This film could become a series with the proper script.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
