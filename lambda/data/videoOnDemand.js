		"mtitle": "Turtles All The Way Down",
		"review": "Aza's therapist considers several forms of therapy after Aza admits to opening her callus again. Aza confesses to taking her medication sporadically but won't consider Exposure Response Therapy for her Contamination OCD. Aza eats lunch with her best friend, Daisy, at school but runs out of the cafeteria because she thinks her stomach is too loud. Aza furiously washes her hands, removes her band-aid, opens her callus, and puts soap into the wound. Her thoughts ease. Daisy plans to meet Aza after school at the most posh restaurant in town: Applebee's.<br/><br/>As they eat their burgers, Aza and Daisy overhear a news report about Russell Davis Pickett. Russell is a fugitive billionaire with several white-collar crimes to his name. He left his two sons, Davis and Noah, behind. The police issued a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Daisy remembers that Aza met Davis at a camp for children coping with loss. Aza remembers Davis got a web camera for his 13th birthday. They put it in a tree on his property. Daisy wants to sync to it and examine the photos for evidence.<br/><br/>Aza and Daisy find the camera and sync with it. However, a groundskeeper discovers them and brings them to the Pickett's home. Davis remembers Aza, and Daisy observes he's smitten. Daisy wants Aza to keep up the conversation with Davis. They can return to the belly of the beast, investigate Russell's disappearance, and receive the reward money. However, Aza worries about becoming close to Davis and potentially having his microbiome inside her. Can Daisy and Aza find Russell without Aza spiraling?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Turtles All The Way Down by John Green, this adaptation draws you into Aza's spiral while keeping her human. The script doesn't depict Aza as all-knowing or perfect. She has flaws, and her OCD impacts everyone around her. Later, Daisy's fan fiction feels harsh. But when Daisy questions Aza about her personal life, Aza flounders. It's a complex and necessary conversation for these friends and exposes the faults in their friendship. Also, viewers get a mystery. This film ends like most of John Green's books, with an honest, compelling, hopeful, and wholehearted conclusion. It will leave a mark and conversation for the audience.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Shirley",
		"review": "Shirley Chisholm joined the new class of the 91st Congress of the United States in 1968. She stands out because she is the 1st African American woman to achieve this goal. Representing New York's 12th district, Shirley wanted to encourage the marginalized to vote.<br/><br/>After a few years in Congress, Mac Holder and Arthur Hardwick Jr. visit Shirley and her husband, Conrad, with startling information. Shirley promised to put her name on the primary ballot if her Floridian staffers raised $5,000. Mac informs Shirley that they raised nearly $10,000. Arthur will handle finances, Conrad will cover security, and Mac will advise her. Shirley knows they are a formidable force. However, this is the first year people 18 to 20 can vote. So, Shirley hires her former intern, Robert Gottlieb, as her national student coordinator. Later, Shirley employs a young and unregistered Barbara Lee. Shirley's bold political moves will change California's voting landscape, media coverage, and the Democratic National Committee.<br/><br/>Shirley wanted the world to know she was more than an African American and more than a woman. She was proud of both things but never allowed it to become her only identity. She wanted to be a voice of people ignored by politicians. She refused to hear the word 'can't' and quickly learned political inner workings and backdoor dealings. She understood that making history was significant but not as much as change. By standing up for herself, Shirley proudly leveled the playing field for all. This film covers a few years of her life but beautifully embraces the impact she made.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
