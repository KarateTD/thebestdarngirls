		"mtitle": "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery",
		"review": "Detective Benoit Blanc ignites a fire before sitting to read a letter written by Reverend Jud Duplenticy. Months earlier, Bishop Langstrom reassigned Jud to Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude after Jud punched another rude Reverend. Langstrom informed Jud that Monsignor Jefferson Wicks runs the church, but his parish is aging and small.<br/><br/>The parish has a few faithful followers. Martha handles every administrative task at the church. She grew up under the tutelage of Wicks's grandfather, Reverend Prentice. Martha's devotee and lover is the groundskeeper, Samson. Samson and Jefferson stopped drinking together, and living on the property keeps them accountable.<br/><br/>Doctor Nathaniel Sharp used to come to the church with his wife, Darla, every Sunday, until she left him. Now, he prays she returns while taking care of the townspeople, including Jefferson. Attorney Vera Draven took over her father's practice and place in the church after he died. She is still a dutiful daughter and handles the church's legal matters. When her father came home with a young boy, Cy, he told Vera to raise him as her own. Everyone assumes he's Mr. Draven's illegitimate child, but no one speaks of it. Cy returned home after losing a political bid. Now, he uploads Jefferson's sermons on YouTube.<br/><br/>Best-selling author Lee Ross's sales have been declining steadily. He wants to write a book about Jefferson and follows him around to collect details. Cellist Simone Vivane hasn't been able to play after a terrible accident left her with constant pain. She will pay to get a cure.<br/><br/>During the Good Friday service, Jefferson was in full form. He needed a break to fortify himself, so he went into the storage closet beside the pulpit as Jud prayed over the flock. Soon, everyone heard a thud from the closet. Jud ran inside and found Jefferson bleeding with a devil-shaped object protruding from his back. Dr. Nathaniel tells Jud not to touch the body. He runs inside, examines the body, declares Jefferson's death, and pulls the knife from his body. Police Chief Geraldine investigates the crime. She doesn't know how a man can enter a closet alone and be a murder victim. Will Benoit Blanc be able to solve it?<br/><br/>This standalone third film rivals the first. It has a compelling set of characters with rich backstories and an intriguing victim. Unlike the past, the plot doesn't revolve around Benoit. Also, the lighting and set design matched Jud's mood. It pulls you into the mystery without overpowering it. The director made a memorable choice when Jud lifted his bloody hand to the screen. It's a call back to so many movies we know and love. The 'why' and 'how' drive the story, but you will figure out 'who.' But their crime is so juicy, you won't care. Don't miss this latest Knives Out mystery.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Never Alone for Christmas: Memphis",
		"review": "Monica promotes her dating app and matchmaking business on Morning Memphis, co-hosted by her fiancé, Pierre. During the show, Monica alerts the audience that December 11th is the day most couples break up, warning them not to fall victim and end up spending Christmas alone. After this, Pierre announces that he and Monica will get married during the show's Christmas Eve taping. Later, at a café, Pierre tells Monica he wants a more traditional marriage to symbolize their success and expects her to end her business once they marry. Monica refuses and returns the ring.<br/><br/>The next day on the show, Pierre tells the audience that the wedding is off and that Monica broke up with him on December 11th. He cries for the cameras, leading Monica to lose all her clients. Soon after, Monica gets a call from Joe, who asks for her matchmaking services. She tells him the business is closed and hangs up. Later, after reflecting on Pierre's harsh words to viewers to 'not be a loser,' Monica reconsiders and calls Joe back to arrange an appointment.<br/><br/>Monica sits in the corner as Joe trips into the room. He has zero confidence, is clumsy, and has no social skills. However, he loves Christmas, working for charities, and his church. He wants to have a date for his office Christmas party. Monica promises to help him find the right woman. She assists him with his self-esteem, attire, and presence, but is she creating the perfect man for herself?<br/><br/>This standalone sequel allows the love to grow organically. Viewers will have sympathy for Joe. He means well. But his exterior doesn't match his heart. The script properly balances the holiday with comedy, love, and fellowship. They handle faith without alienating others. And add the right touch of hope for the viewers. You will watch this film with a smile on your face and joy in your heart. And let's not forget an original song from K. Michelle to ring in the holiday cheer.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Love After Holidays",
		"review": "Stephan took custody of his daughter, Sky, after police arrested Sky's mother, Janeen, for drunk driving with Sky in the car. The courts ordered Janeen to undergo mandated therapy with Dr. Cunningham. On her latest visit, she brought a flask, and he told her to leave. Janeen rushes to her show, 'Love After,' and gets prepped for hair and makeup. The producer, Morris, pulled two random audience members to get advice from Janeen. One is kind, but the other is confrontational. She points out Janeen's police record, custody loss, and upcoming divorce. Janeen gets physical with the guest before they cut to a commercial. Janeen's boss, Minerva, demands that Janeen get her act together. Janeen promises that her issues won't hinder her work. It will do much more. Janeen will suffer a downfall if she doesn't acknowledge her addiction and take accountability for her actions. Will she make it?<br/><br/>B.E.T Plus added this film to its holiday slot, but it barely mentions the holiday. It's better for awareness month than Christmas. This movie could trigger someone who has ever dealt with any aspect of addiction. The writing felt too genuine. It feels like the conversations were taken from actual events. This movie is reminiscent of after-school specials, not a Christmas movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Oh. What. Fun.",
		"review": "Claire uses recipes from a cookbook of her favorite TV host, Zazzy Tims. She can't wait for her children to arrive. For months, she nudged them to write her in as an applicant for Zazzy's show. She is airing a special episode to celebrate the unsung hero of the holidays: moms. Her husband, Nick, tells her to fill out the form for herself, but Claire thinks that's cheating. For now, she will keep sending the link in text messages.<br/><br/>First, Claire welcomes her oldest, Channing. Channing is married to Doug, and they have twins, Lucy and Ben. Next, the youngest Sammy arrives. They thought he was bringing his girlfriend, Mae-bell, but she dumped him the day before to be with someone else. Finally, Taylor arrives with her annual new girlfriend, Donna. Everything is going to plan until Claire sees the pristine neighbor, Jeanne, across the street. Jeanne makes Claire feel inept. So, Claire does everything to outdo her. Jeanne gives Claire a three-wick candle. Since Claire's gift only has one wick, she lies and says it's not ready.<br/><br/>Claire plans a day with her family. They will see a Christmas Eve show of Ben and Lucy's favorite program, 'So You Think You're a Dancer.' Before the show, Claire grabs some peppermint bark, throws it in a bag, and walks over to Jeanne's home. As Jeanne examines the gift, she sees Claire's family leaving in two cars without Claire. Claire darts back inside the home and discovers her family has forgotten her. She puts her clothes in a duffel bag, unplugs the lawn inflatables, and drives away. When her family remembers Claire, she is long gone on a wild adventure. They know Christmas without her will be a disaster. Can they convince Claire to come home?<br/><br/>This film expresses that moms are the unsung heroes of the holidays because they handle the emotional labor for the family. They are the magic behind the holidays. The script wins because the family instantly sees they were wrong. They don't excuse their behavior or blame Claire. They acknowledge Claire's importance to the holiday and offer space and understanding. The film also spotlights the classic pictures, making dads heroes but not the moms. It will try to write those wrongs, but something is missing from the film. It loses some heart along the way.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Son of the Preacher",
		"review": "Jasmine uses her chemistry degree to create a natural hair care line, Halo and Honey. Her roommate, best friend India, tells Jasmine to dream big every time Jasmine questions her abilities. India knows the proper endorsement will launch the brand. An endorsement from someone like Caleb Samuels, known online as at Son Of The Preacher. His father, Reverend Samuels, heads the Kingdom of God church. Jasmine throws caution to the wind and goes to the church.<br/><br/>Caleb enters his father's office after service. Reverend Samuels is furious because Caleb came late and stayed in the back. He dreams of Caleb taking the reins but feels Caleb isn't serious about leading the flock. He believes Caleb is more interested in getting likes than saving souls. Caleb sees Jasmine at the front desk and listens to her spiel. He's not sure about the partnership, but invites her to his party so they can iron out the details. Jasmine agrees.<br/><br/>Jasmine arrives at Caleb's home. Caleb doesn't think it will fit with his brand and could cause him to lose followers. Then, Reverend Samuel breaks up the party. He's over Caleb's antics and cuts Caleb off. Caleb has until his birthday, on Christmas Day, to change the direction of his life. To get in the Reverend's good graces, Caleb takes a 3rd look at Jasmine's idea. She wants him to start a God Challenge campaign. Caleb believes this campaign will put him in his father's good graces and demonstrate the power of social media. This campaign will affect the church, impact the community, and change the Samuel's family forever.<br/><br/>Don't let this review fool you. It's a synopsis of this film's charming side. The script is gritty and salacious. It's reminiscent of Greenleaf with an affair, a greedy deal, and a stream of secrets. The writers properly balanced the drama with the Christmas spirit. The script highlights issues with the prosperity gospel without condemning it. This film is funny and pearl-clutching. It properly foreshadows without giving away the ending. B E T Plus proves you can add drama to the holidays and make it entertaining. This film will make you ask for a holiday series.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
