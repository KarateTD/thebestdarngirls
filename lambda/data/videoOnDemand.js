After a revealing meet-cute, Rachel runs into another transplant patient, Amy. Amy received Angela's kidney. When Amy learns Rachel has Angela's heart, Amy considers Rachel her sister. Scott told Amy that Rachel took his breath away. However, Rachel wants to leave Cheverly and return to LA for work. Rachel tries to escape, but her heart flutters. Something keeps holding Rachel back, and it's more than love.<br/><br/>The beginning will bring you to tears as Angela drifts away with a few parting words to a woman she will save but never know.
