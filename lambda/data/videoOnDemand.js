		"mtitle": "My Spy: The Eternal City",
		"review": "JJ cares for 14-year-old Sophie while her mother, Kate, works in Rwanda. JJ is a whiz in the kitchen since giving up field work to care for Sophie. She goes to school and trains with JJ in the afternoon. However, Sophie doesn't appreciate JJ's hands-on approach. She reminds JJ that he may play dad but isn't her father.<br/><br/>JJ and Bobbi keep watch of Christina while Christina retrieves the location of handheld nuclear weapons. Christina gets the information, puts them on a thumb drive, and escapes before operative soldiers find her. David praises JJ for completing step one but wants JJ in the field for the next step. JJ won't break his pinky promise to nine-year-old Sophie and rejects the job.<br/><br/>Sophie sings in the school choir while mooning over the lead singer, Ryan. She dreams of asking him to the homecoming dance. Sophie asks her friend, Collin, for assistance and a confidence boost. Their choir director alerts the choir they are on the shortlist to sing at the G7 summit in Vatican City.<br/><br/>JJ trains Sophie, but she misses her backflip several times. She decides to leave, but JJ worries she's quitting. Then, Sophie gets a text from her choir director. They are going to Italy.<br/><br/>Before boarding the buses, Sophie gives JJ the rules for the trip. Then, Sophie and JJ watch David drop off his son, Collin. Collin doesn't know his dad heads the CIA. JJ vows to keep an eye on Collin for David. The new Vice Principal, Nancy, confronts JJ about his duties during the trip. He is a first-time chaperone, and she worries he is ill-prepared.<br/><br/>JJ gets a warning from the tripwire he installed in front of Ryan's door. He catches Ryan, Collin, and Sophie sneaking out of the hotel. JJ allows them to leave. But they must return before Vice Principal Nancy catches them. Sophie and Ryan are having a wonderful time together and take a selfie. During the picture, Sophie notices someone pull Collin into a van, and she chases after the kidnapper. A motorcyclist almost hits Sophie during her pursuit, but JJ saves her. JJ looks at Sophie's images and identifies the kidnapper as Bishop Crane. Bishop got the thumb drive from Christina. Now, Bishop's boss wants David to get the launch codes from a secure facility. If he doesn't, they will kill Collin. They need to save the world and Collin.<br/><br/>The sequel to My Spy navigates complicated relationships with a fun mystery, comical action sequences, and attack finches. JJ doesn't have a dreamy adolescent. She is a young woman trying to spread her wings. Bobbi and Sophie maintain their semi-hostile but respectable relationship during the mission. And the boss's reveal is surprising. This film builds on the original and brings back the characters you love. While watching the first film is unnecessary, the plot has two humorous callbacks to the original. This movie isn't for younger children, but you and your teens will laugh.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

Before the guards capture her, Maddox Hatter saves her and brings her to his lab. Red wants to forge a path for herself. Then, Maddox shows Red his latest invention: a pocket watch time machine. Red hugs him and lifts the pocket watch before the Queen of Hearts summons her. At the plaza, the Queen of Hearts demands to know why the guard let the vigilante escape. The Queen forces Red to decide his fate. Before coming up with something more horrendous, Uma's invitation arrives. To Red's surprise, the Queen accepts.<br/><br/>Princess Red, the Queen of Hearts, Cinderella, and Chloe arrive for orientation.

Red and Chloe must stop Uliana to save Cinderella's life and Red's future.<br/><br/>Serving as the sequel to Beyond The Isle of the Lost by Melissa de la Cruz, this fourth installment of the Descendants franchise introduces new worlds, students, and villains while giving the audience a glimpse of the past. The opening sequence addresses the main characters' absence while paying homage to Cameron Boyce. Then, Red storms onto your screen with a song that will immerse you into the dark world of Wonderland. Chloe lives in King Charming's kingdom with rewards for goodness. Chloe, seeing Cinderella's teen angst and coldness, throws Chloe for a loop. While the storyline and the songs are flawless, you will want more to the story. The previous films had a twist. But this one film doesn't. This installment brings joy, songs, and lessons like its predecessors but feels half-done without the twist.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
