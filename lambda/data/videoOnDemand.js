		"review":"JT, Dean, and Wes celebrate Halloween like all kids do in 1999. They dress up, get candy, and play pranks. They place dog poop on the neighbor's porch, light it on fire, and run behind bushes to watch. However, the neighbors don't come out, and the fire grows. They try to put it out with a jacket but can't. They remove it and write 'Ricky Stanicky' on the collar. JT, Dean, and Wes get away with arson. Now, they want to blame everything on Ricky in the future to get out of trouble.<br/><br/>Today, Dean and his girlfriend, Erin, prepare for JT and Susan's baby shower. Then, Dean gets a message from Ricky. Ricky's cancer is back, and he wants his friends for support. Susan and Erin encourage Dean and JT to skip the baby shower and stand by Ricky's side while he gets surgery. Wes sent Ricky's texts from a secret phone. They turn off their phones and open their Ricky Bible on the flight. It documents all the lies so the men can keep track. They attend a concert and go to a bar for drinks. A man, Rod, slithers to the bar. They converse with Rod and discover he is an X-rated parody singer and actor working at a local club. Dean gets Rod's number, but JT blows Rod off. They turn on their phones and get a slew of text messages. Susan went into labor early, and Wes missed the baby's birth.<br/><br/>They arrive at the hospital, and Susan's mom, Leona, is furious at them and Ricky. Leona tells them to invite Ricky to the bris because he will be in town. The men feel trapped, but Dean offers a solution. He pulls Rod's business card from his pocket and gives Rod a call.<br/><br/>Rod leaves the stage, and someone warns Rod that two men are looking for him. Rod sees the goons in the audience and jumps out the window. He gets a call from Dean and accepts the job. Dean gives Rod the Ricky bible to study. They hope Rod will come to the party, shake hands, and leave forever. But what will they do when Rod wants to become Ricky?<br/><br/>It's unbelievable that these men kept the Ricky lie going for years. They have a phone and social media account for the Ricky persona. It's not until the lies affect their work and relationships that the men see the issue. Seeing the three men try to juggle their lives, the lie, Rod, and their relationships is a complicated but humorous balancing act. This movie has crass laughs but entertains. It will be a guilty pleasure for the Hangover crowd but not as memorable.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",
