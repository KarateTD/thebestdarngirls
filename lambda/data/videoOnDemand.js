		"review":"Meilin Lee is an intelligent and spirited 13-year-old who is ready to make her mark on the world.  Just don't tell her mother, Ming. Ming believes that Mei's number one priority is family, and she will be the U.N. Secretary-General.  Every day, Mei and Ming honor their eldest ancestor, Sun Yee, the guardian of the Red Panda, and receive prosperity.<br/><br/>After school, Mei's friends, Priya, Miriam, and Abby, ogle the convenience store clerk, Devon.  Mei doesn't think Devon holds a candle to any member of their favorite boy band, 4*Town.  Mei studies after work and doodles.  She notices her doodles look like Devon and obsessively draws romantic scenes with him.  Mei hears Ming at the door and pushes the notebook under her bed.  But Ming finds it and believes Devon accosted Mei.  Ming shows Mei's drawings to Devon and admonishes him for hurting Mei.  Thoroughly embarrassed but quiet, Mei returns home.<br/><br/>After a restless and nightmare-filled night, Mei wakes up, goes to the bathroom, and looks in the mirror.  She finds a giant red panda staring back at her.  Mei calms herself and changes back to her human form, except now Mei has red hair.  She realizes that she must keep calm to stop the change and goes to school with a hat to avoid Ming.<br/><br/>After passing notes, Miriam warns Mei that Ming is outside.  Mei freaks out when she sees Ming with feminine hygiene products, and the panda comes out.  She escapes through the window and runs home.  Ming meets Mei at home and comforts Mei, and Jin says he can't believe it happened so early.  Ming explains that the Red Panda gene passes from mother to daughter.  It started with Sun Yee.  While men fought in a war, the women, children, and the village were unprotected.  So Sun Yee asks the Gods to give her the power to defend the town and its inhabitants.  But there is a cure.  At the next red moon, Ming can perform a ritual to remove the panda from Mei.  The red moon will be on May 25th.<br/><br/>Concerned and with 4*Town news, Mei's friends come by her window to visit.  They tell her 4*Town is coming to Toronto on May 18th.  She unknowingly changes to the panda and pokes her head out the window.  Her friends are happy with her transformation and want to know more.  They all want to go to the concert, but it will cost $200 each and Mei must keep calm.  Mei thinks she can keep it under control with her friends around.  However, that hope is short-lived when a student bullies Mei.  Soon the whole school knows about the panda, but they want to pay for more.  Mei thinks she has everything figured out.  But when Mei has to choose between her friends' happiness or her family duties, her choice will unleash her family's true legacy.<br/><br/>Pixar keeps creating new and complex characters with real-world issues that ground them alongside mystical origins.  Her friends have distinct and loving personalities.  When they discover the truth, they don't shun her.  They embrace her and help Mei find inner peace.  The mix between traditional art, in the storytelling portions, and modern art is effortless.  Don't be so quick to judge.  The film appears to treat Ming as the antagonist, but the plot gets to the heart of her issues and controlling nature.  Now, this movie starts slow because you are anticipating the transformation.  But, the beginning is critical to understand the relationship between Mei, her family, and friends.  So be patient.  And let's not forget the hilarious post-credit scene.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Being the Ricardos",
		"review":"Lucille Ball waits for her husband, Desi Arnaz, with the morning paper in her hand.  When he comes through the door, she wants an explanation.  It shows him enjoying drinks and details a wild night out.  Desi looks at the paper and tells her it's an old picture of an event she with him attended months ago.  Lucy remembers and kisses Desi.  As they kiss, a news report comes over the radio.  A well-known T.V. star pledges her allegiance to the communist party.  Lucy is the most-popular woman or man on television.  They know the radio host is talking about Lucy.<br/><br/>Monday, Lucy and Desi go to the executives to convince them of the truth.  Lucy tells them that 20 years ago, she lived with her grandfather, who fought for the little guy.  She checked the communist box to please him.  Desi and Lucy leave the office and head to the table-read for episode 204 of I Love Lucy.  They believe the show is ok, but this will be the most trying week of their marriage, T.V. show, staff, and cast.<br/><br/>It might shock people today, but I Love Lucy was a groundbreaking and provocative show for its time.  Lucy played a dopey woman on T.V., but she was a comedic genius battling tooth and nail for her art.  However, this movie doesn't make Lucy look like an angel.  Her strong demeanor came at the cost of her writing staff and her co-stars, Vivian and Bill.  You don't need to know much about Lucy, Desi, or the show to enjoy this movie.  But you will want to watch the show afterward.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars",

		"mtitle":"Red Notice",
		"review":"Detective John Hartley is a criminal profiler with the FBI.  He is on the hunt for Nolan Booth, the most wanted thief in the world.  Interpol got a tip that Booth wants to steal Cleopatra's second egg.  When John proves the display egg is fake, he spots Booth and chases him.  Before John can get a hand on Booth, Booth slips away to his safe house.  Exactly where John is waiting for him.  John believes his work is complete until someone says the egg is fake.  John thinks it was Bishop who swapped it, but Interpol gets another tip and arrests John.  They lock John up in the same cell as Booth.  Before the fight, the captain pulls Booth and John out of their cell to talk.  The person sitting across from them is the mythical Bishop.  She has the first egg and expects to get the 2nd in 48 hours.  She wants to know the location of the 3rd egg and questions Booth.  He says he doesn't know, but Bishop knows Booth is a liar.  So Bishop leaves.  John tells Booth that if Booth helps him catch Bishop, then Booth will be the #1 thief in the world and John can clear his name.  These strange bedfellows go on a worldwide mission.  But in a world of cons, who can you trust to act like a pro.<br/><br/>Let's be honest.  Within the first 15 minutes of Booth and John on the screen, you know there is more than meets the eye.  With that aside, the comedy and comedic timing is gold.  You will be happy to watch, but once is enough.  With the success of this movie and the ending, be ready for Red Notice 2.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Home Sweet Home Alone",
		"review":"As potential buyers go through their home, Pam and Jeff answer their questions.  While Pam is helpful, Jeff sabotages.  Jeff lost his job months ago and hasn't been able to find work.  They can no longer afford their home.  When Jeff goes upstairs, he sees Maxwell come out of the bathroom.  Maxwell's mom, Carol, pretended to be interested in the home so Maxwell could use the restroom.  Maxwell sees Jeff pull a box of dolls from the closet and annoyingly asks questions. One doll is an ugly little boy with an upside-down head.  Carol, looking for Maxwell, comments that the dolls could be worth a lot of money.  After everyone leaves, Jeff looks up the dolls on eBay.  And the little boy doll is a rare mistake worth $200,000.  Jeff runs to the box, but the doll is missing.  He believes Maxwell stole it.  At Carol's home, there is a lot of commotion because her entire family is there.<br/><br/>However, in the holiday melee, the airline split Carol's family into two flights.  Upset with the crowded house, Maxwell escapes to the garage, gets in a car, and falls asleep watching TV.  In the morning, Jeff comes to Carol's house.  But the family says Carol and Maxwell left.  When the family leaves, Jeff considers breaking in but changes his mind.  Until he looks inside and sees Maxwell's coat with a noticeable bulge; the doll is in Maxwell's coat pocket.  When Jeff tells Pam, she believes he has lost his mind.  But she changes her tune when she thinks about all the Christmases her family spent in that house.  Pam and Jeff go to an empty home to steal back the doll, but they discover someone is still inside.  It's Maxwell.  He overhears Jeff and Pam talking about stealing the ugly little boy and selling him to an old lady.  He assumes they mean him.  With the boy in the house, Pam and Jeff need to devise another plan to get the doll, but Maxwell will be ready for them.<br/><br/>The sixth installment to the Home Alone series changes the script.  The kid is ultimately the bad guy in this story.  The change in dynamic makes you sympathize each time Pam and Jeff get hurt.  They are desperate people trying to save their homes.  Something a lot of people understand.  While it's not the classic, you can use this film to get your kids to watch the first two.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
