		"mtitle":"A Royal Christmas Surprise",
		"review":"Riley and Mandla are successful in their personal and professional lives. Their relationship is more loving than ever because Mandla's parents, King Chidike and Queen Nobantu, accepted Riley as a future wife, princess, and queen. Riley and Mandla decided to throw an engagement party to announce their upcoming nuptials to their friends. Also, they will use the party to introduce Mandla's parents to Riley's relatives, Uncle Ray and Aunt Gina.<br/><br/>Chidike and Nobantu fly to Georgia and travel to Ray and Gina's home. Ray and Chidike greet each other like old friends, but Nobantu and Gina size up each other. Gina remembers how Nobantu made Riley feel in Africa, so she plans to pay Nobantu back. Nobantu won't take Gina's disrespect. She will fight fire with fire while keeping her head held high. They will go for the jugular, and Riley must play peacemaker. Can she keep it up when Mandla drops a bomb on her?<br/><br/>This sequel is a wildly different movie than the first, and that's a good thing. It's funnier, wilder, and has more heart. Don't be surprised if you must pause the TV because you are laughing too hard to hear the dialog. Nobantu and Gina don't pull punches, and their is plenty of collateral damage. Amid this craziness, Mandla keeps a life-altering secret from Riley. You laugh while waiting with bated breath for the other shoe to drop. Viewers will look forward to film three if this series keeps its trajectory.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
