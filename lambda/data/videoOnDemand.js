		"review":"Nicole started singing in her father's church. Today, she is a has-been R and B star with a memorable Christmas song. Nicole performs for a local woman's birthday party but freaks out when they ask her to sing her biggest hit. She refuses to sing and bumps into the birthday woman when she leaves. Nicole returns to her holiday set and finds the crew packing up. The stage director informs Nicole that her check bounced.<br/><br/>Nicole and her manager look over her accounts. They are empty or overdrawn. Nicole realizes her fiancé, Cliff, took the money and ghosted her. Also, someone filmed Nicole knocking down the woman, and it went viral. Nicole's manager suggests Nicole leave LA and visit her hometown. She should film herself doing charitable acts to change the public's perception.<br/><br/>Nicole returns home to an unenthusiastic welcome. The church fell on hard times because the angel investor stopped donating three months ago. Nevertheless, Nicole's mother has an idea. The church won the lottery to host The Christmas Choir Classic. The grand prize is $25,000. Nicole's mother asks Nicole to lead the choir. Can Nicole nab the choir a win without them discovering she is using them for clickbait?<br/><br/>This movie focuses on mending old wounds. The largest one Nicole has to fix is within herself. She doesn't want to sing her trendiest song because it dredges old memories. Today, Nicole sees that avoiding the past doesn't make it go away. This film has some astounding singers and catchy holiday songs.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"A Royal Christmas Surprise",
		"review":"Riley and Mandla are successful in their personal and professional lives. Their relationship is more loving than ever because Mandla's parents, King Chidike and Queen Nobantu, accepted Riley as a future wife, princess, and queen. Riley and Mandla decided to throw an engagement party to announce their upcoming nuptials to their friends. Also, they will use the party to introduce Mandla's parents to Riley's relatives, Uncle Ray and Aunt Gina.<br/><br/>Chidike and Nobantu fly to Georgia and travel to Ray and Gina's home. Ray and Chidike greet each other like old friends, but Nobantu and Gina size up each other. Gina remembers how Nobantu made Riley feel in Africa, so she plans to pay Nobantu back. Nobantu won't take Gina's disrespect. She will fight fire with fire while keeping her head held high. They will go for the jugular, and Riley must play peacemaker. Can she keep it up when Mandla drops a bomb on her?<br/><br/>This sequel is a wildly different movie than the first, and that's a good thing. It's funnier, wilder, and has more heart. Don't be surprised if you must pause the TV because you are laughing too hard to hear the dialog. Nobantu and Gina don't pull punches, and their is plenty of collateral damage. Amid this craziness, Mandla keeps a life-altering secret from Riley. You laugh while waiting with bated breath for the other shoe to drop. Viewers will look forward to film three if this series keeps its trajectory.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
