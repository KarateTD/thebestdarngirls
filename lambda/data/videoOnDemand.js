		"review":"Dr. Sharita finishes her lesson and relaxes in her office. Her watch alarms her because her heart rate is dropping. Before Sharita passes out, she sees a bloody figure coming towards her. Sharita wakes up on the couch with her cousin, Eddie, caring for her. He wants Sharita to get out more and have fun, but she worries about her narcolepsy. She confesses to her doctor that she copes with sleep paralysis and hallucinations, and the doctor suggests increasing her medication dosage.<br/><br/>Preston, going by the rap name P-Mac, walks off stage, and his assistant, Jay, tells P-Mac to stop doing drugs and take his bipolar medication. P-Mac doesn't want to take them because they impede his writing. P-Mac pushes everyone out of his dressing room when his girlfriend, Shontay, requests time alone. She is pregnant and wants to end their relationship because of his abuse. He pretends to agree while slipping drugs into her water. She dies of a drug overdose next to her car.<br/><br/>Sharita talks to her friend, Bryn, about the new neighbor moving next door. Sharita hacks into a database to find information on P-Mac. Later, Sharita strides to P-Mac's home to formally introduce herself. He questions her cameras pointing at his home, and she assures him they are for her condition, not surveillance. He laughs, but something about P-Mac rubs Sharita the wrong way. When she sees him commit a heinous crime, can Sharita trust her eyes, or is it another hallucination?<br/><br/>This movie sets viewers up because both parties struggle with a mental condition. So, the audience is unsure if they can trust what they see. And that makes this plot a pure thriller. Also, the script doesn't take itself too seriously with Eddie's commentary on their dumb actions. And a murder happens while the killer wears a 'good vibes' hoodie. It's comic relief during a brutal scene. This film is for people who aren't horror fans but like a mind-bender.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"First Lady of BMF: The Tonesa Welch Story",
		"review":"Tonesa's mother, Carol, and stepfather, Emerson, agree to watch her son, Little Marlon, while she goes to a club with her friends, Carla and Lisa.

Tonesa dumps her long-distance boyfriend, Big Marlon, for Harvey and moves in with him. One day, Harvey comes home and puts his gun on the table. She confesses that she wants to be a part of his crew and sell drugs. But Harvey says no because he has another plan for her. He wants her to write bad checks.<br/><br/>Tonesa does great scamming for Harvey, but it's not enough. So Harvey teaches her the drug trade, and they expand their territory. They move into a new home, and Tonesa comes up with a new idea. She wants to increase their market to the West because they have money to burn. Harvey ponders her idea and slaps her. Harvey offers Tonesa drugs to dull the pain. Despite her parents' warning, Tonesa willingly slides down a razor's edge into a life of abuse, drugs, money, and jail.<br/><br/>Tonesa matures throughout this film. At first, she blames her parents for holding her back. Then, she accuses her husband and boyfriends. Finally, Tonesa takes a long look at herself. She had something special that made her the first lady of BMF: her tenacity and woman's intuition. Tonesa earns a legitimate living today and works to help other recently released prisoners return to society. The film uses technology, wardrobe, slang, and hair to recreate the period. And it doesn't glamorize her past. It provides an honest look at her decisions, life, consequences, and redemption.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Cameron interrupts his sister's birthday party at the hottest Atlanta club. His sister, Destiny, prepares to argue but stops when Cameron gives her devastating news. The FAA declared their father, Dexter, dead after a plane crash. Cameron and Destiny meet with their stepmother, Corynne, at their father's company, Granite Slate Holdings, in the morning. The corporate attorney, Blake, sits everyone down and briefs them on Dexter's will. Dexter left everything to Corynne, making her the CEO. Corynne cut their salary by 50%, canceled their personal and corporate credit cards, and won't pay for Destiny's apartment. Before they leave, Detective Howard updates the family on the FAA finding. It wasn't a pilot error that caused the plane crash. It was a faulty part. However, the maintenance crew said it was new. The police believe someone tampered with it and classified Dexter's death as a homicide.<br/><br/>Destiny saunters into Cameron's home with bags in tow. Destiny has more on her mind than living arrangements. She wants to take back her father's company. Destiny recalls that Cameron and their stepsister, Lauren, had a fling. They can take over the company and appoint a new CEO with their combined shares. But if Cameron fails, he will give his shares to Destiny. The two shake on their devious plan but keep a dagger behind their backs.<br/><br/>Buy some pearls for this movie because you need something to clutch. The audacity is extreme in this family, and they have zero shame. Their devilish behavior isn't new for them. Their father's death only unleashed the beast. This movie takes a TV series of twists and turns and compacts them into less than 2 hours. The plot has no loose ends but begs for and deserves a part two.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
