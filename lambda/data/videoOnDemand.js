		"mtitle": "The Rip",
		"review": "Lieutenant Dane watches as the FBI interviews members of his Tactical Narcotics Team. Someone murdered their captain, Jackie, the night before. Detective JD gets into a fight with an FBI member as Dane discusses rumors about his team stealing from drug busts with Major Thom. Thom asks Dane to interject, but Dane knows it will be of no use. The FBI agent JD is fighting with is his brother, Del.<br/><br/>TNT members - JD, Mike, Numa, and Lolo - sit outside and joke as the DEA drives their tank in front of police headquarters. DEA Agent Mateo asks if they have a lead on Jackie's slaying. Sadly, they don't. As they rib Mateo, Dane sits inside and gets a text from an unknown number. It has a stash house address with large sums of money inside.<br/><br/>Dane rushes outside to alert the crew. He tells JD that the house has $300K inside and convinces him to go. JD doesn't hide his excitement. Dane sees Numa on her motorcycle and informs her the rip is $250,000. Next, he lets Mike know he can join in on the rip for $150,000. And tells Lolo $75,000. They grab a consent to search form and a money sniffing dog, Wilbur.<br/><br/>The team arrives at the home and notices the street is empty. They knock on the door, and Desi answers. They convince her sign the form and barge inside. Wilbur alerts to a scuttle in the ceiling. They pull down the stairs and notice its remarkable condition compared to the rest of the house. They open the wall and find buckets of money. They estimate that it's over a million dollars. JD wants to follow the procedure: count the money and turn it in. However, Dane has other plans. JD fears that Dane is compromised and they are all in danger. Has the rip gone wrong?<br/><br/>Inspired by actual stories, this action mystery film has a well-written plot that captures your full attention the moment Dane gives everyone a different number. The script allowed every character to tell a lie and question their moral compass. The sound quality isn't great during calls or arguments, but it doesn't distract from the plot. The final shoot-out falls flat in comparison to the start's well-written whodunit. While this movie is intriguing and fast-paced, it's a standard mystery and cop drama. You will watch this movie once, like it, but won't have a need to rewatch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "A Soulful Christmas",
		"review": "Macon's Hall of Fame will honor its most famous singing duo, Patty and Ashford. They are known for their hit holiday tune, Love at Christmas Time. The duo had a falling out years ago and hasn't created any new music since. Neither wants to attend the induction ceremony.<br/><br/>Patty calls her daughter Winnie. Winnie made an album years ago, but everyone compared her to her famous mother. Winnie tries to convince Patty to attend the ceremony, but Patty refuses, as she doesn't want to see Ashford again. She asks Winnie to go in her place.<br/><br/>Financer Robert discusses his latest business venture with Thurman. Their client won't work with them without proof of liquidity. Thurman urges Robert to call his famous father, Ashford, for the money, but Robert won't. Robert receives a call from his sister, Bailey. Bailey plans to attend the ceremony and asks Robert to appear and represent their dad. He agrees.<br/><br/>Robert and Bailey await Winnie at a café. They attend the ceremony and honor their parents in front of disappointed fans. Afterward, Gene, the CEO of a record label, approaches Winnie and asks her to re-record her mother's hit song. She says no. Then, Gene asks Robert. Robert starts to reject the offer until Gene mentions the 400,000 dollar advance. However, the song must be ready by Christmas. And Gene believes the new song will be better as a duo.<br/><br/>Later, Robert convinces Winnie to join him in remaking their parents' song. Winnie wants creative control, and Robert is uncomfortable singing. Winnie has to help him gain the confidence to sing while he helps her heal past wounds. Can they come together and remake their parents' love song while falling in love with each other?<br/><br/>This film has classic holiday romance clichés and a catchy song. Once you understand the plot's setup, nothing else will grab your attention except the saucy grandma, Leah. She is a spitfire who provides the much-needed comic relief for the film. While they have notable names in music to guest star, their star power isn't enough to capture your attention. Viewers should play this film in the background while taking down their tree.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Vera's Holiday Flop",
		"review": "Vera discusses her holiday plans with her neighbor, Rhonda, over the phone. It's been years since Vera and her friends have been together, and she has a list of activities for them. This time is special because Vera has a secret. In anticipation of a promotion, Vera sold her home and paid for a place in China. She's ready to start her life fresh.<br/><br/>Kelsie arrives with her girlfriend, influencer Shayla. Stunned, Vera has never seen Kelsie with a woman before. Kayden and his wife, Tori, arrive first. They lovingly argue about big and small things. Ajuni arrives on a bike, leaving a trail of funk behind him. Athlete Delvin arrives with a camera crew in tow. The group wonders where Morgan is currently. Vera hopes she's on the way but assumes Morgan stopped at church first. Their friend, Barry, is still in jail, and Vera's old crush, Omar, hasn't responded. They are finally together and ready to have a good time. But as old rivalries and problems rise to the surface, will this group's friendship implode?<br/><br/>Vera's friends are an eclectic and wild bunch. The audience will wonder how they became friends. The writer made Vera the group's lynchpin and ensured these conflicts had a deeper issue. The characters weren't yelling to be right. However, they open old wounds and heal them. This group seems silly, but they handle their problems maturely and openly. They don't leave things unsaid or run out of the room. They are upfront and honest. It's refreshing to see in a holiday film. This film offers a lot of laughs and room for growth.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery",
		"review": "Detective Benoit Blanc ignites a fire before sitting to read a letter written by Reverend Jud Duplenticy. Months earlier, Bishop Langstrom reassigned Jud to Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude after Jud punched another rude Reverend. Langstrom informed Jud that Monsignor Jefferson Wicks runs the church, but his parish is aging and small.<br/><br/>The parish has a few faithful followers. Martha handles every administrative task at the church. She grew up under the tutelage of Wicks's grandfather, Reverend Prentice. Martha's devotee and lover is the groundskeeper, Samson. Samson and Jefferson stopped drinking together, and living on the property keeps them accountable.<br/><br/>Doctor Nathaniel Sharp used to come to the church with his wife, Darla, every Sunday, until she left him. Now, he prays she returns while taking care of the townspeople, including Jefferson. Attorney Vera Draven took over her father's practice and place in the church after he died. She is still a dutiful daughter and handles the church's legal matters. When her father came home with a young boy, Cy, he told Vera to raise him as her own. Everyone assumes he's Mr. Draven's illegitimate child, but no one speaks of it. Cy returned home after losing a political bid. Now, he uploads Jefferson's sermons on YouTube.<br/><br/>Best-selling author Lee Ross's sales have been declining steadily. He wants to write a book about Jefferson and follows him around to collect details. Cellist Simone Vivane hasn't been able to play after a terrible accident left her with constant pain. She will pay to get a cure.<br/><br/>During the Good Friday service, Jefferson was in full form. He needed a break to fortify himself, so he went into the storage closet beside the pulpit as Jud prayed over the flock. Soon, everyone heard a thud from the closet. Jud ran inside and found Jefferson bleeding with a devil-shaped object protruding from his back. Dr. Nathaniel tells Jud not to touch the body. He runs inside, examines the body, declares Jefferson's death, and pulls the knife from his body. Police Chief Geraldine investigates the crime. She doesn't know how a man can enter a closet alone and be a murder victim. Will Benoit Blanc be able to solve it?<br/><br/>This standalone third film rivals the first. It has a compelling set of characters with rich backstories and an intriguing victim. Unlike the past, the plot doesn't revolve around Benoit. Also, the lighting and set design matched Jud's mood. It pulls you into the mystery without overpowering it. The director made a memorable choice when Jud lifted his bloody hand to the screen. It's a call back to so many movies we know and love. The 'why' and 'how' drive the story, but you will figure out 'who.' But their crime is so juicy, you won't care. Don't miss this latest Knives Out mystery.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Never Alone for Christmas: Memphis",
		"review": "Monica promotes her dating app and matchmaking business on Morning Memphis, co-hosted by her fiancé, Pierre. During the show, Monica alerts the audience that December 11th is the day most couples break up, warning them not to fall victim and end up spending Christmas alone. After this, Pierre announces that he and Monica will get married during the show's Christmas Eve taping. Later, at a café, Pierre tells Monica he wants a more traditional marriage to symbolize their success and expects her to end her business once they marry. Monica refuses and returns the ring.<br/><br/>The next day on the show, Pierre tells the audience that the wedding is off and that Monica broke up with him on December 11th. He cries for the cameras, leading Monica to lose all her clients. Soon after, Monica gets a call from Joe, who asks for her matchmaking services. She tells him the business is closed and hangs up. Later, after reflecting on Pierre's harsh words to viewers to 'not be a loser,' Monica reconsiders and calls Joe back to arrange an appointment.<br/><br/>Monica sits in the corner as Joe trips into the room. He has zero confidence, is clumsy, and has no social skills. However, he loves Christmas, working for charities, and his church. He wants to have a date for his office Christmas party. Monica promises to help him find the right woman. She assists him with his self-esteem, attire, and presence, but is she creating the perfect man for herself?<br/><br/>This standalone sequel allows the love to grow organically. Viewers will have sympathy for Joe. He means well. But his exterior doesn't match his heart. The script properly balances the holiday with comedy, love, and fellowship. They handle faith without alienating others. And add the right touch of hope for the viewers. You will watch this film with a smile on your face and joy in your heart. And let's not forget an original song from K. Michelle to ring in the holiday cheer.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
