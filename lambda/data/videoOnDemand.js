		"review":"Poppy is enjoying her reign as a queen with dignity and song.  Branch still lives in his bunker.  He has fallen in love with Poppy and doesn’t know how to tell her.  As the trolls celebrate the birth of Tiny Diamond, Poppy gets a letter from a rock star.  Queen Barb of the Rock Trolls plans to come to Pop Village and create one nation under Rock.  King Peppy reveals the Troll’s history to Poppy.  Many years ago, there were six strings that played different types of music: Pop, Country, Classical, Rock, Techno, and Funk.  Over time, they became intolerant of each other’s music and started to fight.  Each troll musical faction took their string and left.  Poppy refuses to run and wants to protect her kingdom.  She fires up a hot air balloon to find Queen Barb and the other factions.  Then, have a party to unite all the trolls with her pop sound.  Branch sees it differently.  He believes that Queen Barb is ready for a fight and prepares to fight back. So, he reluctantly joins Poppy.  Meanwhile, Queen Barb has gotten Poppy’s reply of friendship and she is disgusted.  She wants to unite the strings to make all the trolls Rock Zombies by playing the Ultimate Power Chord.  When every troll is the same, no one will fight.  As both Queens start their mission, they will learn the beauty of individuality, respect, and how history is written.<br/><br/>Based on Good Luck Trolls and the sequel to Trolls, this rainbow blast includes music for all ages and genres like Dee-Lite, Cyndi Lauper, Beethoven, Spice Girls, George Clinton, Baha Men, PSY, Chic, Scorpions, Daft Punk, and more.  Unlike other movies that teach children togetherness, it praises individuality through a groove, a riff, or a yodel.  With this storyline, you get 2 subplots.  The first subplot, Branch is finding a way to express his love for Poppy.  The second subplot, Cooper is finding his real family and music faction.  As a strong spectacle of entertainment, it surpasses the first movie and leaves you wanting more movies in the future.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Autumn sings He’s Got The Power at the school talent show when someone screams vulgar comments at her.  Autumn has more than a song on her mind.  She skips school to get a pregnancy test at the women’s clinic.  While the doctor warns her of false-negative results, Autumn’s test is positive.  Her next appointment reveals she is 10-weeks pregnant.  Her reaction to the news concerns the receptionist.  The receptionist asks her about adoption and Autumn doesn’t see that as an option.  Then, the receptionist asks Autumn if she is abortion-minded.  When Autumn’s silence says yes, the receptionist plays her a pro-life video.  She goes home and starts looking up alternatives online.  Autumn doesn’t want her parents to know about the pregnancy so she tries to cause a miscarriage.  Nothing works.  She goes to work and her cousin Skylar sees she is sick.  She finally admits she is pregnant.  Skylar steals money from work and the cousins go to New York for Autumn's abortion.<br/><br/>At first, it’s hard to believe these to girls can go across state lines without their parents noticing.  When you discover they are being sexually harassed, verbally tormented, and sexually active, it’s easy to see the abject neglect they have lived through.  Also, you and Autumn have no idea of the pain she has suffered until she answers those hard-hitting questions for the first time.  As Autumn goes through the physical and emotional pain of this journey, it’s Skylar that develops psychological scars when they run out of money.  This movie does not glorify abortion, it gives an honest account of what someone goes through when they have to get one.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
