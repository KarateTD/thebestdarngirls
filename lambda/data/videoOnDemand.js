This plot follows the formula for post-apocalyptic dramas but uses looks as its focus. Making yourself beautiful appeals to a younger audience raised in a world of filters. However, they don't see what they sacrifice over time. This film takes it to the extreme, but the message resonates. Aside from the message, the graphics are mesmerizing. It brings the audience into this new world. Parents can use this movie to open a dialog with their teens.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
