		"review": "Overly cautious, Alexander is known for his bad luck, so much so that his sister, Mia, walks 10 steps before Alexander whenever they go anywhere. Mia, on her phone, backs into a fire hydrant. When their mother, Val, returns home, Mia blames Alexander's luck. Their father, Frank, enters the driveway while talking to his manager, Brett. Frank's cooking got a bad review from an important writer. So, Brett will close the restaurant. When Val asks Frank about the restaurant's foot traffic, he says everything is fine.<br/><br/>While Frank's mother, Lidia, cooks, Val gives them some good news. Her job rented an RV for the family. Now, they can go on a family vacation to Soledad, Mexico, and she can document the trip for the magazine.<br/><br/>Before dinner, Alexander goes into the attic. He finds a chest belonging to great, great grandfather Alejandro with an idol inside. Alexander questions his family about the artifact at dinner. His grandfather, Gilbert, explains that three witch sisters gave the idol to Alejandro for good luck. However, they instructed Alejandro to return it when he had enough, or his luck would turn. Alejandro became wealthy and refused to return the artifact. A disease took over his crops, and Alejandro burned them. The fire spread and devastated Soledad. Now, Alexander thinks he possesses Alejandro's luck. Frank grabs the idol and throws it in the trash.<br/><br/>The family boards the RV for their trip while leaving Gilbert behind to watch the dog. Val crashes the RV after a series of unfortunate accidents. They stop at a bot√°nica to figure out what to do next. Alexander and Mia wait outside while the others shop. Alexander bumps into the cooler, and the idol tumbles out. He wants to return to Soledad and give the witches the idol to break the family's curse. Mia and Alexander say they want to learn about their heritage and convince their mother to rent an RV for the remainder of the vacation. This road trip will go from no good to terrible. Will the Garcia family survive intact, or will the curse strike again?<br/><br/>Inspired by Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst, the start allows viewers to connect with Alexander's loving family. The script offers laughs as the Garcias travel from Colorado to Mexico. The director offers practical graphics for fantastical events. This setup allows the audience to enjoy the scenes without worrying about the family's safety. Gil and Lidia offer two perspectives on the Garcia family heritage. These conflicting views will draw viewers' attention while making them laugh, no matter their background. The movie is for the tween and teen audience. It's not the best of Disney+, but this standalone sequel is clean entertainment without forcing specific views.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Tyler Perry's Duplicity",
		"review": "Attorney Marley exercises with her friend, journalist Fela, at a spin gym with Marley's boyfriend, private investigator Tony. Marley catches up to Fela in the parking lot and asks Fela to join them for breakfast with Fela's husband, Rodney. Fela agrees if Marley's friend, Officer Kevin, doesn't come.<br/><br/>Tony and Rodney arrive at breakfast first. Tony and Rodney hide their issues from their partners. Fela and Marley join them. The couples eat and go to their prospective jobs while Rodney goes for a morning run.<br/><br/>Kevin briefs officers in the morning about crime statistics. He grabs rookie Officer Caleb to shadow him. Then, Kevin reiterates when a cop says gun, you shoot.<br/><br/>Rodney puts his phone in his pocket and his headphones on his head. Someone calls Deloris and warns her that a black man is running in her alley after robbing her neighbor. Deloris calls the police.<br/><br/>Rodney turns around the corner, and two officers, Kevin and Caleb, point their guns at him. Kevin screams gun, and Caleb shoots. As the police rush Rodney to the hospital, Fela sits at the anchor desk and reports breaking news. Her producers pull Fela off the air, and she runs to the hospital. Unfortunately, Rodney dies from his wounds. Marley can't contain her rage and promises to make the city pay for killing Rodney. However, the more Marley digs, she becomes unsure of what happened. Was it another racially motivated police shooting or a murder-by-cop?<br/><br/>This thriller takes a hot-button topic and turns it on its head. Marley's quest starts with a political fight to make the city pay for racial wrongdoings. Then, she stumbles into the seedy truth. Marly stops blindly following the narrative and unpacks the cause. With the preaching aside, this movie gives the audience a few good twists with incredible performances from a note-worthy cast. This film is one of Tyler's better dramatic movies since Acrimony.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Fighting to Be Me: The Dwen Curry Story",

This story will open your heart to understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. You will love how this Trap Queen overcame and looked fabulous doing it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Sugar Baby",

Then, she gets a job waiting tables at a high-end restaurant. Jade confides to her manager, Angel, that her life is falling apart. Then, Jade sees a group of well-dressed women at the bar. Angel explains that the women are sugar babies. Later, Jade gets a call from G-Ro. He's disappointed in her low-paying job. He tells her to strip to make fast money.

A man verbally and physically harasses Jade when Anthony intervenes. Jade admits that she doesn't enjoy feeling like property. HLater, Anthony comes to Jade's job and asks her on a proper date. She agrees. Angel is excited because Anthony is a big fish for a sugar baby. As the relationship progresses, Angel reminds Jade that the relationship is transactional. However, she can't keep her feelings out of the equation. Will things change when G-Ro gets out of jail?<br/><br/>This movie is sexy, thought-provoking, and drama-filled. While the film gives a romanticized view of the sugar lifestyle, it warns the viewers of the pitfalls. Jade's main flaw didn't get settled in the film. She never had a plan and relied solely on others. The clothing and sets are perfect. And the dialog sets the scene. This movie grabs your attention but should be used as an instruction manual. It's a warning.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy",
		"review": "Today marks the 4th anniversary of Mr. Darcy's death. Bridget calls Daniel to look after her children - Billy and Mabel - so she can commiserate with friends. They offer lots of advice, but nothing helps Bridget. She reflects on her time with her dad, Colin, and remembers he told her to live. She opens her diary and starts to write again. She will date and rejoin the workforce.<br/><br/>Bridget drops her children off at school and applauds a teacher standing up to the 'perfect mom.' Bridget discovers the teacher is Mr. Wallaker. He teaches Billy's science class and directs the school choir. She doesn't deny that he's attractive but considers him off-limits.<br/><br/>Bridget takes her kids to the park. As she contemplates life, she hears her kids yelling because they are stuck in a tree. Bridget climbs the tree, but fear pins her to the branches. A park employee, Roxster, comes to assist. After Roxster saves the Darcy family, Bridget and Roxster text constantly. Bridget adores their current relationship until Roxster wants to meet in person. He is much younger than her. As time progresses, Bridget wonders if this relationship is the best for her and her family. Should she hold out for something more, or was Mark her one true love?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding, this movie respects its core audience with callbacks to the previous three films. The film's synopsis is misleading. Bridget isn't choosing between Roxster and Mr. Wallaker. She chooses between doing what's fun versus doing what's admirable. While this script moves you, it's not as funny as its predecessors. And several moments feel like the end, but it's not. These false endings make the picture feel longer and cause it to drag. This movie is purely for the core fans and won't gain new ones.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
