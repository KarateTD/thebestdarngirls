		"review":"Emma returns home from a work trip and realizes she forgot her anniversary. She profusely apologizes to her husband, Dave. That night, he gives Emma a gift box but tries to hide it before she sees it. She opens it and finds a sexy nurse costume. To his surprise, Emma likes the idea of role-playing but wants to take it a step further. She wants to dress up, go to a hotel bar, and pretend to be strangers.<br/><br/>Emma makes it to the bar first, but Dave is in traffic. Bob approaches Emma at the bar and attempts to flirt with her. Bob notices Emma eyeing Dave and gives them room. Then, Bob interrupts them again. Dave and Emma manage to escape Bob and saunter to their room. Emma excuses herself to the bathroom and watches a timer. After a few minutes, she finds Dave asleep on the bed. She changes clothes, puts her hair in a ponytail, and walks to Bob's room. Bob can't believe he found one of the most wanted assassins by chance. Emma kills Bob and returns to Dave.<br/><br/>Emma tells Dave she has another work trip and has to leave. However, Dave is upset because the news reports about Bob's death and has images of them with Bob. Emma tells Dave to relax. She promises to handle everything when she returns. Days later, Dave arrives at the airport to meet Emma, but she isn't there. Dave leaves in a panic, and two officers approach him. They question him about Bob, Emma, and her travels. Agent Gwen enters with startling information. Emma is a contract killer with dozens of confirmed hits around the world.<br/><br/>Dave returns home and looks through Emma's things. He combs through the business cards and calls the numbers. Emma picks up and tells Dave to run and take the kids. Gwen is hunting Emma. Dave refuses to run and wants to join Emma in Berlin to help. Emma begs him not to, but he hangs up and books his flight. Dave and Emma's night of role-play becomes a dangerous game of mom vs. mom.<br/><br/>This movie has intense action with well-balanced comedic timing. However, the script needed more time to develop Emma's backstory. The plot uses it as the big reveal, but the characters utter it so fast that you may miss it. People try to convince Dave that Emma is a killer incapable of love. Despite the evidence, he refuses to believe them. After everything ends, Emma and Dave are an everyday couple with two kids. This movie is perfect for an escape and is worth a free prime trial.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
