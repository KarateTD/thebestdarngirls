		"review":"Veteran Dan Forester works as a high school biology teacher, but he wants to work in a research lab.  He adores his wife, Emmy, and daughter, Muri, but he doesn't talk to his estranged father, James.  After another rejection from a research company, Dan tries to enjoy a world cup match with his family and friends at a holiday party.  During the game, a large electrical storm forms, and soldiers appear on the soccer field.  The leader tells the soccer attendees and the millions watching at home that they are from 30 years in the future.  They are at war with a non-human enemy, and in 11-months, humankind will perish.  They need help from people today to fight in the future.  Within 12 months, the world leaders create a global draft, and if you try to escape, a member of your family will take your place. During class, Dan gets an alert that the government is drafting him. Dan knows James used his engineering skills to help people take off the band without alerting the government.  At first, Dan goes to James, but after an argument, Dan decides to go to war. They explain that they call the enemy White Spikes, and if the soldiers are still alive in seven days, they will bring them back.  Dan's fight in the future will bring in face to face with the person he never wanted to be: his father.  He will fight The Tomorrow War and heal his family today.<br/><br/>This movie has elements of Independence Day and Back to the Future, but it is an original concept.  And within the plot, they set themselves apart from these movies. They can only jump seven years from now because time moves forward.  This random explanation elevates the plot beyond other sci-fi movies.  And the detailed graphics will make you wish you had a larger screen. It does contain violence, so it's up to the parent to determine if their child should watch.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney and Pixar's Luca",
		"review":"Luca is a sea monster that works as a fish herder on his parents' farm.  He hears things about land monsters but never traveled to the surface.  While herding fish, Luca finds a clock and other human items.  Then he hears a voice in the distance claiming the stuff.  The voice belongs to Alberto, another teenage sea monster.  Alberto grabs his stuff, swims to the surface, and changes to human form. Luca goes home to ask his parents, Daniela and Lorenzo, about the surface.  Daniela stops Luca and tells him it's too dangerous.  The next day, Luca finds Alberto and follows him to the surface. Alberto introduces himself, and they go to Alberto's hideout. Luca looks around the room and sees a picture of a Vespa.  This piece of machinery transfixes Luca. Four hours later, Luca and Alberto complete their makeshift Vespa and take it for a joy ride.  After crashing, Luca notices the time and runs home. His parents know he has been to the surface and decides to punish him. Luca runs away to the surface.  On land, Luca finds Alberto, and they head into town.  Then, they spot a Vespa owned by Ercole, the local bully.  He tells them he bought the Vespa after winning the Portorosso Triathlon Cup Race five times in a row.  Then, Ercole tries to push Luca's face into a fountain, but Giulia stops Ercole. She grabs Luca and Alberto and takes them to safety.  Luca and Alberto want to enter the contest and win the prize money to buy a Vespa. So, they ask Giulia to join their team.  But she says no.  When they remind her that she got sick doing it alone, she joins them. But Luca doesn't know his parents came to the surface looking for him and vow to bring him home.<br/><br/>Pixar's animation of a small Italian village looks so real that it will take your breath away at first glance. While the animation is second to none, the storyline doesn't completely engross you into the movie like Pixar's other films. But your children will love the characters and animated transformation from a sea monster to a land monster and back again.  Putting the film on Disney+ was the best choice for viewers.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

Finn, this movie can lead you down the rabbit hole if you don't know the clues to look and listen for while viewing.  This movie does a compelling job of keeping you guessing about each of the characters. While it does get your attention, there are moments the film will lose you.  Whether it's pointless dialogue or lackluster characters, your mind will wander.  Unlike Knives Out, this movie will not make you want to rewatch it for unseen clues.  One watch is enough to entertain and move on.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Zack Snyder's Justice League",
		"review":"After the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne, known as Batman, can't forget the warning Lex Luther gave him.  Lex warned something big is coming that will destroy all humankind.  So, Batman does the one thing he never thought he would do: team-up.  First, Bruce went to a small fishing village to find the sea protector, Arthur Curry.  Arthur, better known as Aquaman, gives Bruce a few choice words then disappears.  Diana overhears that the Shrine of the Amazons is on fire, and she knows it's a signal from her mother, the Queen of the Amazons.  She goes to the shrine, opens a cave, and reads the writings on the wall. In the past, man, Amazons, Atlanteans, Gods, and protectors of the stars got together to fight Darkseid and won.  After the battle, Darkseid left 3 Mother Boxes behind. For years, the boxes slept.  However, the Amazon's box awakens, and Steppenwolf followed the call.  He stole the first box from them, and he is on the hunt for the other two.  If he gets them and performs The Unity, the veil between Earth and Darkseid will fall. Bruce tells Diana that Arthur said no, so they decide to split up, go after the other two metahumans, and convince them to join the team.  Soon, they will realize that they need one more member, Superman.  His life kept Darkseid at bay and the Mother Boxes asleep, but they will have to find a way to bring him back to defeat the dark forces to come.  Lois is the key.<br/><br/>After fans demanded this version, they got four hours of what they wanted. Yes!!! This movie is four hours long with six parts and an epilogue.  Each part adds something new to the characters that we haven't seen before. Also, the plot gives us the origin story of the Mother Boxes, Steppenwolf, and the ultimate weapon.  With more time, the CGI team fixed some of the horrible graphics in the first film. And within this retelling, the writers give an alternate ending that feels like a love letter to the fans.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Coming 2 America",
		"review":"It's been 30 years since Prince Akeem went to America and defied his father and tradition to find true love with his Princess, Lisa.  Now, Akeem and Lisa have three daughters: Meeka, Omma, and Tinashe.  While Akeem loves his daughters, his father, King Jaffe, reminds him only a male can be heir to the throne.  General Izzi of Nextdoria is furious with Akeem because Akeem didn't marry his sister Imani. Izzi wants Meeka to marry his son to restore the bond between the two countries. Before Akeem can speak, King Jaffe calls Akeem to his sickbed.  A shaman saw a vision of Akeem's first-born, only son living in Queens. Jaffe tells Akeem to go to Queens and get his son.  Then have his son marry Izzi's only daughter, Bopoto.  Their family would still rule Zamunda, and Nextdoria's tradelines will open.  Semmi and Akeem travel to Queens and notice the changes to the neighborhood instantly.  They go to the local barbershop and show the shaman's drawing of Akeem's son, and the shop owners recognize the boy as Lavelle Junson and give Lavelle's location. After talking to Lavelle, Lavelle brings Akeem and Semmi to meet his family, including his mother, Mary. Lavelle doesn't want to go to Zamunda until he sees the gold bricks Semmi possesses.  Lavelle agrees to go, but only if Mary can go too.  Lavelle can't wait to be a prince.  But when this prince feels like a diplomatic pawn, will he fall in line or blaze his father's path?<br/><br/>The sequel to Coming to America has the laughs and lessons from the first movie.  A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
