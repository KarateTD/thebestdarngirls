Then, Red storms onto your screen with a song that will immerse you into the dark world of Wonderland. Chloe lives in King Charming's kingdom with rewards for goodness. Chloe, seeing Cinderella's teen angst and coldness, throws Chloe for a loop. While the storyline and the songs are flawless, you will want more to the story. The previous films had a twist. But this one film doesn't. This installment brings joy, songs, and lessons like its predecessors but feels half-done without the twist.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Turtles All The Way Down",
		"review": "Aza's therapist considers several forms of therapy after Aza admits to opening her callus again. Aza confesses to taking her medication sporadically but won't consider Exposure Response Therapy for her Contamination OCD. Aza eats lunch with her best friend, Daisy, at school but runs out of the cafeteria because she thinks her stomach is too loud. Aza furiously washes her hands, removes her band-aid, opens her callus, and puts soap into the wound. Her thoughts ease. Daisy plans to meet Aza after school at the most posh restaurant in town: Applebee's.<br/><br/>As they eat their burgers, Aza and Daisy overhear a news report about Russell Davis Pickett. Russell is a fugitive billionaire with several white-collar crimes to his name. He left his two sons, Davis and Noah, behind. The police issued a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Daisy remembers that Aza met Davis at a camp for children coping with loss. Aza remembers Davis got a web camera for his 13th birthday. They put it in a tree on his property. Daisy wants to sync to it and examine the photos for evidence.<br/><br/>Aza and Daisy find the camera and sync with it. However, a groundskeeper discovers them and brings them to the Pickett's home. Davis remembers Aza, and Daisy observes he's smitten. Daisy wants Aza to keep up the conversation with Davis. They can return to the belly of the beast, investigate Russell's disappearance, and receive the reward money. However, Aza worries about becoming close to Davis and potentially having his microbiome inside her. Can Daisy and Aza find Russell without Aza spiraling?<br/><br/>Based on the novel Turtles All The Way Down by John Green, this adaptation draws you into Aza's spiral while keeping her human. The script doesn't depict Aza as all-knowing or perfect. She has flaws, and her OCD impacts everyone around her. Later, Daisy's fan fiction feels harsh. But when Daisy questions Aza about her personal life, Aza flounders. It's a complex and necessary conversation for these friends and exposes the faults in their friendship. Also, viewers get a mystery. This film ends like most of John Green's books, with an honest, compelling, hopeful, and wholehearted conclusion. It will leave a mark and conversation for the audience.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
