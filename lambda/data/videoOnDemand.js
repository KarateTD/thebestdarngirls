		"review": "Dawn questions her family about the mail after finding the mailbox empty. Her sisters, Max and Emily, didn't check it. Then, Dawn sees her grandmother's grin. Birdie hands Dawn a letter from a Parisian art school. Dawn got an acceptance letter from her dream school, but she didn't receive financial aid. Birdie rejoices because Dawn has a Paris fund. Dawn feigns a grin and leaves to sit in her truck alone. Max finds Dawn and asks what's wrong. Dawn used her Paris fund to cover Birdie's medical bills after she fell last year.<br/><br/>Max enters Dawn's workplace with an idea. Max's favorite show, The Honeypot, will host its 16th season in Paris. The show's premise is that an eligible bachelor meets 20 single women. At the conclusion, he will propose. However, the remaining woman has to choose the honey or the money. Dawn could fly to Paris for the show, lose the first round, and stay. She can use the appearance fee for school. Dawn agrees to her sister's plan.<br/><br/>Max and Dawn play pool while Trey watches Dawn at the bar. She walks over to get some more beverages and flirts with Trey. She assumes he's a city slicker, cosplaying as a cowboy. She dances with Trey regardless.<br/><br/>Max coaches Dawn to impress the show's producers, Rachel and Carl. Rachel likes Dawn's small-town vibe. Carl sends Dawn a contract, and she joins the other contestants. They board the plane for Paris and relax. Dawn notices that someone has blacked out the windows. A contestant explains that the producers want to catch their pure reaction when they exit the aircraft.<br/><br/>They exit the plane and learn they are in Paris, TX. Dawn wants to leave now. Rachel reminds Dawn of her contract. As the women fight over swag, Dawn walks to the stables to admire the horse. She finds Trey there and discovers he is the Honeypot. She pleads with Trey to eliminate her first. However, Trey picks her last. He's smitten with her and thinks time will change her mind. Will Dawn choose Paris or The Honeypot?<br/><br/>This film returns comedy to the rom-com genre. It intelligently uses the absurdity of reality television as its backdrop, including the season-opening twists. Unlike most small-town leads, Dawn isn't running away from her life. Trey is a Renaissance man. Cynics will groan and assume they know the ending, but don't give up on this film. The ending is unique, funny, and charming. It offers the romance you want in the 21st century. This picture found a proper home with Netflix.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Peripheral",
		"review": "Photographer Sasha wakes next to her husband, biochemist Ramone, during their drive to their new company-provided home. Ramone's new company, Black Lotus, offered them a fully furnished house in the town of Heartfelt. Then, Nina, Ramone's handler, enters the home. She's there to handle any needs outside of the community, like food, contracts, or scheduling conflicts. They have dinner and prepare for bed. Ramone stirs at 3 a.m. because Black Lotus wants him at work for orientation. When Ramone returns in the evening, he's cold and distant.<br/><br/>Over the next few days, Ramone comes home later and later. Then, he doesn't return at all. Sasha calls Nina for assistance, but Nina ignores her cries for help. Days later, Detectives arrive at Sasha's door. They received a letter from Black Lotus, stating that Ramone never came to work.<br/><br/>Sasha hears a knock at the door. It's the Detectives. They found Ramone covered in someone else's blood. Sasha deeply embraces her husband and bathes him in the shower. They make passionate love, and she's in bliss. But that's short-lived. Sasha will discover that there is something wrong with Ramone, her neighbors, and the town. Can she escape now that she's pregnant?<br/><br/>You can only describe this psychological thriller as weird. You are unsure of anyone's status at the conclusion. It's left to the audience to decide. This film has a few jump scares, but teeters on something more, like Mother! Viewers will wonder why Sasha doesn't leave the town. It's not until later that you learn that she is reeling from a miscarriage. The film should come with a trigger warning because the miscarriage scene is graphic. The other effects are practical but effective. The climax follows the thriller arc, but the disappointing conclusion ends like an independent film. Well, at least you get a hammer to the head twice.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "The Pickup",
		"review": "Armored truck driver Travis picks up cash from the First National Bank when a gorgeous woman asks him for a pen. Travis stammers at the woman's beauty before handing it to her. She hands him a note and tells him to read it. Travis assumes it's a robbery and pulls out a gun. She begs him to read it. It's her phone number. Travis apologizes. She accepts it with a weekend in her hotel room. He wakes up late Monday morning and hurries to work.<br/><br/>Russ gives his wife, Natalie, a kiss before going to work. He will be home tonight to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary with a lovely dinner. Russ arrives at work, and his boss, Clark, assigns him the longest route with the new guy. Annoyed, Russ demands that Travis get in the car and drive.<br/><br/>Zoe meets with Miguel and Banner. She did recon and created a plan to steal $60 million. They will attack the armor truck in a dead zone and force it to pull over. Then, they will steal it and the money inside. If everything goes well, they will have $20 million and a flight to Bali.<br/><br/>Travis and Russ finish several pickups and drive down a long stretch of highway. Then, an SUV appears in front of them. A passenger climbs out of the sunroof and holds a sign that reads, 'Pull over and you won't get hurt.' After a fiery car chase, a robber stands in the back of their truck with a gun. Then the thief pulls off their mask. It's the woman Travis spent the weekend with, Zoe. Travis keeps quiet about their previous rendezvous. She takes their phone and makes them drive to an abandoned shed.<br/><br/>The high-speed chase has eliminated Miguel and Banner. So, she demands that Travis and Russ take their place. If not, she will kill Natalie. Russ doesn't understand because the truck doesn't have more than $300,000 inside. Stealing the armored truck was the first step in her plan. However, she doesn't know that Miguel and Banner are alive. They discovered she left them behind, and now they are out for revenge. Zoe is holding Travis and Russ hostage while Banner and Miguel are hot on their trail. Will Russ and Travis make it out alive?<br/><br/>The heist story is nothing new. With its predictable ending, it's the established characters that entertain you. Within the first 15 minutes, you have an understanding of who Russ and Travis are. The script waits to tell Zoe's backstory. It softens her character and makes you sympathize with her. The three are comedy gold and ad-libbed some scenes. The first chase scene is exciting and hysterical. The stunt work is fun and well-done on the film's budget. Prime Video is the right platform for this movie. It's not for the whole family, but older teens will enjoy it.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "My Oxford Year",
		"review": "Anna chose to start her job at Goldman Sachs late so she could attend the University of Oxford for a year to study poetry. She has a list of things she wants to do around the city and doesn't want to waste a moment. A sports car hits a puddle and drenches her with rainwater. She finds a local restaurant and orders fish and chips. She sits quietly and reads a book when Jamie comes in with his friend, Cecelia. After they order, Jamie hides. Cecelia looks across the street and spots Jessica, Jamie's latest conquest. Anna laughs until she sees his car. It's the same car that splashed her. Anna leaves the restaurant, calls Jessica's name, and alerts her to Jamie's location.<br/><br/>Anna bounces in her seat on the first day of class. Anna has dreamed about meeting her hero, Professor Styan. Professor Styan enters the room with stellar news. She got the job of a lifetime and wants to start now. She will leave her teaching duties in the hands of her best student, Jamie. Jamie and Anna lock eyes and remember how they met. They verbally spar in the class over cake and poetry.<br/><br/>Anna and Jamie spend time together, and he challenges her view on life and poetry. One day, Cecelia approaches Anna with a warning: Loving Jamie will lead to heartbreak and destruction. Anna considers Cecelia a jilted ex-lover. Besides, her relationship with Jamie is just for fun. When he doesn't show up for a friendly outing, Anna runs to Jamie's home to yell at him. She finds him with Cecelia and a dark secret that will change the direction of her life forever.<br/><br/>Based on My Oxford Year by Julia Whelan, this film feels like a rom-com. Anna is very regimented because she wants to make her parents proud by being successful. In the past, a plan served Anna well. It's Jamie's outlook on the future that changes her. He believes people should live life, not plan it. It's a sweet and somber love story that gives viewers a Hallmark ending with a self-love conclusion. The love feels real, but rushed, even with montages. The storyline, including the twists, is predictable. However, the film is funny. Netflix was the ideal platform for this film, but don't get a subscription to watch it.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Dutch III: International Gangster",
		"review": "Craze grabs food for Angel and Goldilocks as they await Dutch's instruction. She wants to settle the score with Zoom once and for all. Craze pleads with Angel to stay low, but questions Goldilock's loyalty. Angel assures Craze that Goldilocks is ride or die. Angel doesn't know Goldilocks is in communication with Detective Yates. She promises to put Angel and Goldilocks in witness protection if Goldilocks can prove Dutch is alive.<br/><br/>Dutch partners with Renato in Italy. Renato sells everything, but diamonds are his specialty. Mancuso stole Renato's rarest diamond, and Renato sent Dutch on a mission to find it. He eliminated Mancuso's crew and recovered weapons. However, Mancuso and the diamond weren't there. Dutch needs time and his crew. Renato obliges. Dutch has his interpreter, Carmella, request phony passports for Angel, Craze, and Zoom. Angel's rage boils over when she sees Zoom's passport. She vows to kill Zoom on sight. So, Craze and Angel fly to Italy without Zoom.<br/><br/>In Newark, Zoom's brothers forgive him for his past transgressions. Sugar Ray takes Zoom to the Sammy Education Center. He wants to open the doors soon, but lacks funding. Zoom wants to help, but he's living off his savings. Later, Carmella propositions Zoom with a video of Dutch, a bag of money, and a promise for more. Dutch needs his whole family to finish the diamond heist. Can this crime family turn Dutch into an international gangster, or will the family implode?<br/><br/>Based on Dutch III: International Gangster by Teri Woods, this gritty crime drama is a far cry from the source material. This review will focus solely on the film. The third installment of the Dutch franchise starts exactly where the 2nd film ends. You must see both films before diving into the third. Viewers will crowd the screen because Dutch must be five steps ahead while maintaining peace in the family. This film doesn't have the body count of the second but contains gripping storytelling. The director chose a wild juxtaposition of two couples coming to terms with their relationship. This emotional yo-yo will leave you satisfied with their decisions. The film contains Italian dialogue with English subtitles. This addition makes the setting feel authentic and raw. While the picture is captivating, the ending doesn't feel complete. This conclusion will make you hope for a part 4 to complete everyone's tale. However, the book series is a trilogy.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
