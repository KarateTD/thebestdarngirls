Finn, this movie can lead you down the rabbit hole if you don't know the clues to look and listen for while viewing.  This movie does a compelling job of keeping you guessing about each of the characters. While it does get your attention, there are moments the film will lose you.  Whether it's pointless dialogue or lackluster characters, your mind will wander.  Unlike Knives Out, this movie will not make you want to rewatch it for unseen clues.  One watch is enough to entertain and move on.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Zack Snyder's Justice League",
		"review":"After the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne, known as Batman, can't forget the warning Lex Luther gave him.  Lex warned something big is coming that will destroy all humankind.  So, Batman does the one thing he never thought he would do: team-up.  First, Bruce went to a small fishing village to find the sea protector, Arthur Curry.  Arthur, better known as Aquaman, gives Bruce a few choice words then disappears.  Diana overhears that the Shrine of the Amazons is on fire, and she knows it's a signal from her mother, the Queen of the Amazons.  She goes to the shrine, opens a cave, and reads the writings on the wall. In the past, man, Amazons, Atlanteans, Gods, and protectors of the stars got together to fight Darkseid and won.  After the battle, Darkseid left 3 Mother Boxes behind. For years, the boxes slept.  However, the Amazon's box awakens, and Steppenwolf followed the call.  He stole the first box from them, and he is on the hunt for the other two.  If he gets them and performs The Unity, the veil between Earth and Darkseid will fall. Bruce tells Diana that Arthur said no, so they decide to split up, go after the other two metahumans, and convince them to join the team.  Soon, they will realize that they need one more member, Superman.  His life kept Darkseid at bay and the Mother Boxes asleep, but they will have to find a way to bring him back to defeat the dark forces to come.  Lois is the key.<br/><br/>After fans demanded this version, they got four hours of what they wanted. Yes!!! This movie is four hours long with six parts and an epilogue.  Each part adds something new to the characters that we haven't seen before. Also, the plot gives us the origin story of the Mother Boxes, Steppenwolf, and the ultimate weapon.  With more time, the CGI team fixed some of the horrible graphics in the first film. And within this retelling, the writers give an alternate ending that feels like a love letter to the fans.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Coming 2 America",
		"review":"It's been 30 years since Prince Akeem went to America and defied his father and tradition to find true love with his Princess, Lisa.  Now, Akeem and Lisa have three daughters: Meeka, Omma, and Tinashe.  While Akeem loves his daughters, his father, King Jaffe, reminds him only a male can be heir to the throne.  General Izzi of Nextdoria is furious with Akeem because Akeem didn't marry his sister Imani. Izzi wants Meeka to marry his son to restore the bond between the two countries. Before Akeem can speak, King Jaffe calls Akeem to his sickbed.  A shaman saw a vision of Akeem's first-born, only son living in Queens. Jaffe tells Akeem to go to Queens and get his son.  Then have his son marry Izzi's only daughter, Bopoto.  Their family would still rule Zamunda, and Nextdoria's tradelines will open.  Semmi and Akeem travel to Queens and notice the changes to the neighborhood instantly.  They go to the local barbershop and show the shaman's drawing of Akeem's son, and the shop owners recognize the boy as Lavelle Junson and give Lavelle's location. After talking to Lavelle, Lavelle brings Akeem and Semmi to meet his family, including his mother, Mary. Lavelle doesn't want to go to Zamunda until he sees the gold bricks Semmi possesses.  Lavelle agrees to go, but only if Mary can go too.  Lavelle can't wait to be a prince.  But when this prince feels like a diplomatic pawn, will he fall in line or blaze his father's path?<br/><br/>The sequel to Coming to America has the laughs and lessons from the first movie.  A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",
