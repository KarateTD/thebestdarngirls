		"review":"Maggie has been Grace Davis's assistant for 3 years.  Grace Davis is a Grammy award-winning legend in the music world but her last album didn't chart as well.  Her long-time manager, Jack, wants Grace to consider doing a Las Vegas residency.  However, Maggie thinks she should record a new album. During Grace's meeting with a producer, Maggie opens up and gives her opinion.  Maggie points out everything the producer did wrong and plays Grace a mix she created.  Grace loved it but told Maggie to never pull a stunt like that again. While Jack thought the producer did a horrible job,Jack tells Maggie she ruined any opportunity Grace had to work with that producer in the future.  Feeling defeated, Maggie goes on a shopping trip for Grace and is interrupted by David.  They share some playful banter about music and he invites her to a party at his house later.  When Maggie leaves the store, she sees David get on the stage and sing. While she loves his vocals, she believes the mix is awful.  She lies and tells him she is a producer and can help him produce a great song.  While she is juggling Grace's life as her assistant, Maggie is juggling David's life as his producer.  She must do everything to keep the two worlds apart. With her future and present all on the line, everything comes full circle to reveal a long con.<br/><br/>With a strong soundtrack, including new and old music alike, this movie will have you bobbing your head and creating mental notes about the music you've overlooked. While the story does lag in the middle with spoiled diva outbursts and emotional breakdowns, it picks up with a strong reveal near the end.  Along with a decent story, The High Note provides a few good laughs thanks to Gayle and Jack.  This movie comes to one blaring commonality: insecurity kills dreams. So, what's holding you back? History, opinions, position, or insecurity.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Officer Renee Lomito has been cleared for active duty. Back on the force, she is paired with rookie Officer Danny Holledge.  On the beat, they hear a call over the radio.  One of their fellow officers, Kevin Ganning, failed to report back after calling in a suspicious driver.  Renee and Danny check it out.   At the scene, they find Kevin's car with flat tires, blood, and teeth.  As Danny investigates the scene, Renee looks at the dashcam footage.  It's choppy but she can see a green van without a license plate get pulled over.  Kevin sees something in the car, draws his weapon, and orders the woman out of the car.  After she gets out of the car, something snatches him into the air and violently slams him onto his car repeatedly.  Kevin screams, then disappears. Danny and Renee find Kevin hanging on a fence with his body split in half up to his chest.  When an investigator interviews Renee, they blame her for the dashcam footage disappearing.  Renee knows she didn't delete it.  Renee thinks something killed Kevin, she just doesn't know who, what, or why.  Renee looks for the van.  When she tracks it down, she traces it to a nurse named Taneesha and her son Demarco.  In her investigation, Renee will learn about the evil all around her.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Candyman, this movie provides a few jump-scares with social commentary.  Horror fans won't be surprised at any of the scary moments because they are accompanied by an anticipation score. You watch to understand why this entity is attacking cops as Renee pull the facts together.  If you are a mystery fan, this is a better movie for you.  It does offer some gory moments when you see the after-effects of the attacks. Great job to the makeup and art department for creating ghoulish scenes and victims.  This is a decent mystery to rent if you need a few scares and a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"In Venice California, a lonely and young Shaggy sat on the beach and pretended that sand mounds were his friends. Feeling sad for Shaggy, a dog emerged from one of the mounds. When an officer comes to take the dog away, Shaggy tells the officer the dog is his.  When the officer asks for the dog's name, the dog tells Shaggy he doesn't have one.  So, Shaggy makes up Scooby Dooby Doo. Shaggy gives Scooby his famous collar and Scooby promises to never take it off.  At the next Halloween, Shaggy and Scooby are trick-or-treating when they are accosted by neighborhood bullies.  They take Shaggy's candy and throw it into the haunted Rigby house.  The bullies are scared off by Fred.  Fred is trick-or-treating with Velma and Daphne.  They decide to go into the house to get the candy back.  To their surprise, they find a ghost.  Discovering the ghost is fake, they capture it.  Behind a curtain, Scooby finds a small Walmart.  They unmasked the ghost and discover Mr. Rigby.  He was selling stolen goods.  Today, Mystery Inc. has solved several crimes but they need an investor.  Their Mystery Machine is falling apart.  Simon Cowell wants to invest but not with the weakest links on the team. Simon doesn't understand what Scooby and Shaggy bring to the team.  The three struggle to come up with an answer but tell Simon that Shaggy and Scooby are their friends.  Simon's response is friendship doesn't save the day.  Insulted by the pause, Shaggy and Scoob quit Mystery Inc. and go bowling to drown their sorrows.  During their game, the alley is overcome by killer robots and the pair run.   They are beamed up by an unknown spacecraft.  Inside, Falcon Fury, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee explain they took the pair for their safety.  Dick Dastardly has one of the three ancient dog skulls to open the portal to the underworld.  Dastardly wants Shaggy but they don't know why.  On the ground, Velma, Daphne, and Fred discover their friends are missing.  With Velma's research, they learn Scooby is the final key to Dastardly's plan. To fight Dastardly, Scooby will have to break his promise.   Can Scooby and Shaggy's friendship survive while saving the world?<br/><br/>While it has all the classic characters, it doesn't have the same mystery.  The point of Scooby's mysteries was to tell children that monsters are real people.  Not ghost, goblins, or ghouls.  Anyone could be a monster.  You just had to dig deeper to find the truth.  This version of Scooby feels like it was created by Disney.  Having a story of true friendship is great, the writers could have created the plot with the same nuance and without tainting the original premise.  With that being said, the song selection for each scene was superb.  This version even took time to make fun of the 1969 classic cartoon while tipping their hat to the original voice actors and the creator. This movie will have laughs for adults but it will miss the mark for the hardcore fans.  However, kids will enjoy the movie's fun, story, and animation.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"Poppy is enjoying her reign as a queen with dignity and song.  Branch still lives in his bunker.  He has fallen in love with Poppy and doesn’t know how to tell her.  As the trolls celebrate the birth of Tiny Diamond, Poppy gets a letter from a rock star.  Queen Barb of the Rock Trolls plans to come to Pop Village and create one nation under Rock.  King Peppy reveals the Troll’s history to Poppy.  Many years ago, there were six strings that played different types of music: Pop, Country, Classical, Rock, Techno, and Funk.  Over time, they became intolerant of each other’s music and started to fight.  Each troll musical faction took their string and left.  Poppy refuses to run and wants to protect her kingdom.  She fires up a hot air balloon to find Queen Barb and the other factions.  Then, have a party to unite all the trolls with her pop sound.  Branch sees it differently.  He believes that Queen Barb is ready for a fight and prepares to fight back. So, he reluctantly joins Poppy.  Meanwhile, Queen Barb has gotten Poppy’s reply of friendship and she is disgusted.  She wants to unite the strings to make all the trolls Rock Zombies by playing the Ultimate Power Chord.  When every troll is the same, no one will fight.  As both Queens start their mission, they will learn the beauty of individuality, respect, and how history is written.<br/><br/>Based on Good Luck Trolls and the sequel to Trolls, this rainbow blast includes music for all ages and genres like Dee-Lite, Cyndi Lauper, Beethoven, Spice Girls, George Clinton, Baha Men, PSY, Chic, Scorpions, Daft Punk, and more.  Unlike other movies that teach children togetherness, it praises individuality through a groove, a riff, or a yodel.  With this storyline, you get 2 subplots.  The first subplot, Branch is finding a way to express his love for Poppy.  The second subplot, Cooper is finding his real family and music faction.  As a strong spectacle of entertainment, it surpasses the first movie and leaves you wanting more movies in the future.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
