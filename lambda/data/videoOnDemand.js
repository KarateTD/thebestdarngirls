		"review":"Eunice and her daughter, Lily, drive across town to move in with Eunice's fiancé, Adam, and Adam's three sons, Isaiah, Jacob, and Abe. At her new school, she tries to remain invisible, but she gets her first period in class and bleeds onto the floor.  Timmy points it out, and her classmates ridicule her.  She goes to the bathroom and cries. Then she hears a knock on the stall door.  It's Frankie, Tabby, and Lourdes.  They coax Lily out of the bathroom and to the cafeteria.  They see Lily's necklace has the symbol of the four corners, and they ask Lily to hang out with them in school and after.  The next day, Lily keeps her head down, but Timmy whispers something in her ear.  When he touches her, she puts her hand up, and Timmy flies across the hall and hits the lockers.  Timmy and Lily get detention, and Tabby, Frankie, and Lourdes see it all.  In school detention, Lily hears a voice telling her to grab her things and asks to go to the bathroom if she hears the voice in her mind.  She asks for permission to leave, and outside the room, Tabby, Frankie, and Lourdes all cheer.  Lily is their 4th.  Now, they can call the corners and have actual powers. But first, they have to go to the woods and bless their coven.  As they call the corners, they stop time, and their coven is blessed.  With their newfound powers, the quartet decides to get revenge on Timmy. As the girls grow into their powers, one goes too far, and someone dies.  Now, they have to bind the witch before she can do more harm.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Craft, this film has a lot of subtle references to the first movie without rehashing it.  It's not a retelling of the story but a continuation.  It does help to see the first to understand the twist coming in this film.  They took the things fans loved about The Craft and mixed in some Charmed to create a new story.  However, it still brings home the message of respect, sisterhood, and abuse of power. If you are comfortable with letting your child watch the first movie, the second will be acceptable.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"After We Collided",
		"review":"One month after their breakup, Tessa starts an internship at Vance Publishing, and Hardin gets a new tattoo.  On her first day, she has an awkward run-in with Trevor, from the finance department, in the elevator.  Kimberly tries to introduce Tessa to the boss, Vance, but he's on a conference call and pissed off.  Tessa gets settle and gets her first assignment. Tessa accidentally spends the night at work, and Vance wakes her up.  She impresses him with her initiative, and he tells her to get her things and follow him. After a long night of schmoozing and drinking, Tessa drunk dials Hardin and gives him a piece of her mind, then head to her hotel with Trevor.  Hardin pinpoints her location and heads to Tessa's hotel.  When Hardin arrives, he finds Tessa and a pantless Trevor.  Frustrated, Hardin kicks Trevor out and starts arguing with Tessa. In a few moments, they are in bed together.  With Hardin's mom coming to town, a relapse, and a car accident, fate will test Tessa's trust and Hardin's patience.<br/><br/>Based on the novel After We Collided and the sequel to After, this installment feels like a second book, for example New Moon or Fifty Shades Darker.  The author used this book to create a bigger story and introduce a romantic rival.  And it leaves on a cliffhanger like those books. This film isn't a movie for young kids or tweens, but older teens will enjoy it.  But parents, be ready to discuss toxic relationships and codependency.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Choir Girl",
		"review":"Photographer, Eugene takes pictures of the deplorable actions happening in his neighborhood, like overdosing children, assaults, and prostitution.  He goes to see Julius with the hope his magazine will sell his photos, but Anne, Julius's assistant, refuses Eugene first.  She thinks his pictures are voyeurism and exploitation, not journalism. Eugene walks home and hears a noise in an alleyway.  He follows the noise and sees a girl forced to take drugs while another girl lies beside her intoxicated.  Eugene grabs his camera and takes pictures. He sends the images to the magazine and gets nowhere again.  So he calls, and the receptionist forwards him to Polly.  Polly loves his pictures and wants to meet him at a bar to discuss more.  Eugene explains he doesn't know the girl, and he is not a stalker, but he wants to help her.  Then, use the profits to buy a house.  Polly tells Eugene she needs more images, so he goes back to the alleyway.  He sees a large guy dragging the girl out of the building and to the hospital. He shoots more pictures and helps her escape.  Out of the hospital and away from the enforcer, the girl tells Eugene her name is Josephine.  She wants to leave, but her pimp, Daddy, won't let her. Eugene offers her a place to stay to keep her out of the reach of Daddy. The next morning, Eugene meets with Polly, Anne, and Julius.  Anne still has reservations about the pictures, but Julius wants to publish them. As Polly and Eugene leave, he sees a van pull up.  Two men pull him into the vehicle and put a bag over his head. Daddy wants Eugene to bring Cherry, also known as Josephine, back to him.  Or Eugene must pay him $20,000 in a week. Daddy reminds Eugene he has a stream of income, Josephine.  He can prostitute her for the money.  How far will Eugene go or make Josephine go for her freedom?<br/><br/>Choir Girl is a very hard-hitting and, at times, hard-to-swallow movie.  It delves into the dark world you only hear about in rap music and doesn't hold back from the horror.  As Eugene deals with the moral dilemma of putting Josephine in the same situation he is attempting to save her from, you wonder is he doing it for her or himself. Sexual assault victims, be warned, there are extremely tough scenes to watch in this movie, and it could trigger PTSD.  With a compelling storyline, it will make you think of what you would do or would want someone to do if you were in their shoes.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"A slave wakes up on the back of a horse with no idea of her location.  The slave master pulls her off the horse, drags her into her new, yet dilapidated dwelling, and demands her name.  When she doesn't give it, he beats and brands her.  She screams her name is Eden. After the master rapes her, Eden closes her eyes, quietly cries, and falls asleep.  Dr. Veronica, Ph.D., is a successful author, mother, and wife.  She is a formidable pundit on cable news networks. After a successful speaking engagement, her friends ask her to celebrate with a night out on the town.  She has a great dinner but decides to head to her hotel.  She gets in her Uber and heads back. Then a man jumps from the backseat and attacks her.  When she opens her eyes, the world will change.<br/><br/>If you are expecting a traditional horror movie, then watch A Quiet Place or Nightmare on Elm Street.  Contrary to advertising, this movie is a thriller.  While watching, you figure out there is a connection between Eden and Veronica, but you don't know how they are connected. As you watch, compare the stark contrast between Eden and Veronica.  Their mannerisms, their display of emotions, their walk, and their bravado change with the political, social, and economic climate of their position in life.  With all Eden endures, Veronica is waiting.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney's Mulan",
		"review":"Hua Zhou sees his daughter, Mulan, who has a strong connection to the qi inside her, practicing her martial arts skills. However, he knows tradition says the qi is for men.  If Mulan uses it, she will be labeled a witch and shunned.  So, he tells Mulan to hide her gifts and bring honor to the family by marrying.  Years later, Mulan has an appointment to see the matchmaker. Mulan, connecting to her qi, catches the tea set, but she slips and drops it.  The matchmaker tells Zhou the Hua family has failed to raise a good daughter, and Mulan brought shame to his family.  Shamed, Mulan leaves the matchmaker with Xiu and her mother, Li, and sees the Imperial Army entering their village.  Bori Khan, a Rouran warrior, is on a mission to destroy Imperial China to avenge his father's death.  He has Xhin Lang protecting him.  Xhin Lang was labeled a witch and cast out of her village because she connected with her qi. The Army delivers the Emperor's decree that every family should give one son to fight the war.  Now, Zhou, a decorated and injured soldier, steps up because he has no sons. Zhou's volunteerism is accepted.  Mulan tries to convince her father not to go, but he boldly and abruptly stops her plea. As her family sleeps, Mulan makes a choice.  She takes her father's armor, horse, sword, and decree scroll and heads for the woods.  She will pretend to be her father's son, Hua Jun, and take her father's place in the Army. Zhou prays for their ancestors to protect Mulan on her journey to become a legend.<br/><br/>Based on Disney's Mulan and The Ballad of Mulan, the live-adaptation of Mulan has some glaring differences from the original movie.  However, it is a bold addition to the franchise.  With glorious landscapes, fantastic wardrobes, and magnificent fight scenes, Mulan will captivate you from beginning to end. With a few changes, viewers get a new story but the same message, never hide your gifts.  This movie classic isn't updated; it's renewed.  And it's enjoyable for the whole family.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
