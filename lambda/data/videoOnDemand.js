		"review":"Lucille Ball waits for her husband, Desi Arnaz, with the morning paper in her hand.  When he comes through the door, she wants an explanation.  It shows him enjoying drinks and details a wild night out.  Desi looks at the paper and tells her it's an old picture of an event she with him attended months ago.  Lucy remembers and kisses Desi.  As they kiss, a news report comes over the radio.  A well-known T.V. star pledges her allegiance to the communist party.  Lucy is the most-popular woman or man on television.  They know the radio host is talking about Lucy.<br/><br/>Monday, Lucy and Desi go to the executives to convince them of the truth.  Lucy tells them that 20 years ago, she lived with her grandfather, who fought for the little guy.  She checked the communist box to please him.  Desi and Lucy leave the office and head to the table-read for episode 204 of I Love Lucy.  They believe the show is ok, but this will be the most trying week of their marriage, T.V. show, staff, and cast.<br/><br/>It might shock people today, but I Love Lucy was a groundbreaking and provocative show for its time.  Lucy played a dopey woman on T.V., but she was a comedic genius battling tooth and nail for her art.  However, this movie doesn't make Lucy look like an angel.  Her strong demeanor came at the cost of her writing staff and her co-stars, Vivian and Bill.  You don't need to know much about Lucy, Desi, or the show to enjoy this movie.  But you will want to watch the show afterward.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars",

		"review":"With his baby on the way, Gus wants to do the honorable thing and marry Selene with his family and friends before the birth.  However, Selene won't give Gus information to divorce her estranged husband. The next day, Shawn goes to Jules for help doing a police search on Selene, but Jules refuses. Then, Shawn goes to Chief Karen Vick for help.  Karen doesn't help but knowingly leaves her computer unlocked with Shawn in the room.  Shawn looks for Selene in the database and finds nothing. With Gus's track record of dating killers, Shawn wants to investigate to protect his friend.  Gus wants to prove Shawn wrong. Will the real Selene please stand up?<br/><br/>Wait for it! This movie feeds its Psychos yet again while allowing the characters to grow.  Gus is the perfect groomzilla, with Shawn being the worst man and best friend at the same time.  Chief Lassie questions his ability to be a cop after his stroke in Psych 2.  And Karen battles with work-life balance after making it to the top.  It's great to see these characters stay grounded while their cases remain crazy. Yes, it helps to view the other movies and TV show because they make jokes from the source material.  Also, keep watching until the post-credits because fans get a glimpse of Psych 4.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Home Sweet Home Alone",
		"review":"As potential buyers go through their home, Pam and Jeff answer their questions.  While Pam is helpful, Jeff sabotages.  Jeff lost his job months ago and hasn't been able to find work.  They can no longer afford their home. When Jeff goes upstairs, he sees Maxwell come out of the bathroom.  Maxwell's mom, Carol, pretended to be interested in the home so Maxwell could use the restroom.  Maxwell sees Jeff pull a box of dolls from the closet and annoyingly asks questions. One doll is an ugly little boy with an upside-down head.  Carol, looking for Maxwell, comments that the dolls could be worth a lot of money.  After everyone leaves, Jeff looks up the dolls on eBay.  And the little boy doll is a rare mistake worth $200,000.  Jeff runs to the box, but the doll is missing.  He believes Maxwell stole it. At Carol's home, there is a lot of commotion because her entire family is there.<br/><br/>However, in the holiday melee, the airline split Carol's family into two flights. Upset with the crowded house, Maxwell escapes to the garage, gets in a car, and falls asleep watching TV.  In the morning, Jeff comes to Carol's house.  But the family says Carol and Maxwell left.  When the family leaves, Jeff considers breaking in but changes his mind.  Until he looks inside and sees Maxwell's coat with a noticeable bulge; the doll is in Maxwell's coat pocket. When Jeff tells Pam, she believes he has lost his mind.  But she changes her tune when she thinks about all the Christmases her family spent in that house.  Pam and Jeff go to an empty home to steal back the doll, but they discover someone is still inside.  It's Maxwell. He overhears Jeff and Pam talking about stealing the ugly little boy and selling him to an old lady.  He assumes they mean him.  With the boy in the house, Pam and Jeff need to devise another plan to get the doll, but Maxwell will be ready for them.<br/><br/>The sixth installment to the Home Alone series changes the script.  The kid is ultimately the bad guy in this story.  The change in dynamic makes you sympathize each time Pam and Jeff get hurt.  They are desperate people trying to save their homes.  Something a lot of people understand. While it's not the classic, you can use this film to get your kids to watch the first two.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"The Harder They Fall",
		"review":"Years ago, two men walked into Nat Love's home and killed his mother and father.  The man with the scorpion tattoo held Nat down while the other man took out a knife and carved a cross on Nat's forehead.  Today, Nat is a grown man, and he killed the man with the scorpion tattoo.  With the carver, Rufus Buck, in prison for life, Nat is ready to live the rest of his days with Mary. Nat crosses the bouncer, Cuffee, the door and heads to Mary.  As they talk, a fight breaks out, and Cuffee breaks it up.  But U.S. Marshall Bass Revees arrest Nat for the standoff.  Bass tells Nat that Rufus got a pardon with the help of Trudy and Cherokee Bill. With the man who made him an orphan free, Nat finishes his revenge with a trail of blood, bodies, and money behind him.<br/><br/>While the story is fiction, the people are not.  As this bloody western tale of revenge plays, don't be surprised if you look them up online and see their torrid past.  Using made-up stories with real characters isn't new.  But this movie delivers. However, it's the mix of modern and western slang that throws the movie off.  With so much attention to detail for the costumes and scenery, the dialect, not the dialog, feels neglected. Even if the story isn't true, writers need to have respect for the period.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
