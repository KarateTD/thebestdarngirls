		"mtitle":"Coming 2 America",
		"review":"It's been 30 years since Prince Akeem went to America and defied his father and tradition to find true love with his Princess, Lisa.  Now, Akeem and Lisa have three daughters: Meeka, Omma, and Tinashe.  While Akeem loves his daughters, his father, King Jaffe, reminds him only a male can be heir to the throne.  General Izzi of Nextdoria is furious with Akeem because Akeem didn't marry his sister Imani. Izzi wants Meeka to marry his son to restore the bond between the two countries. Before Akeem can speak, King Jaffe calls Akeem to his sickbed.  A shaman saw a vision of Akeem's first-born, only son living in Queens. Jaffe tells Akeem to go to Queens and get his son.  Then have his son marry Izzi's only daughter, Bopoto.  Their family would still rule Zamunda, and Nextdoria's tradelines will open.  Semmi and Akeem travel to Queens and notice the changes to the neighborhood instantly.  They go to the local barbershop and show the shaman's drawing of Akeem's son, and the shop owners recognize the boy as Lavelle Junson and give Lavelle's location. After talking to Lavelle, Lavelle brings Akeem and Semmi to meet his family, including his mother, Mary. Lavelle doesn't want to go to Zamunda until he sees the gold bricks Semmi possesses.  Lavelle agrees to go, but only if Mary can go too.  Lavelle can't wait to be a prince.  But when this prince feels like a diplomatic pawn, will he fall in line or blaze his father's path?<br/><br/>The sequel to Coming to America has the laughs and lessons from the first movie.  A very memorable moment is King Jaffe's funeral.  Not because he died but because he decided to do it while he was still alive.  He had Gladys Knight, En Vogue, and Salt-N-Pepa perform with a eulogy from Morgan Freeman. And the movie teaches the same lesson: the king has a lot to learn from his prince.  Seeing a prince follow his heart makes you fall in love with the movie again.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney Raya and the Last Dragon",
		"review":"Raya passed her final test, and she is the next protector of the orb.  Five hundred years ago, dragons protected Kumandra from evil spirits.  But the Druun was too powerful, so the dragons put all their powers into one orb, and the last dragon, Sisu, fought the Druun and merged her spirit into the orb.  The people of Kumandra battled over the orb, and the fight led Kumandra to divide into factions: Heart, Talon, Spine, Tail, and Fang.  The Heart faction, which Raya and her father, Chief Benji, belong to, possess the orb. At the gathering, Raya meets Namaari, the daughter of Chieftess Virana of Fang.  Both girls love the tale of the dragons, and Namaari gives Raya a necklace of Sisu.  Enamored by this gift, Raya takes Namaari to the orb, but Namaari attempts to steal it. The orb breaks, the Druun return, and each faction take a piece of the orb. Before the Druun turns him into stone, Benji throws Raya off the bridge and into the water below. It's been six years since the Druun returned, and Raya still searches for Sisu. Of course, Raya isn't the only person looking for Sisu; Namaari is too.  After performing a ritual, Raya wakens Sisu, and Sisu wants to see her brothers and sisters.  Raya tells Sisu that the Druun turned her fellow dragons into stone. Sisu and Raya want to put the orb and Kumandra back together, but she and Raya will face old enemies along the way: greed and mistrust.<br/><br/>With a lesson needed in today's society, Raya fits perfectly into the Disney franchise.  With elaborate settings and dazzling fight scenes, Raya and her flaws draw you into the plot.  But it's Sisu that keeps you watching.  This lovable dragon gains the powers of her siblings while maintaining her caring and trusting nature. With all this sentiment, the plot provides an abundance of laughs.  From a con baby to a little Forrest Gump, each character will connect.  Whether you see it on the big screen or watch it on Disney+ Premier Access, you will be an instant fan.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Our Friend",
		"review":"Journalist Matt Teague sits at his computer and starts to write about his wife, Nicole, who lost her battle to cancer.  The widower and father of two, Molly and Evie, writes about the time he came to Nicole's first play.  Nicole warns Matt that Dane, a stagehand who asked her out, will be at the cast party.  Matt agrees to go and be kind to Dane because Dane is respectful.  Then, Matt writes about Nicole's diagnosis, and Dane dropping his entire life to help them. Soon, Dane went from Nicole's friend to their friend. As their world comes to a foreseeable end, can Matt and Dane keep it together for the girls and Nicole's memory?<br/><br/>Based on The Friend by Matthew Teague, this movie starts as a story for a woman and becomes a thank you letter to a dear friend.  The movie opens with Matt and Nicole deciding to tell Molly and Evie that Nicole is dying in a few months. From that moment, the story isn't told in a linear fashion, so you must pay attention to the time and dates. It does run long but it gives a strong ending for your time.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle":"Disney Pixar Soul",
		"review":"Joe works as a middle school music teacher in M.S. 70.  During class, the principal calls Joe to the hallway.  They can offer him a full-time teaching position with time off and benefits, no more part-time work for him.  He goes to his mother's tailor shop, and Libba tells him that he must take the job.  Libba wants Joe to have a steady income with benefits, not an unstable gig, so Joe tells Libba he will take the job.  Joe gets a call from Curley, a former student, and Curley is a drummer for Dorothea Williams, a famous local jazz saxophonist.  Dorothea needs a new pianist. Joe runs downtown as fast as he can and meets with Dorothea.  She tells Joe to sit at the piano and join them.  At first, Joe is confused because he doesn't know the song they are playing, but then he gets into a zone.  When he opens his eyes, the band watches in awe.  Dorothea tells him to get a suit, come back at 9 pm tonight, and congratulations.  Joe made the band.  Excited, he runs home, talking on his phone, and falls into an open sewer. Now, Joe is a soul headed to the Great Beyond.  He runs from the Great Beyond, falls off the bridge, and falls into the Great Before.  All the soul counselors introduce themselves as Jerry.  It's their job to give souls their personality, but one spot remains open.  Once the soul fills that spot by going to the Hall of Everything, they get an Earth pass and start their life.  Jerry assumes Joe is a mentor for souls looking for the spark to fill the last spot.  After several failed attempts to return to earth, Joe sees he is not dead but in a coma at the hospital.  Joe decides to pretend to be a mentor and steal an Earth pass to get back.  Jerry assigns Joe to 22. Twenty-two doesn't see the point of living if dying is the result.  Joe and '22' make a promise, if he helps her find her spark, '22' will give Joe her Earth pass.  He will live, and she will never be born.<br/><br/>As usual, Pixar delivers the concept of life, death, and the beyond in a touching, palatable, and beautiful way.  To parents, there are plenty of jokes for you to enjoy.  But one concept that will pull you in is the land of Lost Souls.  Some of these lost souls aren't dead.   They are so focused on one thing that they stopped living their life. Putting an image to this concept will strike a chord with you.  This movie is a film the entire family can enjoy, and it's a strong entry to close out the year.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",
