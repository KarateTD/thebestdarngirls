		"review": "Janiyah wakes up her daughter, Aria, and takes Aria to the bathtub. Aria had a seizure and hurt herself in the tub. So, Janiyah wipes her back after removing Aria's science fair project from the tub. Aria informs her mother that she has a 40-dollar lunch debt. Janiyah promises to pay it. Janiyah runs to her car with Aria for work while her landlord screams for the rent. Janiya promises that she will get paid today and bring the rent on her break.<br/><br/>Janiyah starts her shift, and an unruly customer throws a bottle at her feet. Her boss, Richard, yells at Janiyah to clean the mess. Janiyah's okay, but the school calls. They reported Aria's bruises to child services. Richard tells Janiyah to be back in 30 minutes, or he will fire her. Janiyah runs to the Benevolent Bank and Trust to retrieve $40, but the bank won't let her withdraw it. She drives to the school, but it's too late. Child Protective Services takes Aria.<br/><br/>Janiyah drives to work but gets stuck in traffic. She tries to move around and almost hits another vehicle. The man, Oliver, chases her and crashes into her car. Janiyah's car stalls, and Officer Sam asks for her license and registration. Janiyah hands Sam her information, but the registration has expired. Sam impounds Janiyah's automobile, and she walks to work in the rain.<br/><br/>Janiyah sees another woman at her register. She took too long, so Richard fired her. Janiyah asks for her check on Richard's desk, but he says no. She returns home and finds her items, including Aria's medication and school project, on the ground in the pouring rain. She gathers the project and medicine and puts them in a clear backpack.<br/><br/>Janiyah enters Richard's office and begs for her check. He refuses as a man enters. The man reads Janiyah's name tag and calls her by her name. He pulls out a gun and demands the money in the safe. The man grabs Janiyah's bookbag, and she fights back. She snatches the gun and kills the robber. Richard remembers the robber said her name, so he calls the police and tells them she set it up. Janiyah rages, shoots Richard, and takes her blood-stained check from his desk, leaving the money behind.<br/><br/>Janiyah walks to the bank and steps up to Tessa's counter. She asks for her ID, but Janiyah doesn't have it. Tessa won't cash the check. Janiyah pulls out the gun and demands they cash it now. Tessa and the other teller, Rayah, assume she's robbing the bank. They give her money while Tessa presses the silent alarm. Bank manager Nicole informs the police that someone is robbing the bank. Then she sees Aria's project blinking and assumes it's a bomb. She warns the police. The security guard locks the doors as police surround the building.<br/><br/>Detective Kay Raymond and Grimes investigate the robbery and shooting at the grocery store. Kay views something different and familiar. She follows Janiyah's path to the bank and makes contact with Janiyah inside. She must convince Janiyah to come out peacefully before the FBI takes her down. However, Kay has one question. What was Janiyah's last straw?<br/><br/>Tyler Perry is back with a thought-provoking, heart-breaking, and breathtaking movie with a stunning twist. You can feel Janiyah's pain, desperation, and frustration resonate off the screen as she runs into a host of unfortunate circumstances. The picture shows different viewpoints on Janiyah's actions. Some call her ungrateful, but others disagree. It's a debate you will have with others as you watch. This film will captivate you from the beginning, and the end will shock you. It is worth a Netflix subscription.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "News reports blame the Traam social media app for the dissemination of AI-generated fake information, sparking unrest, violence, and deaths around the world. They are holding Traam's founder, billionaire Venish, responsible. His latest rollout of new features removed the app's guardrails. Then he calls his friend, millionaire Hugo.<br/><br/>Hugo is hosting a retreat at his newly acquired property, Mountainhead. Previously, Venish had not planned to attend. However, he alerts Hugo that he has changed his mind. Hugo laughs off his shock and calls billionaire Randall. The doctor confirms Randall's previous diagnosis. The cancer is incurable. He leaves the doctor on the tarmac and takes his helicopter to Mountainhead.<br/><br/>Hugo calls his friend, billionaire Jeff. Jeff built a superior AI engine that can spot deepfakes. He flinches at the thought of Venish but hopes the trip will be fun. Hugo asks his assistant to give Venish his bedroom and starts his meditation app. He will introduce it to his friends so they can offer suggestions and possibly invest in it. The four men arrive and state the rule: No deals, no meals, no high heels. Each has an ulterior motive to be there. Before nightfall, they will mark one of the men for death.<br/><br/>This dark comedy reinforces conspiracy theories about the uber-rich. These men have political figures on speed dial and can make a country go dark with the push of a button. They excuse each other's poor decision-making while believing they are altruistic. They are a sickening and somewhat authentic depiction of those in the tech industry. This film will make you reconsider leaning on the wealthy and technology to fix societal issues. It's not revolutionary but mildly thought-provoking. The plot builds up to nothing and leaves a disappointing conclusion. It's up to you to determine if it's a comedy or a horror film. This movie won't be a favorite, but it found a perfect place on Max.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "To Get Her",
		"review": "Janna is relaxing in the airport lounge with her husband, Marcus, and their daughter, Kiana, when Janna gets a work call. Her deal is about to collapse, and her boss wants Janna to return to the office to rectify the situation. Janna pleads with Marcus to go to Italy ahead of her with Kiana. She promises to be there the next day and put work aside.<br/><br/>Janna returns to the office and works through the deal. She calls her sister, Skyler, and updates her. She asks Skyler to join her and her family in Italy, but Skyler says no.<br/><br/>Janna is relaxing at home when Skyler knocks on the door. Skyler firmly convinced her tenant to pay. And her friend, flight attendant Sarayah, has a buddy pass. So, Skyler will make the trip. Skyler scoffs at Janna for missing her sparing time at the gym. Janna kicks the trash bag out of Skyler's hand to prove she still has skills. Skyler laughs and picks up the trash. Then, she finds a SIM card amongst the debris and puts it in her carry-on.<br/><br/>Janna and Skyler arrive and check-in. However, the concierge informs Janna that Marcus and Kiana haven't arrived. Janna calls Marcus, but her calls go to voicemail. Janna is on a mission to find her missing husband and daughter. And she will travel to the Italian underbelly to uncover the truth about their disappearance. Janna won't stop until they are together.<br/><br/>This film is an action-packed thriller with familial bonds, cons, and the mafia. Unlike other action films, this script calls out the protagonist's mistakes and misgivings. Also, Janna isn't a delicate flower that's unaware of the world around her. Thankfully, the writers didn't add an unnecessary love story to the plot. Janna solely focuses on finding her family. The plot injects the proper amount of humor during tense moments. This film will make you laugh, flinch, and swoon. Poor graphics and squibs aside, this film is exciting.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Firefighter Sam kisses her boyfriend, Noah, and drives to work. Before her day starts, Sam discovers she left her badge at home. Sam rushes to her home and hears the shower running. She assumes it's Noah and enters the bedroom to retrieve her badge. She sees Noah asleep on the bed. She opens the bathroom door and sees a woman's bra hanging off the shower frame. Sam rushes out of the house with Noah pleading after her. She refuses to accept his apology and goes to work. Her friend, Diane, calls. Their friend, Shannon, returned from her latest deployment. Diane wants to celebrate. Sam explains her heartbreak, but Diane expresses that Sam must party her sadness away.<br/><br/>Diane and Shannon attempt to lift Sam's spirits, but nothing helps. So, Diane calls her friend Cody. Cody runs the White Stallion Ranch and has a discounted, last-minute getaway. Sam begrudgingly says yes.<br/><br/>They arrive at the ranch and let loose. Cody made some calls and got the women an off-highway vehicle. They ride until the OHV stalls. Then, they check their phones and discover they don't have cell service. Shannon says they should walk. Diane, Shannon, and Sam travel to an airplane graveyard. They investigate the area, and a man, A.K.A., points a gun at them. His plane went down in the area, and he couldn't get a signal. The women refuse to accept their fate and look around the area. Shannon sees an antenna on the property and discerns that the manual override switch is nearby.<br/><br/>Shannon and Sam find the override and turn on the antenna. Then, a pod opens, and a woman, Gwen, exits it. She went missing 100 years ago. She remembers being on a ship and aliens stealing her likeness. Now, the group knows they are in deep trouble. They didn't save their lives. Instead, they sparked an alien invasion. Can they survive and save the world?<br/><br/>BET+'s first jump into the sci-fi genre offered great characters and graphics reminiscent of cult classics. Shannon, Sam, and Diane have deep backstories for the film's short running time and a close bond. One moment between two women could have fallen into the stereotype of fighting and slapping. However, they maturely converse, reveal mistakes, acknowledge shortcomings, apologize, and focus on their task. The writing makes up for the graphics and hazy film choice. The writers want to make a deeper statement, but it gets lost. While this won't be a BET favorite, it could become a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"review": "Stephanie is a crime-fighting vlogger with a new book, The Flawless Blonde. She has a reading and signing at a local bookstore. During the reading, Stephanie gets the shock of her life. After getting parole, Emily walks through the door in a jail-sheek outfit, including the chains. She asks Emily to be her maid of honor for her and her fiancé. Stephanie agrees after Emily threatens to sue Stephanie for using her likeness without permission.<br/><br/>Stephanie arrives in Capri and meets Emily's fiancé, Dante, and Dante's mother, Portia. As Stephanie greets the guests, she bumps into Emily's ex-husband, Sean, and their son, Nicky. Stephanie records during the welcome party, and several armed guards force her to stop. Stephanie discovers that Dante has a mob lineage and money.<br/><br/>Portia stands in front of the guests and announces that she has a gift for her future daughter-in-law. Emily's face drops when she sees her mother, Margaret, with another woman. The woman is Emily's aunt, Linda. Linda helped deliver the triplets. Sean laughs at Emily's family situation and states that Nicky will be immune because he's seeking full custody. Emily threatens Sean before he leaves.<br/><br/>Stephanie attends Emily's bachelorette party and walks to her room. She sees Nicky pounding on Sean's door because he forgot his key. Stephanie finds a maid to let her inside. The maid screams as they find Sean's body on the bathroom floor with blood coming out of his eyes. The Italian police label his death an accident, but Stephanie believes Emily killed him.<br/><br/>Stephanie's surprised to see the wedding continue without skipping a beat for Sean's death. She takes her martini and walks over to the shed. She sees Dante arguing with someone in the shadows. The culprit shoots him. Everyone has someone to vouch for their whereabouts during Dante's murder. Well, everyone except Stephanie. The Italian police put Stephanie under house arrest until they obtain enough evidence. Can Stephanie clear her name and find the culprit before they send her to prison?<br/><br/>This sequel has a higher body count but transforms a complex plot into a Lifetime movie. The mystery following the first murder regains your interest. However, the plot gives the viewers the breadcrumbs too early. The hair, makeup, and costumes are runway quality and have you envying both leads. And the 'Emily shot' of Stephanie will make you chuckle. This film doesn't surpass its predecessor, but it found a perfect place on Prime Video.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",
