		"review":"Jim anxiously awaits his daughter's return from college. He jumps to the door when Jenni arrives but isn't expecting her boyfriend, Oliver. Jenni excitedly shows Jim her engagement ring. He calms down and offers to help with the wedding. Jenni dreamt of having her nuptials at the same place her parents did, Palmetto Island. Jim calls, and the receptionist, Scarlet, remembers him. She reminds Jim that the island can only handle one wedding at a time. The earliest date Scarlet can find is July 1st. Scarlet starts to write Jim's information, but her empty pen leaves an imprint on the page. She reaches for another pen and has a heart attack.<br/><br/>Margot produces reality TV shows but halts when she sees her little sister, Neve, and Neve's boyfriend, Dixon, in the lobby. Margot can't take her eyes off Neve's engagement ring. Margot reminds Neve of their favorite place, the island where their grandmother lived, Palmetto Island. Margot offers to throw the wedding and calls the venue. The new receptionist, Leslie, answers and looks through the book. He doesn't see the imprint his mother, Scarlet, left. He books Neve's wedding for July 1st.<br/><br/>Margot, Jim, and the pair of newlyweds ride to the venue. After a discussion, they discover they have weddings booked for the same day on the small island. They run to Leslie, and he shows them Margot's reservation in the book. Jim reiterates that he booked his reservation with Scarlet. Jim sees the imprint and uses a pencil to expose it. Leslie realizes they double-booked the island. However, Margot's credit card is on file, so she gets the reservation.<br/><br/>As Margot watches Jim interact with Jenni, she feels sad about taking Jenni's venue. So, Margot and Jim call a truce. They pull Leslie aside and decide to break down the wedding and its events to accommodate both groups. Leslie agrees to this arrangement while Jim and Margot leave with a smile. This truce is short-lived. By nightfall, one couple will split, a dock will collapse, and an alligator will bite someone.<br/><br/>This movie is reminiscent of Bride Wars. Instead of the brides-to-be, it's the father-of-the-bride and maid-of-honor. Margot and Jim have an extremely co-dependent relationship with their loved one. This premise sets up the script for some humorous moments as Jim and Margot plot and scheme to outsmart each other. However, most of the jokes fall flat. It tries to be outlandish but becomes sad. The shameless cameos won't grab your attention either, but the saving grace is the unexpecting romance inside the comedy. The conclusion will make you laugh more than the movie. Viewers should save this movie as background noise on a rainy day.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 stars.",

		"review":"CIA agents Matt and Emily retrieve the Industrial Control Systems key from terrorists. The key can control any electrical system.

She tells him that she's pregnant with their first child. Emily starts feeling ill and races to the bathroom. However, the flight attendant says it's broken. Matt and Emily know the flight crew are terrorists, and they demand the key. They jump off before it crashes with the terrorist and key on board. Matt thinks someone in the agency gave them up. They decide to fake their death and live in the shadows.<br/><br/>Emily and Matt have new identities and two children, Alice and Leo, fifteen years later. Alice is a social butterfly and keeps secrets from Emily. Leo is a gamer who stresses about his health.<br/><br/>After her soccer match, Alice asks to study with friends. Emily and Matt agree, but Emily thinks Alice is lying. Emily hacks into Alice's computer and tracks underage Alice at an adult nightclub. Matt and Emily find Alice at the club and force Alice to leave, but a young man stops them. Emily and Matt use their skills to take down the young man and his friends. Emily, Matt, and Alice return home.<br/><br/>Emily and Matt answer the door and see Chuck on their porch. Someone streamed their fight and put it on social media. He warns that their location isn't safe. A terrorist shoots Chuck in the neck. Emily and Matt escape and rush to their kids. Matt admits that he removed the key from the box before he gave the box to the terrorist on the plane. He hid the key in the one place Emily would never look: her mother's home in England. They must grab their kids, fly to England, and retrieve the key before someone kills them or their children.<br/><br/>This movie has a score of action scenes, but the editing isn't smooth. It makes the audience feel disoriented. The script is funny and will connect to parents who've traveled with their family. The first plot twist is foreseeable, but the second points to a sequel. It won't be necessary, but viewers can see the pair team up again.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 stars.",

		"mtitle": "Too Many Christmases",
		"review": "Jerome cuts hair with his brother, Bryson. Their cousin, Lavar, brags about the many women who bought him gifts for Christmas. Jerome and Bryson laugh at Lavar because they are in committed relationships. Bryson will finally bring his new girlfriend, Cree, to meet his family. For the first time, Jerome will bring his wife, Kayla. Newlyweds Jerome and Kayla typically spend the holidays with their respective families. Jerome can't wait for Kayla to spend time with his family and their traditions.<br/><br/>Kayla decorates her tree when her brother, LeeLee, calls. His tour got canceled, and he's home for the holidays. With LeeLee in town, Kayla knows their mother, Regina, will want them to spend the holidays together. LeeLee decides to ask Jerome to spend Christmas with her family instead of his.<br/><br/>Kayla prepares Jerome dessert for dinner, and he knows something isn't right. She tells him that her family expects her to be with them from the holidays. She asks Jerome to consider canceling his plans and spending time with hers. Jerome jokes that the only solution is for them to be in two places simultaneously. Kayla takes him seriously and creates a game plan. They will celebrate with both families without them knowing. They will make elaborate ruses to leave and return on a schedule. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>This comedy will hit home for new couples. Jerome and Kayla spend the holidays apart during their relationship. So, their families never expected things to change. It's a plausible plan, but they forgot one glaring factor: their families. Lavar has a history with Cree, Pastor Davis doesn't accept LeeLee, and Kayla bought the wrong cookies. The plot balances humor with compassion exceptionally. It will make you laugh, clutch your pearls, and hug a loved one. This film could become a series with the proper script.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.",
